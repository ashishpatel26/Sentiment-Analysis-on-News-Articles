"First up, I’d like a quick note of thanks. Thirteen days into 2015, and I still haven’t subjected anyone to a piece about the 2016 Presidential election. Until today, that is, when it emerged that a possible Republican contender is suing the government for flying too many commercial jetliners over a piece of property that he owns in an exclusive enclave favored by his fellow 0.01 per-centers.","January 13, 2015","1","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"No, I’m not referring to Mitt Romney and the four-vehicle garage, complete with car elevator, that he’d sought to build at his house in La Jolla, California. He finally received zoning approval, in 2013, so by now the infamous elevator should have been installed. If so, it may have helped the Mittster clear his mind to explore another Presidential bid, an intention that he relayed to a group of donors on Friday.","2","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"

"I’ll get to that in a minute. First, back to the G.O.P. Presidential hopeful heading toward a courtroom confrontation with his local airport authority. It’s Donald Trump, of course. Speaking on a New York radio show over the weekend, Trump announced that he, too, is seriously—no, “very seriously”—considering a tilt at the Oval Office. “I’m going to Iowa. I’m going to South Carolina,” Trump said. “I’m going to New Hampshire. I’ve been invited by everybody.” And he went on: “I don’t know what it is, but I will tell you I do very well in the polls.”","4","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"It wasn’t immediately clear what polls Trump was referring to. But, on Monday, he revealed a cunning campaign strategy, designed to appeal to an important demographic that, hitherto, has been sorely neglected by both major parties: Americans who live near busy airports. Speaking to the Associated Press, Trump said that he is suing Palm Beach County for deliberately directing low-flying planes over his upscale beachfront resort, Mar-a-Lago, whose central building was commissioned by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the nineteen-twenties. “I am saving one of the great houses of this country and one of its greatest landmarks, and it’s being badly damaged by the airplanes,” he said.","5","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"At first glance, appealing to voters concerned about low-flying Boeing 737s might appear to be quixotic. But Trump isn’t as clueless as he sometimes appears to be. As a television celebrity who licenses his name to all sorts of projects, publicity is his lifeblood. Back in 2011, he briefly flirted with launching a Presidential campaign before deciding, quite sensibly, that his role on “The Apprentice” should take priority. Trump also knows that bashing an overweening government is a popular theme among what the G.O.P. activist Grover Norquist calls the “leave us alone coalition.” And Trump even acknowledges, if pressed, that there is a world beyond Palm Beach and the Trump Tower. “The real unemployment rate is twenty per cent,” he said on the New York radio show. “People are suffering out there. And the people that are most suffering are the people that don’t have much money to start out with.”","6","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"After that touching peroration, perhaps Trump could lend some of his wisdom to Romney, who, in many people’s eyes, is still associated with his unseemly, and ultimately devastating, remarks about the shiftless “forty-seven per cent.” If Romney is in deadly earnest about 2016—and an article in Tuesday’s Washington Post said that he is “almost certain” to run—he needs to undergo a serious rebranding exercise.","7","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"As every businessman knows, this is a very tricky proposition, especially when a competitor has already occupied the market niche you aspire to. In this case, the position is that of electable elder. Jeb Bush has all but confirmed that he’s in the race, and has signalled his intention to distance himself from the Tea Party/Rush Limbaugh wing of the party. What role is there for a second G.O.P. moderate who, just twenty-six months ago, in an economic environment that was far more friendly to Republicans than the one they are likely to face in 2016, lost handily to an unpopular President?","8","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"Most political observers believe the answer is none, which makes it hard to fathom Romney’s decision to assemble a new campaign team.","9","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"One possible explanation, proffered by Romney supporters to Chris Cillizza, a blogger at the Washington Post, is that Jeb is far more vulnerable than he appears. Once the media starts chomping on all the lucrative business projects that Bush has been involved with since leaving the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee, this theory goes, his chances of gaining the nomination will fall sharply. (Actually, the chomping has already begun.) And once Bush goes down, there will be an opportunity for Romney or another establishment candidate.","10","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"It’s also conceivable that Romney thinks he has learned from the mistakes he made in 2012, and that he matches up well against Hillary Clinton. (I haven’t seen any public polling that backs this up.) Evidently, he retains the faith in his own managerial abilities that was evident in 2008 and 2012. “There is something in Mitt that drives him to solve problems,” a Romney confidante told Cillizza. “When he sees something is a mess, he doesn’t have it in his DNA to sit back and let someone else just try to clean it up.”","11","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"Of course, it’s possible that Romney’s confidantes and political strategists are encouraging him to run for their own reasons. During the Mittster’s ill-fated 2012 campaign, Vox’s Matt Yglesias reminds us, his seven senior aides all earned more than the highest-paid figure in the Obama campaign. “Romney is surrounded by associates who have every incentive to tell him not just that Barack Obama is a bad president, and that liberal ideas are inferior to conservative ones,” Yglesias notes, “but that he in particular has unique attributes that call him to the stage of national leadership.”","12","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"In view of all this, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Romney hasn’t yet committed to anything. Some commentators think that he will come to his senses and forego another campaign. “He has to, right?” asks New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait. You would think so, but Romney has already been mulling this over for quite a while. The first stories suggesting that he was contemplating a third Presidential campaign appeared in the summer of last year.","13","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"Perhaps the lesson is that Presidential candidates aren’t like the rest of us. The same qualities of overconfidence, manic ambition, and propensity for risk-taking that enable them to embrace the horrors of a modern campaign also make it hard for them to grasp reality. Or, like Trump, they recognize that they have no chance of winning the nomination, but seek public exposure for other reasons.","14","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"In any case, with Chris Christie also reported to be edging toward declaring his intention to run, 2016 is shaping up nicely. That’s if you are a Democrat, a peanut-gallery member, or a right-wing Republican looking forward to watching the G.O.P.’s moderate candidates tear each other apart. Addressing his largely conservative readership, Christopher Bedford, the managing editor of the Daily Caller, chirped, “The first battle of the campaign is about to begin…. Put down the sword and grab some popcorn.”","15","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"There are two new signs that the Republican Party, often said to be in the midst of a civil war, might be experiencing something more like the Internet bubble of the nineteen-nineties. First, there’s the money: at a conference this weekend organized by Freedom Partners, a network built around the Koch brothers, donors met in Rancho Mirage, California, and resolved to spend eight hundred and eighty-nine million dollars—the sort of number that gets rounded up to a billion—on the G.O.P.’s 2016 candidates, according to the Washington Post’s Matea Gold.","January 27, 2015","16","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"At the same time, at the similarly named, but differently catered, Freedom Summit, in Des Moines, Iowa, an event built around the alarmist Representative Steve King, potential Presidential candidates were on full, exhibitionist display. Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum were there, each claiming his own place on the strutting-stridency matrix; so were Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. Special bonus: Carly Fiorina. (Bobby Jindal was at his own rally, called The Response.*) Their presence onstage suggests that the G.O.P. field is wide open—far more so than it is for the Democrats—attracting boom-towners and political Ponzi-schemers, as well as ideologues. There will be plenty of money—hard and soft, smart and speculative—expended as giddily as anything that was ever put into Kozmo.com. A bubble can be less corrosive and bloody than a war, and there’s always a chance that an unlikely startup might make for a successful I.P.O. But it is not dignified.","17","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"

"There were a lot of businessmen at Freedom Partners; there was a lot of talk about ordinary people and “crony capitalism” at the Freedom Summit. The latter event probably had the edge in theatricality. After watching several candidates, a Cedar Rapids billboard salesman told the Des Moines Register that he wished some of the “real true conservatives” had the “gravitas” of Chris Christie. Trump berated Romney (“He choked!”) and Sarah Palin improvised about the nature of freedom after her teleprompter went out (“The man can only ride you when your back is bent!”).","19","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"But it would be a mistake to see, in the coincidence of scheduling, a divide between the “establishment” and the upstarts. For one thing, a couple of the candidates, Walker and Cruz, made it to both Freedom pageants; Cruz, who in Iowa spoke about winning over “the forty-seven per cent,” spoke in Rancho Mirage about how the criticism of the Koch brothers was “grotesque.” Rand Paul and Marco Rubio opted solely for Freedom Partners, where Paul dismissed Romney, who was absent, in words only marginally more polite than Trump’s. Rubio, meanwhile, congratulated members of the audience for not trying to bribe him: “I don’t know a single person in this room who has ever been to my office … asking from government any special access.”","20","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"Jeb Bush missed both events; there may have been more people who were sorry about that in the Kochs’ circle than in King’s: it was King who described Dreamers as drug mules with “calves the size of cantaloupes,” which is not quite where Bush wants to be seen standing on immigration. (King’s Freedom Summit was co-sponsored by Citizens United, the group whose victory at the Supreme Court made all sorts of new political sponsorships possible.) Trump, in his speech, attacked Bush’s position on immigration this way: “He said, ‘They are coming for love.’ What? Half of them are criminals!” (A Politico dispatch describing the moment continued, “‘Jeb and Mitt you can’t have!’ Trump yelled. ‘It’s over!’”)","21","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"But the coolness to Jeb is more a matter of degree. According to the Washington Post, Paul, Cruz, and Walker were “favorites” at Rancho Mirage, too: “It’s not as if there’s one perfect champion and five bad individuals,” a “person familiar with donor views” told the paper. The Post added that Freedom Partners “is still debating whether it will spend some of that money in the GOP primaries. Such a move could have a major impact in winnowing the field of contenders but could also undercut the network’s standing if it engaged in intraparty politics and was not successful.”","22","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"Here, again, there might be an instructive contrast with the Democrats. The Republicans are looking at some dubious characters—but at least they are looking. If the G.O.P. is in a market bubble—whether of the tech or tulip variety—the Democrats might be experiencing something more like stagflation. The inflation is in the nominal price assigned to its main product, the putative candidacy of Hillary Clinton. That price keeps going up, without ever seeming to factor in her liabilities. The stagnation is in the party’s development of new voices, and, as a corollary, new ideas. In 2012, the Democrats benefited from the churn on the Republican side and the calm on theirs—but that’s largely because they were running an incumbent. (And it was Obama’s defiance of a similar sort of anointment that allowed him to emerge in 2008.) Now, there’s an artificial freeze on competition. Elizabeth Warren won’t say that she’s interested in running, and, even if she does run, her voice alone wouldn’t mean that there would be a broad debate. The peeps from the general direction of Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, have not been inspiring. (See Ryan Lizza on his travels with O’Malley.)","23","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"On both sides, in different ways, there might just be too much money chasing too few goods, to cite another economic dictum. Palin and Romney probably took the weekend’s prizes as the most mockable and the most mocked. And yet, they are also distinguished by being the only two characters in this ensemble whom the G.O.P. has put on a national ticket. If McCain had done just a little better, Palin might have had a chance to fidget at the State of the Union and mortify Americans with her behavior at state funerals. Romney got forty-seven per cent of the popular vote. Do Republicans see either of their nominations as an admonishment, or an inspiration? They made it to the finals; maybe anyone can.","24","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"

From the start of this year’s meeting, which is being live streamed on conservative Web sites, it has been clear that many of the attendees, and some of the presenters, too, regard Jeb Bush as someone who falls into the “insufficiently devoted” category—members of which are often referred to as RINOs (Republicans In Name Only). On Thursday, a packed crowd gave a rousing reception to Scott Walker, the up-and-coming governor of Wisconsin, who looks, at this early stage in the primary process, like Bush’s strongest rival.

"On Friday morning, the Bush-baiting continued. First into battle was Laura Ingraham, the talk-show host. “Why don’t we just call it quits,” she asked, during a breakfast-time appearance, “and Jeb and Hillary can run on the same ticket? I mean, going through the list of things they agree on: Common Core, amnesty, giving Obama fast-track trade authority, allowing the trade deals with China, the surveillance culture. So I’m designing the bumper sticker. It could be, ‘Clush 2016: What difference does it make?’ ”","29","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"After a couple of ho-hum speeches from Rick Perry and Marco Rubio, two of the would-be G.O.P. candidates in 2016, Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, took the stage. Many CPAC partisans regard the R.N.C. as the soggy, corporate-funded enemy within (which could also serve as a shorthand description of their feelings about the Bush family), but Priebus was there to be friendly. “There will be no coronation in the Republican Party,” he assured the crowd. “If you want to win the nomination, you’re going to have to earn the nomination.” Then came Donald Trump, who appeared to have spent the flight down to D.C. doing some handicapping. “Jeb Bush—he’s in favor of Common Core,” Trump said blithely. “He’s weak on immigration. I don’t see him winning.”","30","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"Many of the attendees would dearly love to believe that Trump is right in his analysis. He was followed by one of their heroes, Senator Rand Paul, who already seems to have been running for President forever. Paul didn’t address Bush directly: he didn’t have to. By the time he had taken some potshots at Hillary Clinton, promised to deliver the biggest tax cut in American history, and noted that America needed new leadership, elements of the crowd were chanting, “President Paul! President Paul!”","31","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"There was a lot of speculation about what sort of reception Bush would receive when he spoke in the early afternoon. The Washington Times had published a report about a possible walkout. At the last moment, Bush’s staff had switched the format of his appearance from a speech to a twenty-minute Q.-and-A. session with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. The change seemed like a sign of nervousness in his camp or, perhaps, a reaction to the widespread panning that his last big speech, about foreign policy, received.","32","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"It turned out to have been a smart move. Hannity was polite and respectful, and Bush appeared more relaxed taking questions than he had been while reading out loud. As the two of them took the stage, some Paul supporters did walk out, but the vast majority of the crowd stayed and listened to Bush describe himself as a “practicing reform-minded conservative.”","33","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"Some of those who remained weren’t convinced. When Hannity brought up immigration they booed, prompting Bush to quip, “I’m marking you down as neutral, and I want to be your second choice.” It was a good line, and Bush delivered other zingers too. Asked to respond to the words “Hillary Clinton,” he replied “foreign fund-raising,” a barbed reference to a Washington Post story, published earlier this week, reporting that the Clinton Foundation raised money from overseas governments during Hillary’s tenure as Secretary of State. When Hannity said “Barack Obama,” Bush replied “failed President.”","34","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"These gibes earned Bush some cheers. More importantly, though, he didn’t make any enemies, or any new ones at least. Indeed, he made a pretty convincing case that he is a committed conservative. (A couple of weeks ago, I made the same argument.) As governor of Florida, he reminded his audience, he cut spending, bequeathed his successor a budget surplus, and introduced the first statewide school-voucher system in the country. In a bow to supply-side economics, he said that he believed that tax cuts could create revenue. When the discussion turned to foreign policy, he welcomed Benjamin Netanyahu’s upcoming speech to Congress, saying, “We need to make clear that there is no light between us and Israel.” And then, shifting back to Obama, he accused the President of trampling on the Constitution and disrespecting America’s heritage. It wasn’t exactly Rudy Giuliani questioning Obama’s religion and love of country, but it earned Bush more applause, as Hannity wrapped things up.","35","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"
"The immediate response from journalists who watched the exchange was positive. “That had the potential to be disastrous, but Jeb turned in a really strong performance,” Jessica Taylor, the campaign editor for The Hill, said in a tweet. Evidently, even Laura Ingraham couldn’t think of anything particularly nasty to say. She contented herself with a tweet about Bush’s ties to the plutocracy: “Jeb Handlers will spin #CPAC2015 appearance as ‘brave,’ and ‘held firm,’ ‘didn’t back down,’ to reassure #DonorClass that he’s the one.”","36","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"

"Last night’s marathon celebration of “Saturday Night Live,” called “S.N.L. 40,” felt like an awards show: an Oscar night, in which “S.N.L.” both bestowed and received the honors. It began with an hour-long red-carpet special, in which chipper NBC mainstays, mostly from the “Today” show, asked forty years’ worth of mockers and mockees anodyne questions. (Say what you will about Brian Williams—he’s a person who’s able to process and facilitate humor.) Alec and Hilaria Baldwin, wary, stood with Sarah Palin, giddy, her hangups about the lamestream media momentarily gone in the presence of Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie. Palin said, of her 2008 appearance on “S.N.L.,” “It was the most fun moment of the campaign.” Baldwin said that “S.N.L.” creates “strange bedfellows” and suggested that Lorne Michaels “produce the Congress.” Dan Aykroyd said to Lauer, “I squint when I look down the hall, I see Tom Davis there with a script and his pencil, writing. I see Gilda, I see Johnny. It is getting to me a bit.” Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani, talking to Carson Daly, praised the show: strange bedfellows, united behind successful TV.","February 16, 2015","45","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"

"As the decades have gone on, “S.N.L.” has grown more comfortable with celebrating itself, which includes drawing on its history and its deep roster of alums and connections. Part of the pleasure of watching the show, in recent years, is wondering whether Tom Hanks or Justin Timberlake or Tina Fey will show up unexpectedly. When they do, everybody screams with joy. The continual insistence of “S.N.L.” on reminding us just who and what we’re dealing with has become a significant part of its power. In that context, and in the context of 2015, a spectacle like “S.N.L. 40” was inevitable. The digital age has ramped up our observation of anniversaries—at intervals, we have to re-discuss everything—as well as our nostalgia more generally, and our access to things from the past.","47","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"
"“S.N.L. 40” began with Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake doing one of their dazzling song-and-dance medleys, in which they ecstatically infuse already beloved songs, or, in this case, “S.N.L.” catch phrases—“Schwing!,” “That’s the ticket,” “wild and crazy guys,” “more cowbell”—with baby-faced positive energy, generating excitement while removing the originals’ edge. Though they’re both titans of late-night TV (Timberlake should be on NBC’s payroll, if he isn’t already), they’re quintessential ready-for-prime-time players. I like these routines—they feel like old-fashioned straight-up entertainment, danced and sung with joy—and when Fallon and Timberlake started singing and dancing like the Blues Brothers, I teared up from some combination of nostalgia and appreciation. But I also felt a twinge of unease: the pop over-reliance on referencing old things can dilute the wonder of the originals. And the more those two do it, the less we remember that the originals had any edge in the first place.","48","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"
"When Steve Martin came onstage for the opening monologue, saying things like, “Earlier tonight, when I was walking the red carpet that I have at home,” and comparing the show to a reunion at a “high school that is almost all white,” there was a satisfying feeling of being back in seventies and eighties “S.N.L.” territory, where a self-mocking slyness was the norm. Compared with Martin, eager-to-please Fallon and Timberlake felt uncomfortably similar to the “Today”-show interlocutors on the red carpet. Then came the deep bench: Tom Hanks and other stars appeared onstage. The next thing you knew, a small crowd including Peyton Manning, Miley Cyrus, Chris Rock, and Billy Crystal were watching Paul Simon and Paul McCartney sing “I’ve Just Seen a Face.”","49","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"
"The night proceeded in a well-organized succession of live sketches, themed segments, and musical numbers. Martin introduced a dizzying series of legendary clips, from Belushi’s learn-English skit to Nirvana’s set to Fey as Palin and beyond. Then Aykroyd, in his Super Bass-o-Matic ’76 outfit, came onstage and did a Bass-o-Matic 2150 sketch, complete with Laraine Newman saying, “Wow, that’s good bass!” I was so delighted by this that I felt a pang when Newman said “good bass” instead of “terrific bass.” But a slightly younger friend of mine, an hour or so in, remarked that watching the older sketches and characters—this, the Blues Brothers, Bill Murray as lounge singer—made him feel dutiful, like he was watching something from the nineteenth century. This was heartbreaking to me, but he wasn’t alone. It’s been said that we love the “S.N.L.” we grew up with best, and I watched those sketches in afternoon reruns in the eighties, a time less removed from the nineteenth century. To me they are “S.N.L.,” along with a few other golden eras.","50","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"
"The show’s “Weekend Update” segment provided something for both of us: delirious happiness, in the form of Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Jane Curtin at the anchors’ desk. “Viewers of ‘Saturday Night Live’ span several generations, from Baby Boomers to Generation X all the way to whatever you call the little dummies who are live-tweeting this right now instead of watching it,” Fey said.","51","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"

"Emma Stone came out and did a fun Roseanne Roseannadanna; Edward Norton played Stefon (“This week’s hottest club is called YANK!”); the real Stefon came out; Melissa McCarthy appeared as Matt Foley; Fey answered the door and was devoured by the Land Shark. The show was both tribute and time squish, tinged with sadness about mortality: a lot to process on a Sunday night. Like the Internet, like iTunes, like so much these days, it was a levelling and shuffling of decades. “S.N.L. 40” was both the best of everything and a mashup that approached mishmash: a comedic Bass-o-Matic 2015.","53","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"
"Many former cast members, some who haven’t popped up on “S.N.L.” in many years, returned in beloved old roles: Rachel Dratch, as Debbie Downer; Will Ferrell, as Alex Trebek; Norm McDonald, as Burt Reynolds as Turd Ferguson; Joe Piscopo, as Frank Sinatra; Dana Carvey, singing his “choppin’ broccoli” song; Adam Sandler, as Opera Man, confusingly riffing on “Fiddler on the Roof”; Bill Murray, tearing into the love theme from “Jaws,” with a good long bleeped-out part in the middle and Paul Shaffer on the keys; Steve Martin, popping out of a sarcophagus, singing “King Tut”; and so on. Chris Rock gave an ecstatic and heartfelt speech about Eddie Murphy—“Every couple of years, the media tries to call some new comic the next Eddie Murphy,” Rock said. “There is no next Eddie Murphy! Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Eddie Murphy!”","54","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"
"Murphy, who had not been on the show in some thirty-five years, had said to his red-carpet interviewer that no, he was not nervous—he didn’t get nervous. He came onstage, accepted his standing ovation, smiled and clapped, thanked everybody, made some off-the-cuff remarks—it was like being back at his old high school, he said, to respectful quiet from the audience—and then mocked the crew for not having already cut to a commercial. Rock’s introduction seemed like a ta-da to nowhere: even Murphy wasn’t the next Eddie Murphy.","55","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"
"Throughout the show, there were moments that indicated that Murphy’s old high school was a mostly white one, as Steve Martin had said. When Jerry Seinfeld came onstage to do a bit about taking questions from the audience, the “S.N.L.” alum Ellen Cleghorne stood up and asked, referring to long-standing criticisms about the show, “Why aren’t there more black women?” But the joke here was that she meant “in general,” not on the show. Ha ha. Then she asked how many black women were on “Seinfeld.” He said, “Good point, Ellen! We did not do all we could to cure society’s ills. Mea culpa.” Later, Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin sent their love to Tracy Morgan, who was severely injured in an auto accident last year. Baldwin imitated Morgan’s distinctive way of talking, which was jarring and which obscured a good Morgan-style joke. It reminded me, as Fey’s Cosby impression at the Golden Globes had, of the scene in “30 Rock” when Liz Lemon imitates Tracy Jordan and Tracy’s wife says, sagely, “Don’t do impressions of other races.”","56","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"
"At the end of the show, it was great to hear “You are watching Cable 10, Aurora, Illinois, community-access channel” once again—with the old graphic and Phil Hartman’s voice-over—and to see Wayne and Garth, after everything they’ve been through, looking and acting impressively like their teen-age selves, with drumsticks and ripped jeans and the awkward, gentle joy that that sketch originally had. In fact, one of the real pleasures of watching “S.N.L. 40” was seeing these people—older, multimillionaires or not, franchises or not, slim or not, happy or perhaps not—reinhabit the characters they were before all of that happened, before peers like Belushi and Hartman and Chris Farley died. These were the characters created by hard work and improvisation, by young people fuelled by genius and possibly by cocaine. With them, we returned to the people we were then—junior-high-school kids, up too late, imagining a world bigger than we knew; college students connecting to the Zeitgeist; adults trying to cope with the election season—and were left to contemplate where it might all end up.","57","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/saturday-night-live-celebrates"
"Here in Boston, we’ve gotten about seventy-two inches, or six feet, of snow in the past seventeen days, which is a record, besting the previous thirty-day total by more than a foot, with thirteen days to spare. It’s been cold during this stretch, too, so most of the snow has yet to melt. What hasn’t been trucked away remains in hulking piles, in neighborhoods from downtown to the city limits. The way we talk about the snow—mostly in passive verbs—expresses the general feeling of impotence and powerlessness produced by the current weather pattern. Snow is something that you get, like the flu.","February 11, 2015","58","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/big-snow-social-media-age"

"In real life, the day-to-day has mostly taken place on a continuum of inconvenience: shovelling every other morning, frantically seeking a parking space that isn’t being saved by someone’s deck chair or vacuum cleaner, walking through sidewalk snow canyons, sinking into the occasional slush puddle, and, for many, enduring tortured commutes, either on public-transit systems that have been delayed or closed entirely, or on slick, jammed roads made narrower than usual.

The car on your street that hasn’t been moved, or even cleared, since the first storm looks like the same creampuff icebergs as all the other ones on Twitter. Your forgotten side street, with banks at six feet on either side, and a narrow corridor with tire tracks down the middle, looks a lot like the ones posted on Facebook from Southie or Brighton. There is comfort in seeing your experience endlessly replicated, something that almost feels like camaraderie.

"Watching the weather has become a full-time, multi-platform pursuit. The Weather Channel long ago gave up any pretense that it didn’t know what the rest of us are afraid to admit: that the weather is entertaining, and that bad weather is very entertaining. Even the staid and sturdy National Weather Service buries a little doom-and-gloom poetry in its Winter Storm Warnings—and they seem to be having a good time of it on Twitter. For most of us, there is a lingering feeling of childhood glee at a coming snowstorm, with its promises of a day off and “The Price Is Right” at eleven in the morning. (Even that wears off, though: Boston schools have had more snow days this winter than in the past twenty years, and have already cancelled two of the city’s great regional school holidays, Evacuation Day, on March 17th, and Bunker Hill Day, on June 17th. April vacation is imperilled as well.) All of the measuring and record-keeping stimulates a competitive American spirit; if it’s going to snow, it might as well snow the most it ever has. When a storm misses New York and hits Boston instead, we may even feel a tinge of superiority as we chuckle at the overreaction of our frenemies to the south. When a storm tracks out to sea, as the one that threatened for Thursday looks likely to do, relief is mixed with disappointment. But there’s always this weekend, and the latest projections of the European model will be out soon!","64","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/big-snow-social-media-age"
"Boston has found new ways to measure snow. On Tuesday, the Boston Globe charted the snowfall against the heights of Boston’s favorite athletes.

"We’ve also found new ways of disposing of it: on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s Mattapan line, they employ something called Snowzilla, a snow-blower powered by an old jet engine from the Korean War. Boston has been trucking snow out of the city, taking it to huge empty parking lots out near the airport, which they are calling “snow farms.” Once the farms got full, the city started using snow melters to make room for more truckloads.","66","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/big-snow-social-media-age"

"And we have new reasons to complain about the same old problems: The T is old and unreliable, and parking is impossible. The M.B.T.A. was abruptly shuttered on Monday night, and closed all day Tuesday, after it proved itself to be entirely incapable of operating safely or on a reasonable schedule, much to the obvious disgust of the new Massachusetts governor, Charlie Baker. The transit authority’s C.E.O., Beverly Scott, has taken to disparaging her own trains and buses, saying, “This is not a spring-chicken system by any stretch of the imagination.” On Wednesday, inspiring little confidence, she announced, “The old lady is moving.”","70","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/big-snow-social-media-age"
"Meanwhile, winter parking, always a minor blood sport, has become more perilous than ever. In recent years, the city has tacitly approved the longstanding de-facto practice of space saving: if you take the time to shovel out a space, you can block off that space while you are away—with a chair, recycling bin, or, in the case of someone on the next street over from me, a cardboard box full of hockey sticks—for up to forty-eight hours after a snow emergency has ended. The problem, though, is that we’ve rarely had forty-eight hours without a snow emergency in the past few weeks, and, regardless, people keep the spaces longer than they are supposed to. Sometimes, good Samaritans (or bad ones, depending on your view of things) will move a space saver that’s been left out too long, or the city will come by and remove them, leaving an open spot that is quickly snapped up. But when the person who tried to save the spot returns to find it occupied, they may assume that the person moved the saver, violating some old-world code of parking honor. In my neighborhood, there are rumors of a parking vigilante, a tire slasher who’s been going around enforcing his own notions of frontier justice on cars he thinks have been taking spaces or parked in someone else’s spot. It’s happening just a few streets over from my apartment, but that’s essentially another universe. I heard about it on Reddit.","71","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/big-snow-social-media-age"
"After looking at photos of other people’s snow-covered streets on Twitter and Instagram all day, it is both startling and rather comforting to venture outside. Up and down the block, at night under the streetlights, I see my neighbors, nearly all of them strangers, shovelling out their cars and driveways and sidewalks. We smile at one another and laugh, exasperated, and say the usual things you say in the face of such terrible weather. Sometimes we pause to take pictures of all the snow with our phones; some of them will be up on Facebook before long, but we won’t be seeing each other’s, since we aren’t really friends. Thankfully, though, other people we know elsewhere in town are doing the same thing, and we’ll hear about it soon.","72","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/big-snow-social-media-age"
"Last fall, George Pataki, the former governor of New York, announced that he was considering a run for President. Since then, he’s been making the rounds on Fox News, taking shots at his rivals for the Republican nomination and, with nine visits to New Hampshire since October and another scheduled for next month, establishing himself as a regular on the state’s first-in-the-nation primary circuit. “I have no doubt in my mind that I have the ability to run this country well,” Pataki told the Daily News.","April 23, 2015","73","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"","74","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"The country is less than convinced. To the extent that a possible Pataki candidacy has been noticed at all, it has been roundly panned. “In politics, you never say never,” the Democratic consultant George Arzt said. “Here, you can say never.” Pataki is not well known outside of his home state, hasn’t held elected office in eight years, and will turn seventy this summer. And yet he seems to be genuinely considering a run. The question, as when Pataki flirted with a bid four years ago, is why. “Pataki—I’m puzzled about this,” Larry J. Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told me. “I don’t even know what he’s been doing. Has he been on corporate boards?”","75","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"The 2016 G.O.P. field is bursting with candidates who have practically no chance of victory. Sabato’s influential Crystal Ball report, which tracks political races across the country, currently counts nineteen potential candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination. Twelve of them have no shot at winning, Sabato said, adding, “and I’m being generous to some of the other seven.” (His generosity does not extend to a perennially rumored candidate whose name is absent from the list. “We couldn’t include Donald Trump and live with ourselves,” he said.)","76","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Sabato’s Crystal Ball has broken down the Republican field into four tiers. At the top are the “Leading Contenders,” who include the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, and the Florida senator Marco Rubio. Sabato estimates that there’s a seventy-five to eighty per cent chance that the nominee will come from that tier. Pataki is one of seven candidates crowded into the “Gadflies and Golden Oldies” tier, at the bottom. He’s joined there by, among others, the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O. Carly Fiorina (“Largely unknown,” the Crystal Ball notes. “No base of support”), the former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore (“Jim who?”), the onetime Maryland governor Bob Ehrlich (“No rationale for candidacy”), and the former United Nations ambassador John Bolton (“No electoral experience or donor base”). “Even if a lot of the people talking about it today don’t wind up running, we could still be looking at a record number of candidates,” Sabato said.","77","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Why are so many experienced people lining up for a race that they cannot possibly win? For some, there’s a genuine call to serve, or a desire to influence the Party’s platform. And, to be sure, the absence of a clear Republican front-runner gives hope to dreamers everywhere. “They start wondering, Maybe I can catch lightening in bottle,” Sabato said. He told me that a candidate in the bottom tier had called him recently and said, “Just wait till I get on that debate stage!”","78","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"For a number of the candidates, however, the chances of actually securing the nomination don’t appear to factor into the decision to run. It is now so easy and so lucrative to mount a campaign for President that, even given the current historically crowded field, it’s a wonder that still more people aren’t running. “The primary process is a spectacle now, and that’s a relatively new development,” Sean McKinley, a Ph.D. student in the politics department at Brandeis University who researches the rewards of unsuccessful campaigns for President, said. “There are increased incentives for people to run, and there are fewer downsides, so why wouldn’t you run?”","79","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"McKinley researched Presidential races between 1976 and 2008, and found that losing candidates benefitted enormously simply from having run. Senators who had only narrowly won earlier elections suddenly found themselves retaining their seats by comfortable margins, despite not having shown well in the Presidential race. For example, in 1970, Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat, won a relatively close Senate race in Texas against the future President George H. W. Bush. Six years later, when Bentsen ran both for President and for reëlection to his Senate seat, he was clobbered by Jimmy Carter in the Presidential primaries but won his Senate seat by fifteen points. He was reëlected to the Senate twice more by comfortable margins, and was Michael Dukakis’s nominee for Vice-President in 1988.","80","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Participating in the public-speaking circuit has emerged as an especially profitable side benefit of running for President. It was reported last year that Hillary Clinton was earning as much as three hundred thousand dollars per appearance at colleges and universities. It’s unlikely, of course, that a middling politician who lacked Clinton’s fame would command such a figure simply for having lost a bid for the White House, but Clinton’s rising tide is widely understood to have lifted all fees. Some of McKinley’s research has focussed on candidates who wound up signing with speaking-engagement agencies after failed runs for President. Gary Bauer, for instance, saw his run, in 2000, as a social-conservative candidate founder after disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire, but he is still available for bookings through the All American Speakers bureau. For many similar candidates, McKinley said, “the only thing they really had on their C.V. was that they had run for President. So if you’re a politician reaching the end of your career, and maybe you haven’t earned as much as you could have in another field, maybe you consider running for President to raise your profile for the speaking tours.”","81","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"That comment brought Pataki to mind, but McKinley points in his research to an even more obscure example: Mike Gravel, a former Democratic senator from Alaska who last served in 1981. After Gravel, who is now eighty-five, announced in 2006 that he would run for President in 2008, he managed to land a book deal. Then, despite a largely ignored campaign, in which he ran first as a Democrat and at the end as a Libertarian, he was able to sign for a time with the Harry Walker Agency, a prestigious speakers’ bureau.","82","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"It would probably be unfair to characterize Gravel’s run for President as having been about personal enrichment. He has spent much of his career working on the issues that motivated his campaign—political empowerment for everyday citizens, the war on drugs, the entanglement of military spending and bellicose foreign policy—but the run did wind up benefitting him financially. These days, he is the president and C.E.O. of a company called KUSH, which plans to produce marijuana-infused products, such as lozenges. “There’s no question that running for President helped me get the job with KUSH,” Gravel told me. “It probably was window dressing to have a Senator and a former candidate for President.” He told me that he doesn’t receive a salary, but did get stock in the company, which is a subsidiary of Cannabis Sativa, Inc., on whose board he also sits. (The C.E.O. of that company, by the way, is Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, who ran for President as a Libertarian in 2012.) “There are people who are much, much beyond their prime of effectiveness who are running for President for the visibility,” Gravel said.","83","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O., appears to be elevating the personal-enrichment campaign strategy to a kind of performance art. She was cited in a poll, released earlier this week, as only two per cent of Republicans’ first choice for President, but will announce her candidacy on May 4th, a day before the release of her new book, “Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey.” “She may win the Newt Gingrich Award for 2016,” Sabato said, and gave Fiorina no chance of actually winning the nomination. “Newt was definitely seeing his book sales go up during his 2012 run—it almost seemed like that was the point of his run, and then he got on a roll and won South Carolina! It was almost by accident.”","84","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Today’s media cycle presents even marginal candidates with endless opportunities to generate headlines that burnish their brands. “There are shades of Marshall McLuhan,” David Michaelson, whose firm, David Michaelson & Company, is a leading authority on the effectiveness of communications and public relations, said. “The medium is the message. Think of a campaign not as a run for office but as an opportunity to tell a story. Think of a campaign as not a campaign but a media platform for your issues or your brand.” And the brand that you’ve built follows you long after you’ve abandoned your campaign. Michaelson cited the example of the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who earned a reputation during his unsuccessful 2008 run as a folksy, conservative truth-teller, an identity that helped him land a talk show on Fox—which he recently left in order to explore a 2016 campaign.","85","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Underscoring—and underwriting—all of this is the fact that it has never been easier to raise the money required for a run. Changes in campaign-finance laws now allow rich donors to essentially give unlimited amounts of money to support a favored candidate. The former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, for example, ran as a kind of boutique candidate for the Wyoming mutual-fund operator Foster Friess. Though he struggled to raise money elsewhere, Santorum was able to win eleven primaries and caucuses thanks largely to the more than two million dollars in donations he received from Friess. The pair are reportedly considering a second act in 2016.","86","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"“Campaign finance is going to continue to change the shape of politics, as people realize how permissive the laws are,” McKinley said. He expects that we’ll see even more candidates running in future elections. “There are very few rules left. You may have to solicit money from only a couple dozen people.”","87","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"What this means in practice is that some candidates who are hoping to last only long enough in the primaries to cash in later on will no longer have to engage in the unpleasant act of begging lots of people for relatively small amounts of money. “You have to be the kind of person who’s willing to do the kinds of things required of a person running for President—kissing babies and asking people for money—that many of us would find distasteful,” McKinley said. “But even those things are getting easier. You don’t even really need to go out and solicit money anymore.”","88","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"

"Set aside, for a moment, his repeated refusal, in the past few days, to say whether he believes that President Obama loves America, or whether he believes that the President is a Christian, and look instead at Walker’s record running what used to be one of America’s more progressive states. Having cut taxes for the wealthy and stripped many of Wisconsin’s public-sector unions of their collective-bargaining rights, he is now preparing to sign a legislative bill that would cripple unions in the private sector. Many wealthy conservatives, such as the Koch brothers, who have funnelled a lot of money to groups supporting Walker, regard him as someone who’s turning his state into a showcase for what they want the rest of America to look like.","98","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"But just how threatening is he? If you’ve been following the political news during the past week, you may well have the impression that he’s stumbling in his campaign for the 2016 G.O.P. nomination. Among the political commentariat, the consensus of opinion is that Walker’s repeated refusal to distance himself from Rudy Giuliani’s incendiary comments about Obama, and his subsequent encounter with the Washington Post’s Dan Balz and Robert Costa, during which he appeared to question Obama’s religious faith and took some shots at the media for asking him silly questions, weren’t merely reprehensible: they were serious gaffes that raised questions about Walker’s political abilities.","99","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It wasn’t just liberal columnists who piled on. In a column at the Daily Beast, Matt Lewis, who also writes for the Daily Caller, said that Walker’s comments raised the question of whether he “might not be ready for prime time on the national stage.” Lewis went on: “Conservatives should be worried that Walker hasn’t proven capable of navigating these land mines.” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who is a former G.O.P. congressman, wrote at Politico: “Good candidates know how to make dumb questions look, well, dumb.”","100","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Rather than deflecting the reporters’ queries about Obama’s beliefs, as other Republicans had done, Walker used them to send a none-too-subtle message to Republican voters. His refusal to say whether Obama was a Christian wasn’t merely a shot at a hostile media. As Dana Milbank, of the Washington Post noted, it allowed Walker to “wink and nod at the far-right fringe where people really believe that Obama is a Muslim from Kenya who hates America.” Milbank also wrote that Walker was “refusing to grant his opponent legitimacy as an American and a Christian.”","101","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"In a more just world, Walker’s indecent and craven antics would disqualify him from playing any further role in the Presidential race. But in the current political environment, his tactics, far from hurting him, may well bolster a candidacy that is already thriving.","102","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Having cemented his reputation as an economic conservative, Walker is busy making a concerted effort to win over social conservatives and evangelical Christians, some of whom apparently believe that Obama is the Antichrist (or perhaps the Seventh King). Earlier this month, during a trip to London, he refused to say whether he believed in evolution, commenting: “That’s a question a politician shouldn’t be involved in, one way or the other.” In addition to making that hat tip to the Book of Genesis brigade, Walker has been reiterating his opposition to gay marriage and taking a notably harder line on abortion than he did during his gubernatorial reëlection campaign, last year.

"Evaluated in this context, Walker’s comments, or refusals to comment, about Obama’s beliefs look less like gaffes and more like carefully considered elements of a larger plan—and one that’s working for him. On Tuesday, the research firm Public Policy Polling released the results of a new national survey of Republican voters, which showed Walker leading the G.O.P. race, with twenty-five per cent of the vote. He was seven percentage points ahead of the candidate in second place, Ben Carson, the author and neurosurgeon, and eight percentage points ahead of Jeb Bush. “Walker is climbing fast in the polling because of his appeal to the most conservative elements of the Republican electorate,” said P.P.P. “Among ‘very conservative’ voters he leads with 37% to 19% for Carson, 12% for Bush, and 11% for Huckabee.”","104","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"This is just one poll, and the sample size was small—three hundred and sixteen—but recent state-level polls also show Walker near or in the lead. In California, according to the highly respected Field poll, he’s favored by eighteen per cent of Republicans. Bush is in second place with sixteen per cent, and Rand Paul is in third place with ten per cent. In Texas, a survey carried out by the University of Texas at Austin shows Walker running second, but he’s trailing local boy Ted Cruz by just one percentage point. When a previous poll was taken, in October, only two per cent of Texan Republicans favored Walker; now, he’s standing at nineteen per cent. In South Carolina, according to another P.P.P. survey, he’s also running second, just one point behind Bush, and leading Lindsey Graham, the state’s senior representative in the U.S. Senate.","105","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It’s still early, very early, of course. But Walker is an ambitious and determined politician who has already been through one tough race—his 2012 recall election—that subjected him to a great deal of media attention and hostility from Democrats. Thanks to his ties to the conservative plutocracy, he’s almost certainly going to have some serious money behind him, and he is trying to pitch his campaign in the sweet spot of G.O.P. primaries, where conservatism and antagonism toward coastal élites meets electability. He has the advantage of youthfulness, at age forty-seven, and, finally, as he pointed out to a convention of Christian broadcasters on Monday, he is, “unlike some out there,” a self-made fellow who “didn’t inherit fame or fortune from my family.” That jab was presumably aimed at Jeb Bush, but if Walker were to get the G.O.P. nomination, it could be modified and directed at Hillary Clinton, assuming that she wins the Democratic nomination.","106","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"

"Fifty years ago this May, Joe Allen named a restaurant after himself and changed the course of pre-theatre dining. A Queens native, Allen had got out of the Army a few years earlier. Life then was “pre-Columbian,” he recalled recently—“The world wasn’t round; you got to the edge and you fell off”—until he got a job at P. J. Clarke’s. In 1965, he took over two adjacent Forty-sixth Street properties on the wrong side of Eighth Avenue and combined them to form his eponymous restaurant.

Allen obtained a poster for the ill-fated production and hung it on the wall. The next year, he added the poster for another fiasco, a “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” musical starring Mary Tyler Moore. The “flop wall” became a Joe Allen signature—the posters now cover the restaurant. (Most recent addition: “Holler If Ya Hear Me.”) The original criteria, Allen said, were “costing more than half a million dollars and running less than a week.”","109","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/trifecta"

He wore a plum-colored sweater and ratty jeans, and sat next to his wife, DD Allen, an interior decorator and architect. The place became a theatre-district staple, with regulars including Roy Scheider and Lauren Bacall, who sang a showstopper set at Joe Allen in the 1970 musical “Applause.” The crack years were tough: there were vials on the staircase, and Allen had to call in the vigilante group the Guardian Angels. In 1983, he opened Orso, an Italian restaurant, in the town house next door; it was named after a dog that used to wander around outside the Gritti Palace, in Venice. Allen’s empire expanded to Paris, Los Angeles, and London. Ten years ago, he opened Bar Centrale, an impossible-to-get-into show-biz lounge, in a space above Orso that had been the staff changing room.

Five years ago, an Oscar-obsessed coat-check attendant named Joe Major started the Joey Awards, honoring the trifecta’s achievements in serving, bartending, and other essentials. Since Allen’s restaurants tend to employ aspiring performers, the awards have blossomed into a ceremony, with musical numbers and a red carpet. Allen had never attended—“I thought it might be inhibiting to be there”—but this year he was cajoled.

Best Coat Check went to Joe Torello (Tuesday dinner), who said, “First of all, thank you to the managers, because, without you telling people to, no one would ever check their coats.” Best Leading Waiter was expected to go to Jeffrey Gift, the Meryl Streep of the Joeys (he had won every previous year), but Chris Rozanski pulled off an upset, for his Saturday-night shifts at Joe Allen.

Priebus’s memories of 2012, when the competition was intense and curiously entertaining, are by his own admission a little nightmarish.

The idea that the major parties should have a role as gatekeepers, as a shield against the excesses and illusions of pure democracy, seems almost quaint when the largest field ever may be at the starting gate.

Sometimes, they prevailed. In “The United States of Ambition: Politicians, Power, and the Pursuit of Office,” Ehrenhalt focussed on state and local races, but his argument encompassed national candidates, too, and as a general rule it could describe many people in politics who have ambition, a lot of free time, communication skills, a personal fortune or wealthy backers, and no obvious qualifications (either by training or experience) to deal with the real world beyond America’s borders.","117","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/g-o-p-s-2016-position-plays-republican-primaries"

In the commercial world, positioning means showing why the attributes of Tide have a broader appeal than the promises of Wisk.

Rick Perry’s main theme, since he ran for President in 2012, has been making the borders less porous, but he’s also made an effort to protect his position with Latino voters. In a Q&A with the Wall Street Journal the other day, he said, “Americans want to have a thoughtful process in place, following the rule of law to allow people to immigrate to this country . . . in a legal way”—a position with which it’s hard to take issue. Marco Rubio, who has modified if not changed his position, now emphasizes the borders, too. Rubio may emerge as the grandmaster of positioning in general; not long ago, he spoke to CBS and said, “The future is now. It’s here. It has arrived.

"Siegelman, a Democrat, served a single term in office, from 1999 to 2003, in the last days before Alabama turned into an overwhelmingly Republican state. He’s spent the subsequent decade dealing with the fallout from the case that landed him in prison—a case that, at its core, is about a single campaign contribution. Siegelman ran for office on a promise to create a state lottery to fund education in Alabama. The issue went to a ballot question, and Richard Scrushy, a prominent health-care executive, donated five hundred thousand dollars to support the pro-lottery campaign. (Voters rejected the lottery.) After Scrushy had given the first half of his contribution, Siegelman reappointed him to Alabama’s Certificate of Need Review Board (the CON Board), which regulates health care in the state. Scrushy had served on the CON Board through the administrations of three different governors. The heart of the case against Siegelman came down to a single conversation that he had with Nick Bailey, a close aide of the Governor’s, about a two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar check from Scrushy for the lottery campaign. As summarized by the appeals court:","125","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"

"In 2006, after a district-court trial before Judge Mark Fuller, Siegelman was convicted of seven counts, including bribery, conspiracy, and fraud. He was acquitted of twenty-two charges and sentenced to seven years in prison. (An appeals court overturned two of the seven convictions and allowed Siegelman out on bail during some of the time his case was on appeal.) Siegelman is currently incarcerated in a federal prison in Oklahoma; his projected release date is in 2017.","127","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"Throughout Siegelman’s legal ordeal, the Supreme Court has been in the process of deregulating American politics, most notably in the 2010 Citizens United decision. In that case, the Justices found that money is speech—that contributing to a political campaign amounts to a protected activity under the First Amendment. As the appeals court in Siegelman’s case noted, the charges in his case “impact the First Amendment’s core values—protection of free political speech and the right to support issues of great public importance. It would be a particularly dangerous legal error from a civic point of view to instruct a jury that they may convict a defendant for his exercise of either of these constitutionally protected activities.”","128","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"It seems clear that Siegelman was conducting the seedy, but routine, business of contemporary American politics. Scrushy contributed because he wanted something in return, which is why many, if not most, people contribute to political campaigns. (George Will made this point in a column in defense of Siegelman.) Why do “bundlers” become Ambassadors in congenial countries? Why do local contractors support mayoral candidates? Why do real-estate developers give to prospective (and incumbent) governors? Because they want something. Siegelman was convicted because the quid pro quo was too “explicit”—but, beyond the conversation about what Scrushy might want, there was no clear evidence that it was. Thanks to the courts, the line between illegal bribery by campaign contribution and the ordinary business of politics has all but disappeared. Throwing a man in prison for activity at the murky barrier between the two is simply unjust.","129","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"Siegelman should be freed, too, because there was a distasteful overlay of politics to his prosecution. According to an affidavit filed by a Republican lawyer in Alabama, senior state Republicans, in the aftermath of the 2002 election, said that Karl Rove, then a top White House aide to President Bush, had promised them a Justice Department investigation of Siegelman—an investigation that then took place. The matter of White House interference in the case is unproved, but Rove certainly proved, later in the Bush Administration, that he was willing to manipulate United States Attorneys for the political advantage of the Republican Party. Given the ubiquity of quid-pro-quo politics in Alabama (and most other states), the case against Siegelman appears selective indeed.","130","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"
"There is another reason to question the harsh sentence dealt to the Governor. The behavior of the judge who imposed it is more than questionable. On August 10, 2014, Judge Fuller was arrested for domestic violence in an Atlanta hotel after his wife called 911. Shortly after his arrest, Fuller accepted a plea deal that would allow him to expunge his criminal record if he stayed out of further trouble. But the standard of contact for federal judges should be a great deal higher than “not exactly a felon.” At the moment, Fuller is not hearing cases, but, inexplicably, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has failed to remove him formally from his duties, and the House of Representatives has yet not begun impeachment proceedings. The state’s U.S. senators have called on Fuller to resign, but he has refused, and continues drawing a federal paycheck while doing no work. (Yesterday, Siegelman’s lawyers argued before an appellate court that the verdict should be overturned because of the alleged involvement of a lawyer who had been recused.)","131","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman"

"Last year, Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of the anti-poverty confederation Oxfam International, was named a co-chair of the World Economic Forum’s planned meeting in Davos, Switzerland. This month, as the Davos conference was about to begin, Byanyima’s organization released an eye-catching report about the concentration of global wealth in the hands of several dozen billionaires, among them a number of Davos regulars. Oxfam’s publication, a follow-up to a report released around this time last year, found that the eighty people atop the annual Forbes list of the planet’s richest individuals have amassed about the same amount of wealth as the billions of people who make up the world’s poorest half. It also found that the richest one per cent of people in the world own forty-eight per cent of the world’s wealth—a share that, if it keeps growing at the current rate, will pass fifty per cent by next year. “The scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering,” Byanyima said in a press release attached to the report.","January 28, 2015","133","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"Byanyima’s comment and the Oxfam report were purposefully timed. The unequal distribution of global wealth figured prominently in Davos discussions this year, and the report garnered coverage in prominent news outlets around the world. Even Hillary Clinton referenced it, in a speech in Winnipeg. But some prominent journalists—Felix Salmon, of Fusion, and Ezra Klein, of Vox—have challenged the report’s findings. “This version of Oxfam’s report is just as crap as the last version,” Salmon writes. Salmon and Klein make similar criticisms, related to how the report takes debt into account.","134","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"","135","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"To calculate the wealth of the bottom half of the population, Oxfam used research by the Credit Suisse Research Institute, which found that global household wealth—that is, assets like housing and investments, minus debts—totalled two hundred and sixty-three trillion dollars last year. The poorest half of the world’s adults own less than one per cent of that amount—less than two trillion dollars. Oxfam worked down from the top of Forbes’s list of the world’s billionaires, adding up their net worth until it reached the amount held by the poorest half. It took only eighty billionaires to get there.","136","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"Salmon and Klein argue that this method is misleading, because the wealth estimates all take debt into account. Going into debt is far more common in the U.S. and Europe than in less developed places, where it’s more difficult to access credit. “So for the purposes of Oxfam’s calculation, a farmer in China’s rural Sichuan province with no debt but also very little money is wealthier than an American who just graduated from medical school with substantial debt but also a hefty, six-figure income,” Klein writes. For that matter, Klein points out, Hillary and Bill Clinton, who were in debt when they left the White House, would have been poorer, too. In a sense, being able to go into debt is a privilege—and the greater a person’s status, the greater his access to debt often is. (It’s hard to imagine the Clintons being denied a loan.) In other words, Oxfam’s measure of wealth, which counts the most indebted person in the world as the poorest, includes a number of people who, by global standards, are quite privileged.","137","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"Klein and Salmon make a legitimate point—but it doesn’t matter much at all to Oxfam’s broader conclusion about the wealth gap. True, the organization’s figure would seem to lump indebted American doctors and former Presidents with less fortunate indebted people and poor, but not indebted, people in the developing world. But data suggests a strong correlation between households’ income levels and their net worth; as the former rises, so does the latter. In other words, people with high incomes but negative net worth are the exception, not the rule. To factor out those people, you can drop the bottom ten per cent of the wealth distribution from Oxfam’s calculation; this group includes those whose debt exceeds their wealth (not only high-income earners but also people with lower wages whose debt outweighs their wealth), plus some people with no wealth or small amounts of it. The rest of the bottom half still holds only about $2.6 trillion, versus the figure of under two trillion that Oxfam used to arrive at the marquee eighty-billionaires statistic.","138","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"On Monday, Nick Galasso, an Oxfam researcher, responded to critics in a blog post, calculating that the new $2.6-trillion figure amounts to the wealth held by the hundred and forty-seven richest people in the world. That doesn’t make for quite as striking a headline, but this version of the calculation doesn’t do much to change the share of wealth held by the richest one per cent in the world, either: it falls from 48.1 per cent to 47.9 per cent, Galasso found. (Salmon, in his post, adds up the wealth of some in the poorest half who have positive net worth, but he doesn’t discuss how this impacts Oxfam’s over-all conclusions.)","139","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse Research Institute report from last year whose data Oxfam used, considers the criticism from Klein and Salmon about debt to be a “silly argument.” “That’s a non-issue. It’s a diversion,” he told me. Debt is a perennial problem when using net worth to measure inequality, but other approaches, like comparing income and consumption, pose challenges of their own. Comparing income, for example, can make a rich, but unemployed, heir to a fortune held in a tax haven seem poorer than a fast-food worker. And comparing consumption, which usually involves looking at purchases of household staples, makes rich people and poor people look more similar than they are: “I don’t think Donald Trump drinks more milk or eats more bread,” Galasso told me. As the economist Branko Milanovic pointed out in a blog post on the Oxfam report, economists generally choose the most appropriate approach for their particular goal. (Milanovic, for his part, has found that global income inequality may be decreasing, but he told me that he finds Oxfam’s approach, in showing a rise in wealth inequality, to be sound. “The methodology is quite established and most of the critiques are misguided,” he wrote in an e-mail.) Galasso said that Oxfam chose to focus on wealth, in this case, because wealth is associated with power, political and otherwise, and Oxfam worries about the concentration of power in the hands of the affluent élite; Klein, of Vox, discusses this in his post. (I wrote about the link between riches and power in a post about Sheryl Sandberg’s wealth that discussed last year’s report from Oxfam.)","140","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"This isn’t to suggest that Oxfam’s report doesn’t have genuine flaws. For instance, Shorrocks joins Salmon in taking issue with another high-profile aspect of Oxfam’s report: its projection about the future. Oxfam, by examining the trends since 2010 and extrapolating into the future, shows the wealth share of the top one per cent going up and up; it passes fifty per cent by next year, and rises past fifty-four per cent by 2020, painting a picture of a world in which wealth becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of the élite. But, Shorrocks said, this extrapolation assumes that the global economic trends since the recession will continue to play out exactly as they have so far.","141","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"The main reason the super-rich have seen their wealth expand so much since 2010 is that stocks have risen a great deal. Affluent people are much more likely to hold stocks than the poorer half of the population, so they’ve benefitted more. But, with European economies in crisis, the Russian economy floundering, and Chinese growth slowing, stocks may not keep rising forever—or even for the next five years. “If asset prices go on increasing as they have since the financial crisis, then it’s quite likely that [Oxfam’s] projection will be correct,” Shorrocks told me. “But it is conditional on that, and I don’t think anyone’s really expecting that to happen.”","142","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"

"The names that now form in readers’ minds a kind of canon of New Yorker fiction began to appear in the magazine well before this decade: John Updike’s first story, “Friends from Philadelphia,” found a home here in 1954, when he was twenty-two (and was followed by many more—forty-five between 1965 and 1975). The door had been opened to John Cheever back in 1935, and this decade saw the final stories of an outpouring that included the classics “The Swimmer,” “The Country Husband,” and “Goodbye, My Brother.” The magazine had already published in its entirety, in 1961, Muriel Spark’s “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,” and more than three dozen works by Mavis Gallant (who went on to publish seventy-seven more). The year 1965 saw the last of J. D. Salinger’s baker’s dozen of stories, “Hapworth 16, 1924”: the final words Salinger published in his lifetime, the end of an era in American fiction, and perhaps the beginning of a new one.","159","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/1965-1975"
"In 1961, the thirty-two-year-old Donald Barthelme first appeared in the magazine, with No. 1 of a hundred and twenty-one explosively strange yet unforgettable non-narratives.

"It was a time of change, a time of messing with the narrative line, a time of meaning and deliberate avoidance of meaning, a time of colloquialism, absurdity, and desperation, all in crazy coexistence with the more traditional strands of fiction. Read Barthelme’s iconoclastic prose poems alongside the sly shtetl fables of Isaac Bashevis Singer or Jorge Luis Borges’s multilayered allegorical teases, both of which were first published in The New Yorker in 1967, or Ann Beattie’s playful, sad comedies of misconnection, which began to appear here in 1974, and you have a sense of the literary disjunctions, as well as the writers’ common goal: to pull us all into the political, cultural, emotional maelstrom of the era.","161","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/1965-1975"
"There are so many people who consider Chris Christie a true friend, according to Chris Christie. This isn’t just a matter of love but of legality, because New Jersey’s ethics rules stipulate that the state’s governor has more leeway in accepting gifts from his personal friends than from, say, businessmen with an interest in the Port Authority, or from the king of a Middle Eastern country. Unless, that is, the governor is a guy like Christie, whom no mogul or monarch could resist. According to a report in the Times, when Christie was asked why King Abdullah of Jordan “picked up the tab” for a weekend getaway for the governor—and three of his children, his wife, her mother, his mother, and his stepfather—his office cited the true-friend rule. “King Abdullah invited the governor and his family to Jordan as his personal guest so the two families could spend time together,” a spokeswoman told the paper. They’d met at a dinner given by Mike Bloomberg, a detail that was somehow offered as proof that the relationship was real. The family time included a thirty-thousand-dollar bill at a Kempinski hotel and “a Champagne reception in the desert.”","February 3, 2015","162","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"
"","163","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"
"True friendship was also the reason Christie didn’t worry about going to football games with Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys. As I’ve written before, one of the puzzles in that story, as in this one, is whether Christie believes his own excuse—that his wealthy hosts take disinterested pleasure in his company—or is offering it cynically. The first suggests a delusional faith in his own charm (and that of his stepfather, mother-in-law, etc.), the other an openness to trading on his office. Neither is good, and both make him vulnerable.","164","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"
"He acts as though that hadn’t occurred to him. “I relish these experiences and exposures, especially for my kids,” the Times quoted him as saying. “I try to squeeze all the juice out of the orange that I can.” He seemed to assume that he’d be regarded—even praised—as a doting father, rather than as a dubious politician.","165","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"
"Friendship isn’t everything. Christie also signed an executive order that made it possible for interest groups and foreign governments to pay for him to go around the world, as a travelling advertisement for New Jersey. The vacation in Jordan came at the end of a junket to Israel—a trade mission—for which the many Christies flew on a plane owned by Sheldon Adelson, the gambling magnate who has spent millions on Republican candidates and is likely to do so again in 2016. (See Ryan Lizza for more on the Christie-Adelson relationship.) Part of that trip was paid for by a group called Choose NJ, which, the Times noted, “is financed by companies that are forbidden by pay-to-play laws to donate to the governor.” Its president is a neighbor of Christie’s. Choose NJ paid for a Christie trip this week, which is why his measles-abetting remarks about parental choice and vaccines were issued from the United Kingdom. Some of the reports on the measles story included a photo of Christie and his wife, Mary Pat, visiting a British company, in a lab coat and goggles.","166","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"
"All this is emerging during the rush for potential candidates to get commitments from big Republican donors, which turned into a free-for-all after Mitt Romney announced on Friday that he wouldn’t run. Earlier that day, Mark Halperin, of Bloomberg, reported that one factor Romney and his circle had considered was what they saw as Christie’s unsustainability: “Thanks to the 2012 veep vetting process, Romney became intimately familiar with some of the less publicized controversies from the New Jersey governor’s past, and believes that several of those flaps would mushroom so broadly that Christie soon would be eliminated from consideration by voters and donors.” There was a similar message in “Double Down,” the book that Halperin wrote with John Heilemann. Still, Romney and Christie had dinner Friday night. Whatever doubts Romney may have about Christie, he apparently doesn’t want to help Jeb Bush. And someone has to win the Republican nomination.","167","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"
"That person will probably face Hillary Clinton. One defense Christie has, which Joe Scarborough, of MSNBC, quickly offered Tuesday morning, is that Clinton has a wealthy-host problem, too. Hers might be bigger, if one factors in Bill Clinton’s travels and the stray oligarch in their circle. That suggests some dispiriting prospects for 2016. If it’s Clinton vs. Christie, there will be private planes spotted in all directions. If it’s Clinton vs. Bush, there will be no dodging of dynasts. We may be looking forward to a campaign defined by operatives leaking duelling flight manifestos, questionable consulting agreements, and intemperate statements by former Presidents turned campaign surrogates. But maybe we’d have that no matter who the candidates are. It’s better than letting the money change hands in silence.","168","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"

"The fight to bring marriage equality to all fifty states heads to the Supreme Court again later this month, with an extraordinary two and a half hours of oral argument set for the morning of Tuesday, April 28th. The four cases before the Court deal with marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee. But their potential repercussions are much broader.","April 8, 2015","181","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"Two years ago, the Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in the landmark case of United States v. Windsor, where it held, in broad language, that Congress could not deny federal recognition to same-sex marriages performed in states that permit them. Now marriage-equality activists hope that the Court will extend the Windsor rationale and language into a rule that requires every state to allow gays to marry. Most observers expect that it will, and that the impact of such a ruling will eventually extend beyond marriage rights, transforming how gay Americans are perceived and reducing discrimination against them more broadly.","182","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"","183","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"With the Court seemingly on the verge of an historic precedent, the selection of the lawyers for oral argument became a point of some contention among the many attorneys involved in the various cases.","184","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"During a confidential selection process that included a “moot-off” (essentially Supreme Court auditions), lawyers for all of the plaintiffs agreed on Mary Bonauto—who argued the first successful gay-marriage case, in Massachusetts, in 2003, and who has been one of the leading advocates for the cause since its inception—as their main advocate before the high court. She will argue on the central question framed by the Court: “Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex?” Although a leading advocate for marriage rights, Bonauto has never argued a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. She will tell the Justices that marriage restrictions deny gay Americans their right to equal protection of the law and that such statutes also deprive them of a core liberty protected by the due-process clause of the Constitution.","185","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"Joining Bonauto will be a veteran Washington and Supreme Court litigator, Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, who will argue on the second question the Court has framed: “Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?” An affirmative answer on the first question would seem to render the second moot.","186","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"The U.S. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli, Jr., will argue, on behalf of the government, for a fifty-state marriage rule. This is a broader position than the government took two years ago, when it argued against DOMA but for a more incremental approach to the marriage question itself. (It argued then, convolutedly, that only states that grant legal recognition to gay relationships should be forced to grant marriage rights.) The government’s position has strengthened as support for marriage equality has increased nationally, and as the Administration has seemed to recognize that the issue resonates with its political supporters.","187","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"Arguing against marriage rights will be John Bursch, a former Michigan solicitor general, and Joseph Whalen, a Tennessee associate solicitor general. All four states are defending their marriage prohibitions.","188","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"In the two years since the Court last faced this issue, the nation has seen unprecedented political and cultural changes in attitudes toward same-sex marriage. In 2013, when, alongside the DOMA challenge, the lawyers Ted Olson and David Boies argued their challenge to California’s Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in that state, only nine states allowed gay marriage. The case was ultimately successful in bringing marriage rights back in California, but the Court ruled on procedural grounds, which limited the decision’s scope, and many marriage-equality advocates argued that Boies and Olsen had been too quick to bring the issue before the Court. “In hindsight, Boies and Olson have been vindicated,” the law professor and gay-rights scholar Kenji Yoshino writes in his forthcoming book about the case, “Speak Now,” in that they prepared the Court and the public for subsequent cases.*","189","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"Now the number of states allowing gay marriage is up to thirty-seven. These legal changes have been accompanied by, and are perhaps the results of, accelerating acceptance of gays and lesbians and increasing support for marriage rights. The most recent polling shows that over sixty per cent of Americans now support marriage equality. Evan Wolfson, the founder of the group Freedom to Marry, pointed out to me that “some of the Justices who voted against us” in Windsor did so on the grounds “that there was something so ‘novel’ or ‘untested’ or still ‘in doubt’ ” about gay marriage. That is no longer the case.","190","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"These broad changes in public opinion were on display last week in Indiana and Arkansas, where the business community—not known as a bastion of progressive activism—rallied against laws that would have allowed businesses, based upon their religious beliefs, to refuse service to gay and lesbian customers. Those laws were intended by their sponsors to be a sort of consolation prize to the religious right, which, like everyone else, expects the Supreme Court to rule in favor of a nationwide right to same-sex marriage.","191","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"While no Supreme Court ruling can be considered a forgone conclusion, it seems as though the main suspense about the outcome is how many votes same-sex marriage will garner. In an e-mail this past weekend, Olson told me that he was “heartsick about being on the sidelines as this so very important issue moves to a climax in the Supreme Court.” But he added, “I feel deeply committed to this issue . . . at what I hope and expect to be the finish line.” With respect to the outcome, Olson says, “I wish, like Loving” (meaning Loving v. Virginia, in which the court struck laws against interracial marriage), “it could be 9-0, but I suspect that is not in the cards. I would hope that it would be more than 5-4, as this means so much to this country and our values.”","192","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"
"This is a huge moment for gay Americans. A major civil-rights victory, once thought unimaginable in our lifetime, is likely upon us. As Dustin Lance Black, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of the movie “Milk” and a co-founder of the organization that brought the Prop 8 legal challenge (Black also wrote a play, “8,” about the case) told me, “Growing up in Texas, I learned that the way to earn respect was to treat myself with respect, to stand up for myself. That is exactly what the L.G.B.T. movement started to do again after Prop 8’s passage in California in 2008.” It was also the moment when a backlash against the unfairness of such laws finally started to take hold in America. Six years later, the Supreme Court appears ready to endorse not only same-sex marriage, but full legal equality for all gay Americans.","193","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coming-gay-marriage-ruling"

"It’s a bad day to be Harvey Weinstein’s assistant. That is, a particularly bad day. The Pooh-Bah of Oscar campaigning cannonballed into Broadway this year, as the lead producer of “Finding Neverland,” the over-hyped, over-miked musical adaptation of the 2004 movie. A big fish in a little pond, or at least a moderately sized lake, Weinstein seemed poised to sprinkle the Tony Awards race, Tinkerbell-style, with a dose of bombast. Alas, it won’t be. This morning, when Mary-Louise Parker and Bruce Willis announced the 2015 Tony nominations, the words “Finding Neverland” did not pass their lips. I can’t say I’m heartbroken. For starters: Why tell the story of how J. M. Barrie wrote “Peter Pan” with boy-band power ballads? It’s hard to think of one aesthetic choice that the production got right, down to the wallpaper.","April 28, 2015","235","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-tony-nominations-kings-queens-and-lesbian-cartoonists"

"So who fared better? The full list of nominees is here. Leading the pack are the excellent new musicals “Fun Home” and “An American in Paris,” with twelve nominations apiece. Both will compete for Best Musical, against the divinely silly “Something Rotten!” and Kander and Ebb’s macabre “The Visit.” It’s a robust, eclectic race, even with “Hamilton” waiting in the wings. (Lin-Manuel Miranda’s landmark musical moves to Broadway later this summer; this time next year, it’ll be the show to beat.) Like “Hamilton,” “Fun Home” originated at the Public, which seems to be single-handedly nudging musical theatre toward its future. As Hilton Als writes in this week’s issue, “Fun Home,” based on the cartoonist Alison Bechdel’s heartrending graphic memoir, is an intimate portrait of difference, beautifully staged in the round by Sam Gold, who is nominated for Best Direction of a Musical. It couldn’t be further in tone from “Something Rotten!,” a show-biz romp set in Elizabethan England, in which two hapless rivals to Shakespeare invent musical comedy. A direct descendent of “The Producers” and “Spamalot,” the show is pure, stupid joy. “Fun Home” is pure heartbreak. The Tony voters will have to choose between a very happy apple and a very sad orange.","237","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-tony-nominations-kings-queens-and-lesbian-cartoonists"
"“An American in Paris,” the dance-heavy Gershwin musical derived from the 1951 movie, is technically new, but in spirit it belongs in the Best Revival of a Musical category, a three-way race among “The King and I,” “On the Twentieth Century,” and “On the Town”—which also features three lovesick guys on the prowl. Christopher Wheeldon, who directed “An American in Paris,” is a lock for Best Choreography. Otherwise, Bartlett Sher’s sumptuous production of “The King and I” should clean up some design categories, for its gorgeous Technicolor set (by Michael Yeargan), costumes (Catherine Zuber), and lights (Donald Holder). As for “The Visit,” the Chita Rivera vehicle about a billionairess seeking revenge on her former lover, I can see it winning for Best Original Score—the final collaboration between John Kander and Fred Ebb. (Ebb died in 2004.) But Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron’s score for “Fun Home” has the emotional intricacy and lyrical wit of a Sondheim musical; for a taste of its small-scale radiance, watch this snapshot of sexual awakening.","238","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-tony-nominations-kings-queens-and-lesbian-cartoonists"
"Onto plays. Marianne Elliott’s stunning production of “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,” by Simon Stephens, is my pick for Best Play, though it’s up against a scrappy little upstart: “Hand to God,” Robert Askins’s raunchy comedy about a foul-mouthed hand puppet possessed by the Devil. The other nominees are Ayad Akhtar’s “Disgraced” and the Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Wolf Hall: Parts 1 & 2,” which has the advantage of heft (as did Henry VIII), if not spark. Fall shows are often forgotten by Tony time, but Scott Ellis’s insanely charming production of “You Can’t Take It With You” should top the contenders for Best Play Revival, for which it will compete with “Skylight,” “The Elephant Man,” and “This Is Our Youth.”","239","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-tony-nominations-kings-queens-and-lesbian-cartoonists"
"The acting categories—there are a lot of them—are full of nose-to-nose races. Best Leading Actor in a Play belongs to either Steven Boyer, whose schizoid performance in “Hand to God” is a comic tour-de-force, or Alex Sharp, as the spectrum-y protagonist of “The Curious Incident.” Bradley Cooper did some excellent, contorted work in “The Elephant Man,” but dreamboats playing disabled works better at the Oscars. Speaking of star power, Best Leading Actress in a Play has Helen Mirren (“The Audience”) competing against Carey Mulligan (“Skylight”), along with Elisabeth Moss (“The Heidi Chronicles”). Bet on Mirren, who already won an Oscar for “The Queen” and should try for an EGOT by just playing Queen Elizabeth II. Best Leading Actress in a Musical is an old-fashioned diva showdown: Kelli O’Hara (“The King and I”) versus Kristin Chenoweth (“On the Twentieth Century”). Both are, essentially, pastiche artists; O’Hara, who has never won, is a wholesome nineteen-fifties heroine reincarnated, while Chenoweth is doing nineteen-thirties screwball by way of Madeline Kahn. Best Leading Actor in a Musical should go to Michael Cerveris (“Fun Home”), whose portrayal of Bechdel’s father is a stirring study of a broken soul. He’s up against four worthy charmers: Robert Fairchild (“An American in Paris”), Brian d’Arcy James (“Something Rotten!”), Ken Watanabe (“The King and I”), and Tony Yazbeck (“On the Town”).","240","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-tony-nominations-kings-queens-and-lesbian-cartoonists"
"The featured-actor categories are a smorgasbord of show-stealers, among them Nathaniel Parker, whose Henry VIII is the most entertaining part of “Wolf Hall,” and Brad Oscar, whose erroneous soothsayer is the jewel of “Something Rotten!” Best Featured Actress in a Musical is an impossible choice among three stars of “Fun Home”: the eleven-year-old Sydney Lucas, as little Alison; Emily Skeggs, as college-aged Alison; and Judy Kuhn, as the quietly shattered Mrs. Bechdel. I’d give a slight edge to the one who celebrated her nomination with a headstand.","241","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-tony-nominations-kings-queens-and-lesbian-cartoonists"
"Where’s Neil Patrick Harris in all this? Nowhere, actually. The awards will air on June 7th, hosted by Kristin Chenoweth and Alan Cumming. And Harris has long passed the torch at “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” back to John Cameron Mitchell, who will win a special Tony for the role he originated two decades ago. Other than that, one thing is certain: “second star to the right” will refer not to Neverland but to whoever’s standing next to Helen Mirren.","242","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-tony-nominations-kings-queens-and-lesbian-cartoonists"

"The joke on the critics in “Birdman” has nothing on the one pulled by Peter Bogdanovich in his scintillating 1972 screwball comedy “What’s Up, Doc?” (which I discuss in this clip). The protagonist, Howard Bannister (Ryan O’Neal), a musicologist, is in competition with another scholar for a grant. That competitor, Hugh Simon, is loud and arrogant, flings about ad hominem judgments and recherché references, speaks in a heavy, vaguely Eastern European accent—and makes a reference or two to Yugoslavia (specifically, to Croatia). Watching the film, I figured that Bogdanovich (whose father was Serbian) was having a little fun with the acerbic critic John Simon, born in Subotica—actually a town in Serbia—and that the very casting of the role redoubled the gag. Hugh Simon is played by the comic actor Kenneth Mars, who is best known for his performance in Mel Brooks’s “The Producers” as Franz Liebkind, the Nazi-fanboy who wrote “Springtime for Hitler.” Turns out that I was right; here’s Bogdanovich—along with Brooks—talking with Dick Cavett , in January, 1972, about the portrayal. It’s in keeping with the tone and the import of the film.","April 22, 2015","250","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-whats-up-doc"
"Bogdanovich made a screwball comedy in retro-style—the style of Howard Hawks—and added the colossal catastrophe comedy of silent films and of such moderns as Frank Tashlin and Blake Edwards. Bogdanovich had made “The Last Picture Show” and was about to make “Paper Moon.” He was in full-retro mode, but he was no nostalgist. He borrowed genres and tones from the past because that past seemed, to him, neither dead nor past. Classic-Hollywood mythology remained in full force even as the studios seemed to be dying (that’s the subject that gets the on-air conversation started)—and even as the culture seemed to be shifting decisively away from Hollywood’s rigid formats and genres and away from the societal rigidities and exclusions that they reflected. These legends exerted an enduring force as personal experience, as masks of inner identities—including his own. Individuals were, and are, haunted by Hollywood, and Bogdanovich conjured its spirits. He continues to do so; his new film, “She’s Funny That Way”—scheduled for release in August—is anchored by allusions to Ernst Lubitsch’s 1946 comedy “Cluny Brown.”","251","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-whats-up-doc"

"When Barack Obama took office, in 2009, he had a long agenda—mending a collapsing economy, transforming health care, and ending two wars, to name just the top items. Nominating judges to the federal judiciary was low on the list. The President filled two quick vacancies on the Supreme Court with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. As for the dozens of vacancies on the federal circuit and district courts, Obama’s attention was fleeting. He didn’t even submit nominees to fill many judicial vacancies, including on the D.C. Circuit, which is generally regarded as the second most important court in the country. (I interviewed Reid and the President about their impact on the federal judiciary last year.)","269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"

"When Republicans took control of the House of Representatives after the 2010 elections, the President’s chances for pushing through meaningful legislation vanished. But the Senate, which is responsible for confirming judges, remained in Democratic hands—and in 2013, Reid took charge of the issue. The Senate had confirmed only five Obama appointees to the federal appeals court in the election year of 2012, but Reid moved to double the pace in 2013. Republicans responded by filibustering almost every judicial appointment to the appeals court and slow-walking appointments to the district court, which had been routine and uncontroversial under earlier Presidents. Reid fought back, and kept pushing the President’s nominees. In time, though, Reid came to a crossroads.","271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"
"Reid had fifty-five Democrats in the Senate—enough for a majority but not enough to beat back Republican filibusters. So, in December, 2013, Reid invoked what became known as the nuclear option. With Reid’s blessing, Senate Democrats changed the rules so that only a majority would be required to move lower-court judgeships to a vote. Freed from the threat of filibusters, Reid pushed through thirteen appeals-court judges in 2013 and 2014, a group of exceptional quality. They included Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and Robert Wilkins on the D.C. Circuit. For the first time in decades, that court now has a majority of Democratic appointees. Other confirmations included such luminaries as Pamela Harris (a noted professor and advocate) on the Fourth Circuit, Jill Pryor on the Eleventh, and David Barron (a Harvard law professor and Obama Administration lawyer) on the First. None received more than sixty votes, meaning that they would not have been confirmed had Reid not changed the rules. In future decades, many of these judges will be candidates for promotion if a Democratic President has a Supreme Court vacancy to fill. At the same time, Reid pushed through more than a hundred district-court judges in his last two years as Majority Leader. Of course, almost all of these judges will serve long after Barack Obama and Harry Reid have left office.","272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"
"Through the Reagan and two Bush Presidencies, Republicans worked hard to put a conservative stamp on the federal judiciary. Under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the subject never received the same attention. But Reid saw the importance of federal judges—which is especially apparent now, as the fate of the Affordable Care Act and the President’s immigration initiatives come before the courts. Congress is famous now mostly for its dysfunction, but as Reid has shown the Senate can be made to work. With focus, passion, and relentless attention to the goal before him, he remade the federal judiciary. This living monument to the Democratic leader will stand long after he retires next year.","273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-harry-reid-changed-the-federal-courts"

"OBAMACARE: The Supreme Court has now heard argument in King v. Burwell, which may be the most consequential case to come before the Justices since Bush v. Gore.

Most of the plan was supposed to go into effect on February 18th, but twenty-six states filed a challenge before Judge Andrew Hanen, of the federal district court in Brownsville, Texas, a noted critic of the President’s immigration policies. Hanen issued an injunction stopping the program before it started, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (which is similarly hostile to Obama) has so far declined to lift the injunction. A hearing before the appellate court is not even scheduled until April 17th, and more delays, if not the outright defeat of Obama’s initiative, are likely to follow.","281","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"

"Of course, all Administrations see some of their initiatives challenged in court. The Supreme Court repeatedly rejected George W. Bush’s attempts to limit the legal rights of detainees in Guantanámo Bay. But the number and scope of the legal threats to Obama appear unprecedented. This comes in part because, these days, the extreme polarization of political opinion in Congress is reflected in the federal courts as well. On the Supreme Court and on lower courts, the differences between conservative and liberal federal judges can lead to dramatic differences in results. Sometimes, it’s worth it for challengers to roll the dice in front of the right judge.","284","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"
"When I interviewed President Obama about legal matters, last year, he made another point about why litigation has become so important in contemporary Washington. He noted that there was once a time when Congress actually did pass laws to address national problems. Legislators enacted a major reform of immigration laws in 1986 and a significant addition to the Clean Air Act in 1990. But Congress has been paralyzed by partisan gridlock in recent years; its inability, or unwillingness, to address immigration is only the best known of its failures. When Congress doesn’t act, the underlying problems don’t go away—and a President will try to address them on his own. This leads to lawsuits in response. And now there are lots of them, and their verdicts will pass judgment on President Obama as much as on any individual issue.","285","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-threat-to-obama-from-the-courts"

"Brian Williams, the NBC news anchor, is taking himself off the air for what he says will be “several days.” He presumably hopes that the media firestorm surrounding claims he made about his reporting experience in Iraq will subside. He will probably be able to hang on—just as the Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino did. (I’m reminded of Marino because he just appeared on my TV screen as a pitchman for Nutrisystem.) In January, 2013, it was revealed that he had fathered a child out of wedlock with a CBS production assistant and had reportedly paid her millions of dollars, in part so that his wife and six kids would not hear of it. Marino kept his sportscaster job at CBS. While Brian Williams is caught in a different calibre of scandal, it is safe to say that he will treat his time away from the news desk as a period of reflection. He will almost certainly cancel his scheduled appearance on CBS’s “Late Show with David Letterman” this week. And, if captured by cameras, he will likely appear sombre. But anyone capable of a long view knows there are often second—and third—acts in American public life.","February 8, 2015","303","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-god-complex"
"However, there are some scenarios in which he does not survive as an NBC anchor. One: if more fabrications surface from the work of hundreds, probably thousands, of amateur detectives online—eager to prove that Williams was not telling the truth when he claimed, for instance, that he saw a body floating beneath his hotel window in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. NBC’s probe by its own sleuth, the investigations producer Richard Esposito, could also unearth more headline-making material. Senior NBC executives fear that Williams will fail to better explain what he did, and why his explanation last Wednesday on air was more spin than the truth to his audience. And, if Williams does comes back to the anchor, chair and his Nielsen ratings plummet, his NBC bosses will have more reason to decide, as management did with Dan Rather on CBS a decade ago, that his image in the minds of too many viewers has been irrevocably damaged.","304","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-god-complex"
"But, while the spotlight is on Williams’s transgressions, a word about the complicity of NBC and the other networks’ marketing machines: The networks have a stake in promoting their anchors as God-like figures. By showing them in war zones, with Obama or Putin, buffeted by hurricanes, and comforting victims, they are telling viewers that their anchors are truth-tellers who have been everywhere and seen everything and have experience you can trust. On his helicopter in Iraq, Williams was accompanied by an NBC crew. Did they not speak up to correct the record for fear of undermining the powerful anchor? NBC had a stake in promoting Brian Williams as all-knowing, just as a promo ad for the ABC anchor David Muir that I saw today portrayed the lightly experienced forty-year-old as worldly. Brian Williams has valuable experience reporting from the White House, but, unlike ABC’s Peter Jennings, or Dan Rather, for “60 Minutes,” he has never been a correspondent overseas. (Anchoring a broadcast from Baghdad or Moscow is not comparable.)","305","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-god-complex"
"In addition to the marketing campaigns, something else happens that often induces anchors to think of themselves as God. Each of them is seen in roughly eight to ten million homes nightly. They are seen by many more people, and more frequently, than any movie star. To walk down a street with an anchor is to be stunned both by how many people recognize him and how many viewers call out to him about specific stories. There’s a respectful familiarity that is different from the awe surrounding Hollywood celebrities. The anchor is treated as the citizen’s trusted guide to the news. As a result, he can feel expected to dominate discussions, to tell war stories, to play God. It’s a short distance from there to telling fantastic stories—and maybe actually believing them.","306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-god-complex"
"In the mid-nineteen-nineties, Charles Grodin retired from acting and withdrew to Connecticut, to spend more time with his wife, Elissa, his young son, and a collection of life-size fibreglass animals—including a buffalo—that he installed in his back yard. He wrote books filled with lightly curmudgeonly anecdotes and began recording one-minute syndicated commentaries, about this and that, for CBS Radio, sometimes ending with the words “Oh, boy.”","307","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"But, a few years ago, when Grodin was in his mid-seventies, he began to act again: demand for his representations of pained, wincing men somehow overpowered his wish never to leave Wilton. For example, Grodin played a recurring character—an unsolicitous, if insightful, doctor—in the fourth season of “Louie.”","308","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"At eleven-thirty on a recent morning, Grodin was not far from his home, in the Red Barn restaurant, in the shadow of the Merritt Parkway. Staff members greeted him as “Mr. G.”; the hits of the Carpenters, including “Top of the World,” played on the sound system. Grodin—baseball cap, zip-up corduroy jacket, wan smile—said that he hadn’t been out to the movies in fifteen years. When he is offered work, “I never say, ‘How much?’ I say, ‘Where?’ ” He praised Louis C.K. for getting him home at a reasonable hour. Grodin then described his first day on “While We’re Young,” Noah Baumbach’s new comedy, in which he plays Ben Stiller’s father-in-law. Baumbach spent perhaps two hours shooting a brief scene in which Grodin has his bow tie adjusted by Naomi Watts. Quoting a remark made by the actor Joe Bologna during a visit to the Universal Studios theme park, Grodin asked Baumbach, “Who do you have to fuck to get off this tour?”","309","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"Grodin ordered a turkey club sandwich and described his garden animals. “I’m kind of on hold for a cow right now,” he said. He started his collection after a visit to United House Wrecking, in Stamford. “I decided—I don’t know why—that I was going to get a number of these. My wife looked at me. She calls it Chuck’s World.”","310","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"He went on, “That’s O.K., but then I wired them for sound. And it wasn’t the sound of a horse or a buffalo or an elephant or a dog—it was me doing different dialects. Like the buffalo has a Yiddish dialect. And the elephant is an upper-class English.” Impersonating his elephant, he said, “ ‘Have you been talking to Bob the buffalo?’ ” Each animal has only one short recorded speech. The loudspeakers are hidden in the undergrowth. Referring to the over-all effect, Grodin said, “It’s a good idea. I activate them with a remote control from a golf cart. I wouldn’t do it for myself; you’d only do it for somebody who’s never heard it. Here’s the horse: he goes, ‘Mr. Ed, Francis the Talking Mule, and I all studied with Strasberg. Fran is actually a talking horse, but he calls himself a talking mule. That’s his humor. Go figure.’ ” Grodin claimed that even the elephant is full-size, but then thought for a moment: “Well, I’m sure there are bigger elephants.”","311","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"Grodin, widely admired for his disobliging performances on late-night talk shows, once had dinner with Johnny Carson, who asked if he’d join him on an African safari. “He was serious. I have a place in Manhattan—I barely go there. I said, ‘Being in a tent with wild animals trying to get in at us?’ ” Grodin told Carson, on the air, about growing up within earshot of the Pittsburgh Zoo: Grodin would lie in bed, tell himself a joke, and wait for the hyenas to laugh. “Elissa saw that, and got an assignment from American Film to interview me, and within thirty minutes of the tape recorder being on I asked her to shut it off, and at the end of the next thirty minutes I was discussing marriage with her, and now we’ve been married thirty-three years.”","312","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"His wife had asked him to buy something for her printer. He also needed corduroy pants. After leaving the Red Barn—“So long, Mr. G.”—Grodin drove to a mall in Norwalk. In the car, he recalled that Cybill Shepherd, his co-star in “The Heartbreak Kid,” had mentioned in a memoir that they had once slept together. “I said, ‘Why would you put that in a book?’ She said, ‘You should be grateful I included you.’ ”","313","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"
"The men’s section in Marshalls disappointed him. “This is all lightweight,” Grodin said. “I don’t see anything flannel.” Walking across to Staples, he described his exercise regimen: “I used to have a treadmill that I would look at.” A young woman was wearing a red Staples uniform and a red Staples name tag. “You work here, right?” he asked her, and she laughed and pointed the way to the ink-and-toner wall. ♦","314","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/fibreglass-menagerie"

"Since you can’t make this stuff up, I won’t bother trying. Instead, a quick recap:","January 30, 2015","322","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Early today, my editor e-mailed to ask if I’d write about Mitt Romney’s upcoming announcement. The e-mail contained a link to a story from Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin, which said that Romney was planning to hold an 11 A.M. conference call with some financial donors, to “update” them on his thoughts about running for President a third time.","323","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Halperin wisely avoided reaching a definitive conclusion on whether Romney was going to confirm his entry to the 2016 contest. He did suggest, however, that this was the likeliest reason for the conference call: “Based on all the conversations I have had with Romney World this week, I would bet that Mitt and Ann Romney’s proposition, that if he runs he will become the Republican nominee, is about to be tested.”","324","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"","325","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"By the time I’d had breakfast and subjected my Twitter followers to a few thoughts about the new G.D.P. figures, the online mulching machine had converted Halperin’s qualified wager into a general consensus that Romney was all in. The Daily Beast, evidently convinced that it had the inside track, published a story headlined “Romney Will Run For President,” which it tweeted out with an “EXCLUSIVE” label.","326","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"The Daily Beast story was picked up everywhere, and as eleven o’clock approached, the tension was palpable. (O.K., I made up that last bit.) What, exactly, would Romney say? On January 9th, he had said—to another group of donors, of course—“I want to be President.” A few days after that appearance, the Washington Post reported that he was “almost certain” to enter the race. Just this past Wednesday, talking at Mississippi State University, he took a jab at Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, noting, “How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn’t know where the jobs come from in the first place?”","327","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Reading all of this, it would be just about possible to imagine, if you tried hard enough—or if you were a Republican political operative looking for another well-paid gig—that the idea of Romney entering the G.O.P. race and winning the nomination for a second time was a realistic proposition rather than a fantasy.","328","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"To take this position, you would have had to convince yourself that New Romney would be able to live down his “forty-seven per cent” comment and the fourteen-per-cent tax rate he paid in 2011; that Jeb Bush hadn’t already occupied the role of wise establishment elder; and that it was of no consequence that many influential people connected with the Republican Party regard Romney as an out-of-touch loser, whose presence on the ticket would guarantee the Democrats another victory in 2016. (Rupert Murdoch, in describing Romney a few weeks ago as “a terrible candidate,” was only voicing publicly what many other Republicans were saying privately. Just this week, David Kochel, one of Romney’s key operatives in 2012, joined Bush’s political-action committee.)","329","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Romney, during his long and successful business career, wasn’t known for flights of fancy. These days, though, he’s a semi-retired but still ambitious politician. Perhaps he had convinced himself to give us wretches in the press corps what we so badly wanted: a Mitt–Jeb showdown.","330","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Alas, it was not to be. About ten minutes before eleven, Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio presenter, posted on his Web site the very remarks that Romney was about to deliver. They began with a few sentences of thanks for the people around the country who had encouraged him to run. Then came the lede: “After putting considerable thought into making another run for president, I’ve decided it is best to give other leaders in the Party the opportunity to become our next nominee.”","331","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"So that was that, then? Not quite. In fact, Romney’s statement went on for another eight paragraphs. After citing a poll showing him leading the other putative G.O.P. contenders by nearly two to one, the statement said, “So I am convinced that we could win the nomination.” It went on, “I also believe . . . I would have the best chance of beating the eventual Democrat nominee.”","332","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Why, then, wasn’t he running? Because it was time to make way for the young—or for the younger, anyway: “I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders, one who may not be as well known as I am today, one who has not yet taken their message across the country, one who is just getting started, may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee. In fact, I expect and hope that to be the case.”","333","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"If you interpret that paragraph as a parting shot at Jeb, who is already in his sixties, you weren’t the only one. With several minutes still left until Romney was due to speak, the Twitter hordes, myself included, were already busy parsing the text and handicapping the remaining G.O.P. field, which, despite the sad departure of the Mittster, appears to be growing by the day. Mostly, though, we were trying to make jokes at Romney’s expense.","334","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Eric Boehlert, of Media Matters, tweeted, “Team Mitt: the US is dangerously off course. US under attack around the globe and US economy cratering…but Mitt doesn’t feel like running.” The political analyst Jeff Greenfield offered, “So Romney’s not running; this really opens the door for George Pataki….” And, from John Podhoretz, of the New York Post: “Mitt Romney could also have won the Super Bowl but he decided to let other, younger people deflate the balls.”","335","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"In fact, Romney made the only sensible decision, for both himself and his party.","336","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"On a personal level, Romney’s chance of becoming President came and went in 2012; running again would merely have subjected him to more torment. From the Republican Party’s perspective, the 2016 race is already shaping up to be another extended exercise in the art of drilling a circular firing squad. Adding a Romney-versus-Bush element to the emerging narrative would have benefited only the media and the Democrats. On Thursday, we learned, via a leak to Politico’s Mike Allen, that Hillary Clinton is considering waiting until July to announce her candidacy. That’s smart. With little serious opposition on the Democratic side, why not sit back for a while, and join the peanut gallery watching the Republicans go at each other?","337","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"In the end, evidently, Romney came to his senses and accepted all of this. And so the 2016 race will go on without him.","338","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"If you’ve been following recent political news, you’ve probably seen stories about senior Republicans acknowledging that it’s time, finally, for the Party to confront the issues of rising inequality and income stagnation. Speaking in Detroit last month, Jeb Bush said, “Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin, and many more feel like they’re stuck in place, working longer and harder, even as they’re losing ground.” According to numerous reports, Bush is now working toward an economic plan, in anticipation of his expected run for the G.O.P. Presidential nomination, that would tackle some of these issues.","March 26, 2015","339","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"","340","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"In certain Republican quarters, there is even talk of the Party downplaying its commitment to trickle-down economics: the old mantra of cutting taxes, primarily on the rich. “Bush and any other Republican running needs to do a better job … of talking about economic issues in a very different way than Republicans have in the past,” Tony Fratto, a deputy press secretary in George W. Bush’s Administration, told Politico’s Ben White. “If you go to Americans and ask them what their greatest fears are, they won’t say it’s that their taxes are too high. They will talk about things like technology removing the need for hands-on workers and their children not receiving the skills and education to allow them to compete in the global economy.”","341","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"A few Republicans have put forth some actual proposals to address inequality, such as Senator Marco Rubio’s idea to convert the earned-income tax credit, one of the few redistributive programs that enjoys bipartisan support, into a universal subsidy for low-wage workers. One of the shortcomings of the earned-income credit is that it is targeted to low-income families; low-paid workers who don’t have children receive much smaller credits. Rubio’s reform could conceivably address this problem. But still, whenever I hear talk that the Republicans intend to tackle inequality, I can’t help thinking of Deep Throat’s adage: follow the money.","342","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"As E. J. Dionne, Jr., has pointed out, in the journal Democracy, Rubio’s wage-subsidy proposal would be far more interesting if the senator would explain how he would pay for it without hurting the current beneficiaries of the earned-income tax credit. More broadly, it is difficult to take seriously the idea that the Republican Party is changing its ways when its elected officials are simultaneously seeking to bestow more tax cuts on the richest of the rich and slash programs aimed at the poor and the middle class.","343","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"On Wednesday, the G.O.P.-dominated House Ways and Means Committee voted to repeal the federal estate tax, which Republicans have, for years, been labelling a “death tax” that ravages the bequests of ordinary Americans. “This tax doesn’t just hit the big guy,” the committee’s chairman, Paul Ryan, said. “It hits the little guy—like the small business and the family farm.”","344","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"The facts? Since George W. Bush entered office, in 2001, the estate tax has already been reformed several times, and it now applies only to inheritances valued at more than $5.4 million. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, about 0.2 per cent of estates—that’s two in a thousand, or fewer than four thousand estates in total—owed the estate tax. As Congressman Jim McDermott, a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee, pointed out, “You cannot call twenty-three-thousand acres a family farm.” A repeal of the estate tax, he said, would amount to a “massive unfunded tax break” for the very wealthiest people in the country. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the move will raise the budget deficit by about two hundred and seventy billion dollars over the next ten years.","345","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"On the same day that this attempted exercise in upward income redistribution was going on in Ryan’s committee, just down the hall, in the main chamber of the House, Republican representatives were approving a new budget that, according to its primary sponsor, Tom Price, the chairman of the Budget Committee, would balance the budget within ten years, primarily by cutting expenditures by nearly $5.5 trillion, as compared with the projected costs of current policies. Who would be most hurt by those spending reductions? You guessed it.","346","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"An analysis by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that more than two-thirds of the proposed spending cuts would come from programs that serve low-income and middle-income Americans. Almost three trillion dollars (yes, trillion) would be saved by repealing Obamacare, which provides income-based subsidies for the purchase of private insurance plans, and by slashing funding for Medicaid, the federal health-care system for the poor, which would be converted to a block-grant program and handed over to the states. The Price budget would also cut spending on food stamps by more than a third between 2021 and 2025. It would allow some existing tax credits for low-income and middle-income families to expire over the next few years. And it would significantly reduce funding for Pell Grants, which help students from families of modest means to afford college.","347","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"
"In one sense, of course, none of this congressional maneuvering matters. As long as a Democrat occupies the White House, there’s practically no chance that G.O.P. spending cuts will be enacted, marking the Price budget as more of a political wish list than an actual funding bill. But wish lists matter, too, especially for a Party that is supposedly trying to change its public image. And in 2015, it seems, the most that the Republicans can hope for is to shower more gifts on the wealthiest households in America, while depriving poor families of health care, food stamps, and college tuition.","348","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-the-g-o-p-promises-to-address-inequality-follow-the-money"

"One of the ironies of the Republican takeover of the Senate is that it has made President Barack Obama more of a central player in Washington’s legislative debates than he had been before. In the last Congress, when the House was under Republican control and Democrats ran the Senate, the House Republicans easily passed dozens of bills on party-line votes that were then ignored by the Senate. When the Senate occasionally mustered the ability to advance legislation, the House repaid the favor. Obama was often a bystander as the two chambers produced gridlock.","January 9, 2015","359","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Obama learned that publicly campaigning for the few bills that did have some life, like comprehensive immigration reform, actually made them less likely to pass. At one point during the immigration debate, Democratic senators begged Obama not to make a high-profile speech on the issue. And so, increasingly, he remained publicly absent from the negotiations.

"The lines of authority are a little clearer now, even if John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, have the continuing challenge of dealing with their right flanks. They also have a strong incentive to work together to move legislation: going into 2016, they want to show that the G.O.P. is unified and capable of governing. But after those bills pass both chambers, they will reach Obama’s desk. Obama and his veto have replaced Harry Reid, who has now been reduced to the role of minority leader, as the crucial blocking tool for Democrats.","362","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"The first test of whether this new dynamic will lead to a more productive Congress comes this week, with the debate over Keystone XL, the Canadian pipeline project that has been mired in political controversy for six years. Republicans in both the House and Senate declared that approving Keystone XL, which would carry oil from Alberta, Canada, to U.S. refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, would be their first order of business, and the House approved its version of the legislation on Friday afternoon.","363","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"At first glance, it’s absurd that approval of a Canadian corporation’s pipeline project is the new Republican Congress’s highest priority. The benefit to the U.S. economy from the construction of the pipeline would be modest—a few thousand temporary jobs created during its construction and a few dozen permanent jobs once it’s up and running. Republicans have long argued that the pipeline would help reduce fuel prices, a tenuous claim that is now beside the point because the price of a gallon of gas is at a five-year low.","364","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Still, there is a scenario in which Boehner and McConnell’s decision to start with Keystone might be encouraging. The Obama Administration immediately announced that the President would veto the legislation. But the veto statement was silent on the merits of the project itself. Obama simply objected to Congress interfering with the pipeline-approval process, which has historically been left to the executive branch. The President’s exclusive right to approve cross-border pipelines may be such a fundamental principle to the Administration that the veto statement is the beginning and end of the debate. (Republicans don’t have the necessary sixty-seven votes to overturn an Obama veto.)","365","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"But what if the White House saw the fight over Keystone as an opportunity for a larger deal? Keystone XL is one of the few G.O.P. priorities in which the philosophical gulf between Obama and congressional Republicans is relatively narrow. In private, Obama has been dismissive of environmentalist claims that building Keystone XL would significantly affect climate change, and his State Department, with some caveats, came to the same conclusion in an environmental-impact statement. In U.S. and Canadian diplomatic circles, officials regularly discuss whether there could be some kind of a deal between the two countries. For example, Canada might make a more ambitious pledge to reduce carbon pollution in return for U.S. approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.","366","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"So why doesn’t Obama have that discussion with Congress instead? What would the G.O.P. be willing to trade to get Keystone approved? A carbon tax? A large infrastructure project? Codifying the E.P.A.’s climate regulations into law? From the White House’s perspective, the Keystone XL pipeline should be an ideal policy to give away in a trade: it’s a major issue that Republicans care a great deal about but one that Obama seems to view as a sideshow. (And if world oil prices remain low, Keystone may be entirely moot because production in the expensive-to-develop Canadian oil sands might not be economically viable.)","367","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Obama’s final decision on the matter is fast approaching. The last major bureaucratic step is a State Department review of the “national interest” in the project, which had been postponed while a Nebraska court considered a challenge to the route of the pipeline through that state. On Friday, the court ratified that route, clearing the way for the State Department to complete its work. It is possible, and perhaps even more likely than not, that soon after Obama vetoed congressional legislation forcing approval of Keystone XL he would then approve the project on his own. But will he get anything in return? If the Republican Congress and President Obama can’t figure out a way to cut a deal on this issue, don’t expect the next two years to look much different from the last two.","368","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/keystone-xl-test-can-obama-make-deal"
"Like the show itself, the title of the New Museum’s rousing triennial, “Surround Audience,” succeeds on a few different levels. On the one hand, it’s ominous, as if the fifty-one early-career artists and collectives had a mandate to ambush or quarantine viewers and keep them under surveillance. It also suggests a benign enveloping—the group-show equivalent of a Snuggie. The phrase is the brainchild of Ryan Trecartin, who drew raves as a fully formed star for the digital age during the museum’s first triennial of emerging artists, “Younger Than Jesus,” in 2009.

"The Western is the political genre par excellence, and it has often been infused with political substance that belongs less to the era of the Wild West than to the time of filming. That’s certainly the case with Allan Dwan’s 1954 Western “Silver Lode” (which I discuss in this clip), a small-scale masterwork of paranoia and federalism that presses some of the hot buttons of Dwan’s own time. But Dwan’s time was pretty long—he was born in 1885, and died in 1981—and his vision of the West digs through the issues to the underlying ideas, and even to a surprisingly philosophical contemplation of the social order. What makes him a cinematic artist of the first order is the inseparability of his style and his substance; his images alone would suffice to bring out his distinctive range of thought. Thinking in pictures is one of the very definitions of cinema, and one of the great advances in critical thought, in the past half century or so, is the recognition that these sophisticated and personal visual notions can come to life by way of often overlooked commercial productions (such as the low-budget ones that occupied much of Dwan’s career). Nobody, in his heyday, would have taken Dwan for a boldly original artist; nobody today should take him for anything less.","March 4, 2015","386","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-silver-lode"
"At a press conference two years ago this week, President Obama expressed his frustration with the “conventional wisdom” about the refusal of Congressional Republicans to accept his offer to avert eighty-five billion dollars’ worth of automatic sequestration spending cuts. “Even though most people agree that I’m being reasonable, that most people agree I’m presenting a fair deal,” the President said, “the fact that they don’t take it means that I should somehow, you know, do a Jedi mind meld with these folks and convince them to do what’s right.”","March 3, 2015","387","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"

"It’s Vulcans, of course, who do mind melds; Jedi perform “mind tricks.” Obama had committed the cardinal sin of confusing two space franchises. (As William Shatner said in mock horror at the American Film Institute’s tribute to George Lucas, when he “realized” that he wasn’t addressing a “Star Trek” convention, “Star Wars?”) Trekkies took to Twitter at warp speed, and the furor was put to rest only when the galaxy’s leading expert on the topic, Leonard Nimoy, tweeted, “Only a Vulcan mind meld will help with this congress.”","389","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"The gaffe was quickly forgiven. Obama was a self-proclaimed “Star Trek” fan; at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles, in 2007, he had spotted Nimoy across the room—their first contact—and flashed him the Vulcan salute. Nimoy wrote in his memoir that “Spock was a character whose time had come. He represented a practical, reasoning voice in a period of dissension and chaos.” (The actor apparently saw similar qualities in the President.) Obama was frequently likened to Spock—even, slyly, by Obama himself. Eulogizing Nimoy, who died last week, Obama spoke admiringly of the character, whom he described as “cool, logical, big-eared, and level-headed.” He added, “I loved Spock.”","390","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"Nimoy was also a lifelong liberal. Born in Boston, he decided to be an actor at the age of seventeen, after appearing in a local production of “Awake and Sing!,” Clifford Odets’s gritty Depression-era drama. Odets’s portrayal of a “young man surrounded by a hostile and repressive environment” had, Nimoy recalled, “so touched a responsive chord that I decided to make a career of acting.” He struggled in the profession at the start, but decided to stick with it when, working as a cab driver in Los Angeles, he picked up a young Senator John F. Kennedy and drove him to the airport. The competition was unrelenting for both politicians and entertainers, Kennedy said, but he assured him, “Just remember: there’s always room for one more good one.”","391","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"Once Nimoy became famous, as Spock, he used his celebrity to promote political causes. He spoke at anti-Vietnam War rallies (as did the other Spock, Benjamin). In 1968, the teen magazine FaVE! published a letter addressed to Spock from a girl who was the offspring of a biracial marriage—as was Spock (and as is Obama)—asking for advice on coping with racism. Nimoy was moved to write a response, headlined “Spock: Teenage Outcast.” “Spock learned he could save himself from letting prejudice get him down,” Nimoy wrote. “He could do this by really being himself and knowing his own value as a person.”","392","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"In 1972, Nimoy stumped nationwide for George McGovern. (In gratitude, McGovern read some of Nimoy’s poetry into the Congressional Record.) Asked whether it was appropriate for an actor to make political speeches, Nimoy said, “Well, I think it’s about as fair as Ronald Reagan running for governor of California based on the fact that he’s done some movies.” Every four years, “Spock for President” bumper stickers appeared on cars across the country. Nimoy even sang a spirited version of the Pete Seeger classic “If I Had a Hammer,” which appeared on his albums “The Way I Feel” and “Highly Illogical.” In 2012, he narrated a fake convention bio-pic, “Mitt Romney: A Human Who Built That,” for “The Daily Show.”","393","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"Obama wasn’t the only politician to mourn Nimoy’s passing. Justin Trudeau, the leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, tweeted a picture of himself making the Vulcan salute, adding, “For us Trekkies he was—and always shall be—our friend. #LLAP.” (The Canadian Design Resource issued a call for citizens to “Spock your fives,” an ongoing, informal art project in which Canadians add Spock’s ears, hair, and eyebrows to the portrait of the former Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier on the five-dollar bill.)","394","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"
"Elsewhere on the political spectrum, Bill Post, a former conservative radio host who won a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives last year and who calls himself “the biggest ‘Star Trek’ fan in the Oregon Legislature,” said that Spock was the “greatest Republican in the history of the galaxy,” adding, “he was a legal alien who believed in prosperity.” It is true that Nimoy lived long and prospered. Still, it is doubtful that either Nimoy, a former sergeant in the United States Army, or Spock, a Starfleet commander of the United Federation of Planets, would have approved of last week’s Republican gambit to deport millions of undocumented immigrants by threatening to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. The attempt collapsed Friday, a few hours after Nimoy died. The funding issue will be taken up again this week, but Spock, as usual, was correct: it may take something like a Vulcan mind meld to sort this Congress out.","395","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-political-mr-spock"

"We are in the year of the dwarf planet. NASA’s Dawn space probe has just taken up a yearlong orbital residence at Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, and this summer the agency’s New Horizons mission will fly past Pluto, one of the largest objects in the Kuiper Belt, a sparse disc of icy chunks out beyond Neptune. We have never seen a dwarf planet up close before; their nature and origin are still poorly understood. Nobody knows, for instance, what the two closely spaced bright spots on Ceres, which resemble a pair of headlights, could be. And nobody knows much at all about Pluto. “It could have ice geysers or ice volcanoes,” Alan Stern, the lead scientist for New Horizons, told me recently. “It could have a subterranean ocean. It’s anybody’s guess at this point.”","March 6, 2015","397","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/nasa-dawn-ceres-pluto-dwarf-planets"
"Whatever the probes find, it probably won’t help untangle the tortuous reasoning that led to Pluto and Ceres being labelled as dwarf planets in the first place. That happened in 2006, a few months after New Horizons launched and about a year before Dawn did, at a meeting of the International Astronomical Union, the organization that is in charge of classifying and naming celestial objects. The I.A.U. defines a dwarf planet according to four criteria: it must orbit the sun, it must be spherical, it must not be a satellite of another planet, and it must not have “cleared the neighborhood” of other objects of comparable size.","398","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/nasa-dawn-ceres-pluto-dwarf-planets"

"Ceres has a diameter of fewer than six hundred miles, Pluto of about fourteen hundred miles. By comparison, Mercury, now the smallest official planet in our solar system, is more than three thousand miles across. So it’s not unreasonable, Stern says, to call Pluto both a planet and a dwarf, provided that one doesn’t cancel out the other. “I’m the one who originally coined the term ‘dwarf planet,’ back in the nineteen-nineties,” he told me. “I’m fine with it. But saying a dwarf planet isn’t a planet is like saying a pygmy hippopotamus isn’t a hippopotamus. It’s scientifically indefensible.”","400","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/nasa-dawn-ceres-pluto-dwarf-planets"
"Why, then, did the I.A.U. demote Pluto? As David Spergel, the head of the astrophysics department at Princeton University, explained to me, once scientists discovered the Kuiper Belt, which includes several Pluto look-alikes, and once they discovered Eris, a dead ringer for Pluto, the organization became worried about a slippery slope. If Pluto was a planet, Eris would have to be, too, along with any number of Kuiper Belt objects. Things risked getting out of hand. Fifteen or twenty or fifty planets was too many—who would be able to remember them all? That last question may sound absurd, but in a debate held last year at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Gareth Williams, the astronomer representing the I.A.U.’s position, couldn’t come up with a better argument. “You’d need a mnemonic to remember the mnemonic,” he said. “We really want to keep the number of planets low.” He lost the debate on the merits, but the demotion had already been won.","401","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/nasa-dawn-ceres-pluto-dwarf-planets"
"The degradation of Pluto distressed scientists and non-scientists alike. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s book on the episode, “The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America’s Favorite Planet,” sold briskly (although so did “How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming,” by Mike Brown, the Caltech astronomer who first spotted Eris). There wasn’t any controversy, however, over the I.A.U.’s classifying Ceres as a dwarf planet. Though considered a full-fledged planet when it was discovered, in 1801, it was soon grouped with the asteroids. The 2006 decision, then, was effectively a promotion.","402","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/nasa-dawn-ceres-pluto-dwarf-planets"
"It makes no practical difference, of course, what we call Pluto and Ceres, just as it makes no practical difference whether Australia is the biggest island or the smallest continent. Both are believed to be leftovers of a population of thousands of smallish, roundish objects that mostly collected together to form larger ones—Mars, Jupiter, Earth, and the rest. Examining them up close and in detail will tell planetary scientists about what the solar system looked like more than four billion years ago. It’s as though a couple of Neanderthals had survived to the present, long after their fellows had been absorbed into our own population. We might get into an argument about precisely who and what they were, but we wouldn’t forget what they could teach us about ourselves.","403","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/nasa-dawn-ceres-pluto-dwarf-planets"

And there are hundreds of pale-faced youths, exactly alike, who have forced the debutante to acquire a line of patter that will apply with equal appropriateness to all the numberless, colorless young men whom she once had the misfortune to meet, and with whom, if they so choose, she must continue to dance at every party.

What does it matter if an unsavory Irish politician is carrying on a dull and noisy flirtation with the little blonde at the table behind us? We don’t have to listen; we are with people whose conversation we find amusing. What does it matter if the flapper and her fattish boy friend are wriggling beside us as we dance?

"Apple-picking season has been over in most of the United States since November. The trees are bare and dormant, and the orchard workers have set about their cold-weather pruning. Pyramids of Red Delicious, Pink Lady, Gala, and Fuji that are destined for the grocery store have been living in modified-atmosphere storage warehouses for months, and will soon be joined by fresh reinforcements from the Southern Hemisphere. But, even in this winter lull, the question on growers’ minds is the same as it has been since Robert Frost pointed his ladder heavenward and Winslow Homer painted his young pickers in sunbonnets: How can you tell when an apple is ripe?","January 15, 2015","414","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/laser-judge-apple-ripeness"
"The human mouth, that multifunctional organ of sensory perception, is a first-rate ripeness detector, but it delivers its verdict only after an apple has been picked, purchased, and, for all practical purposes, despoiled. Even the most skilled appraiser can’t be truly sure that she’s chosen a winner until she bites into it, met with either the reward of a sweet-tart crunch or the terrible disappointment of woolly, flavorless mush. Apple farmers face the same challenge as grocery shoppers, but on a more financially significant scale. To maximize the quality and storage life of their fruit, they must harvest it at peak ripeness—the precise moment at which the adolescent apple reaches its hormonal high point. (In plants, the hormone ethylene stimulates fruit ripening, as well as leaf dropping and root-hair growth.) Bringing in a crop too early or too late can make or break a season. But, as at the supermarket, there are precious few ways of gauging ripeness reliably.","415","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/laser-judge-apple-ripeness"
"For the grower looking to optimize his harvest schedule, scientists have developed a selection of instruments that outsource the mouth’s analytical abilities. A 2001 “Harvest How-To” in American Fruit Grower magazine profiles three industry-standard tools: the iodine-starch test, the refractometer, and the penetrometer. All, sadly, require the sacrifice of an apple or dozen. The penetrometer, which assesses flesh firmness, is essentially a hole punch. The refractometer measures the amount of sugar in a few drops of juice. The iodine test shows how much starch is present in a cross-section of apple tissue. (Iodine reacts with the starch, dyeing the tissue purple-black. A lighter dye usually means a sweeter apple.) The elusive quality of ripeness, according to these devices, lies at a firmness of fewer than sixteen pounds per square inch, a sweetness of fourteen or more degrees on the Brix scale, and a starchiness that matches pictures four through six on a varietal-specific chart. Variations in sun exposure, fruit size, tree crop load, and other factors, however, can skew the results. It’s possible to measure ripeness precisely in a laboratory, using a gas chromatograph to analyze ethylene levels in an apple’s core, but no grower can afford to have his apples tested every few days during the harvest.","416","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/laser-judge-apple-ripeness"
"Of course, farmers have taste buds, and many ultimately rely on them. As Chris Sandwick, a grower of SweeTango apples, told a blogger in 2011, “We are certainly looking at scientific measurements. But, at the end of the day, we know what a good SweeTango should taste like.” Nevertheless, the larger problem remains: when an apple is perfectly ripe, according to a penetrometer or a person’s palate, it is no longer part of the harvest. It has been destroyed in order to provide an indication of where the rest of an orchard stands. And, in a market that values Snickers-level reliability—a consistent flavor experience, guaranteed—the apple is hobbled by its unpredictability. “If we’re going up against potato chips and candy bars, we can’t have every third apple not tasting the way it should,” Sandwick says.","417","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/laser-judge-apple-ripeness"
"For years, pomologists soldiered on in the quest to create an instrument that rivalled the capacities of the human mouth without mimicking its destructiveness. They used infrared scanners to determine an apple’s chlorophyll levels and magnetic-resonance equipment to probe its interior, with varying accuracy and practicability in the field. (The typical MRI unit is not well suited to the orchard or the packinghouse.) Growers, meanwhile, largely stuck to their iodine spray bottles and their gut feelings. That was the state of things until last month, when a paper in the journal Applied Optics suggested that the holy grail of ripeness detection might finally be within reach.","418","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/laser-judge-apple-ripeness"
"The new technique, which was developed by a team of French and Lebanese scientists, uses a helium-neon gas laser to create speckle patterns, the grainy distributions of light that an object scatters back when it is hit with a beam. These patterns serve as a kind of optical fingerprint, a unique reflection of the object’s surface—and, in the case of certain organic matter, its subsurface—at a given moment. (Doctors sometimes use them as a noninvasive way of monitoring blood flow to tumors.) With a relatively inexpensive setup—the laser, some polarizing lenses, and a digital camera—the French-Lebanese group peered inside a batch of Golden Delicious apples that had been harvested on the same day from the same tree, measuring how their speckle patterns changed in the course of a month. As a reference, they also tracked how much ethylene the apples released by putting them inside a sealed box for two hours each day, sampling the air around them with a gas syringe, and then analyzing its composition.","419","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/laser-judge-apple-ripeness"
"For the first week, the apples marched toward ripeness, pumping out more and more ethylene by the day. Meanwhile, the recorded size of each speckle kept shrinking, from thirteen pixels across on the first day to nine across on the eighth. The apple’s speckle pattern, in other words, was becoming less diffuse as its ethylene production increased. From the ninth day onward, as ethylene output decreased, the speckles began to swell back up to their original dimensions, signalling that the apple had passed its so-called climacteric peak. Its best days were over, and the inexorable softening had begun.","420","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/laser-judge-apple-ripeness"
"Scientists had already used speckle patterns to judge the main proxies of ripeness: firmness, starch and sugar content, and, most recently, chlorophyll levels. Now they could judge ethylene levels, true ripeness’s invisible tell. Better still, they could gather their data without doing any damage to the apple. In a press release, the lead author of the Applied Optics study, Rana Nassif, announced that her team’s next goal, once they have fine-tuned their method, is to make the technology available in portable form. In orchards around the world, Frost’s ladder and Homer’s basket may one day be joined by the handheld helium-neon laser gun, with its rods of orange light bouncing around as if at an eighties rave. Perhaps, in due course, such a device will come standard on smartphones, guaranteeing shoppers a win every time they play the apple lottery. Meanwhile, the mouth, freed of all ripeness-assessing responsibility, can look forward to a happy retirement.","421","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/laser-judge-apple-ripeness"

"In 1948, the movie director John Huston sent a telegram to Harold Ross, the editor of The New Yorker, complimenting the work of a young reporter named Lillian Ross, who had interviewed him for a piece about the blacklist. In “Come In, Lassie,” Ross had demonstrated a fine ear for the vanities and the inanities of Hollywood, positing that the famous dog was the only safely nonpolitical movie star. “We like Lassie. We’re sure of Lassie,” one M-G-M suit told her. “Katharine Hepburn goes out and makes a speech for Henry Wallace. Bang! We’re in trouble. Lassie doesn’t make speeches.”","425","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/1945-1955"
"A couple of years later, Huston—presumably confident of his own lack of vanity and inanity—invited Ross to observe what turned out to be the troubled making of his new film, “The Red Badge of Courage,” adapted from Stephen Crane’s novel. Ross undertook two years of reporting: she accompanied Huston on the set (the film was shot at his ranch in the San Fernando Valley), interviewed executives in their outlandishly lavish offices, and attended intimate gatherings of movie-industry folk. (“Good will was stamped on the faces of all, but there was no indication as to whom or what it was directed toward,” she writes of a birthday party for Huston, at Chasen’s.) The piece, which ran in installments in the magazine and then became a book, “Picture,” stands as a precursor of the New Journalism. Through an innovative use of dialogue and character, Ross exposes the paradoxical logic of Hollywood—in which, as one executive says without irony, the greatness of a movie “depends on how it is received by the public.”","426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/1945-1955"
"The right-wing talk-radio host Bob Grant used to call Governor Mario Cuomo “the sfaccimm”—an Italian epithet that Grant (whose given name was Robert Ciro Gigante) told me could be translated into something like “low-life,” “heel,” or “low-born.” “It’s not a dirty word,” Grant said, as if that somehow made his business—the wholesale degradation of public discourse—less odious. (Grant called Mayor David Dinkins “the men’s room attendant,” and assured me that there was nothing racial or ethnic in his choice of slur for either man.) This was in the spring of 1994, Cuomo’s final year as an elected official, and “The Bob Grant Show” on WABC was the no. 1 afternoon-drive-time show in New York City. I was a rookie freelance magazine writer working on a profile of the radio loudmouth, so I put in the requisite call to the Governor’s press office, in Albany, soliciting an interview, and got the requisite brush-off. And then, that evening, my phone rang, and the guy on the other end said, “Mario Cuomo here. Is this a good time?”","January 2, 2015","427","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomo-bob-grant-vile-radio-host"
"I knew his voice. He’d been my governor for a dozen years and had seemed, for a time, bound to become my President, or else, then, a Supreme Court Justice—and we were all then still adjusting to the fact that Cuomo would prefer not to. He was the Bartleby of American politics. He wasn’t a great governor. But he was a great speaker, and his voice stood for exactly the opposite of what Bob Grant’s stood for: raising the quality of public discourse, in substance, of course, and also in tone.

"“I don’t ever recall having a political argument with Bob Grant,” he began. “I’ve known him a long time. I’ve always liked him. I’ve helped him, which he’s aware of but never mentions.” Cuomo let that hang there, unexplained, then got to the point: “I never listen to him.”","430","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomo-bob-grant-vile-radio-host"
"“He calls you sfaccimm,” I said.","431","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomo-bob-grant-vile-radio-host"
"“I don’t know why,” the Governor said. “I assume it makes money for him.” But that didn’t satisfy him. The profit motive might explain Grant’s ugliness, but it left another question unanswered: Why was that particular form of ugliness—Cuomo summed it up as “divisiveness, scapegoating, name-calling, shouting, callousness, lack of civility”—profitable?","432","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomo-bob-grant-vile-radio-host"
"“It’s very interesting,” Cuomo said. “Hate sells.” He took it as a “measure of the times,” and, yet, he said, “I’m not sure that it’s different than it’s ever been.” He added that it brought to mind “the old Southern politician’s line—that any jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a good man or woman to build one.”","433","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomo-bob-grant-vile-radio-host"
"Cuomo had been a radio host himself, long ago. “I loved it. I just sat down, the light would go on, I’d start talking,” he said, which was a pretty good description of what he was doing on the phone with me. There was already murmuring that he would return to the air when he left office, which he did for a time. Still, he said, “I’ve had enough experience with it to suspect, and I’m just inches away from believing, that the audience is skewed; that there’s something about the format that encourages the most negative, the most angry people; that it’s used as a kind of catharsis. It’s not really an attempt at dialogue, it’s a catharsis: I’m angry and I’m going to get this off the chest, and I’m going to say it and say it to a larger community, I don’t want to discuss it, I’m already convinced—I think this guy’s a dope! That’s catharsis. That’s different from a poll, different from a dialogue. It indicates an unhappiness, but that’s an unhappiness that’s been around for a long time. Especially if you’re hard-working middle class from my old neighborhood. You look around at people that are poorer and not working and getting supported, and I’m knocking myself out, I’ve got nothing, and this guy’s poorer than me, but he’s being fed. I think the catharsis is not all good, because it does encourage, and it does get cyclical and retaliatory. I guess a psychiatrist would say there’s some good to the venting process, but it does also promote an attitude of saying, ‘Hey there’s nothing wrong with being filled with hate, there’s so much of it around.’ I don’t like that. There’s something about rhetorical violence that is ugly and worrying.”","434","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomo-bob-grant-vile-radio-host"

May he rest in peace.","435","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mario-cuomo-bob-grant-vile-radio-host"
"For years, the federal government supported the principle of net neutrality: the idea that broadband providers should treat all Internet traffic the same. Verizon and Comcast, for example, shouldn’t be able to block you from accessing sites that they consider competitive or threatening, and they shouldn’t be able to accelerate your access to sites that have paid them. But the legal authority supporting these rules was flawed, and last January a federal court struck them down.","February 5, 2015","436","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"
"Following the ruling, it seemed unlikely that the regulations would be replaced with a strong, or “battleship,” net-neutrality law. Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, or F.C.C., was said to be the cable companies’ man, and his first proposal was not very promising. It would have allowed for so-called slow lanes, giving cable companies the right to de-prioritize the speed of some Web sites in favor of others. Additionally, the Obama Administration hadn’t shown much willingness to argue with people who claimed, however speciously, that new laws would cause stocks to plummet. And nearly everyone agreed that companies like Comcast and A. T. & T., some of the largest donors in Washington, had long ago bought off Congress and maybe the F.C.C. as well.","437","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"
"","438","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"
"But, on Wednesday, Wheeler confessed to a change of heart. It was a Nixon-goes-to-China moment. He wrote, in Wired magazine, “Originally, I believed that the FCC could assure Internet openness through a determination of ‘commercial reasonableness.’ ” But, he said, he had come to fear that a weak rule would “be interpreted to mean what is reasonable for commercial interests, not consumers.” Instead, he continued, “I am submitting to my colleagues the strongest open Internet protections ever proposed by the FCC.” With those words, Tom Wheeler became a net-neutrality hero.","439","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"
"How exactly did this come to be? Whatever opponents may think, there is no conspiracy; there was no shady or powerful actor pushing for this outcome. In fact, large companies like Google and Facebook, which favor net neutrality, decided to sit on their hands. And while startups, which have the most to lose because they’re likely to end up in slow lanes, did make strong net neutrality their cause, they have little influence in Washington. The real reason for the shift was something occasionally happens in a democracy: enough of the population caught wind of what was going on and said they didn’t like it. And then the chairman of the F.C.C. and the President noticed. All of which his begs another question: The public doesn’t usually react so passionately to telecom rules—what caused so many people to care about this particular issue?","440","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"
"For one thing, net neutrality, particularly when cast as the prospect of “Internet slow lanes” tapped into strong anxieties about inequality. Would the Internet become dominated by just a handful of wealthy companies that could afford to pay for fast connections to users? The link between financial inequality and net neutrality reached the President. And so, in November, when he finally demanded a strong net-neutrality rule, he framed his argument as way of allowing for a fair fight between large and small, rich and poor: “An entrepreneur’s fledgling company should have the same chance to succeed as established corporations,” he said. “Access to a high-school student’s blog shouldn’t be unfairly slowed down to make way for advertisers with more money.”","441","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"
"Polls show that more than three-quarters of Americans don’t like the idea of slow lanes for certain online content. The idea that the Internet would be tiered like so much else—for instance, boarding an airplane—is appealing to few people other than those who run cable companies. Citizens may not have much faith in the government, but it’s clear that they have even less faith in the companies that provide broadband.","442","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"
"It is also true that open Internet, though far from perfect, has come to represent a somewhat unpredictable and exciting frontier, a place where people can invent and explore new things. The cable companies, by demanding the right to control access, seemed to want to block off that frontier. For the past ten years, the cable-and-telephone industry has been saying that it needs fast lanes to help technology evolve. But the Internet continued to progress despite the absence of fast lanes. Net neutrality, the de-facto rule, seemed to be working, and the industry’s demands for fast lanes became a solution looking for a problem.","443","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"
"All of these factors, in some combination, managed to convince the public, and then President Obama and the chairman of the F.C.C., that net neutrality was important. And there’s a lesson to be learned here: the equalitarian instinct reflected in the campaign to protect net neutrality doesn’t seem likely to just go away, and it may not bode well for some of the largest Internet firms, like Facebook and Amazon, should they be perceived as straying too far from the ideals of openness and egalitarianism.","444","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"
"Of course, balls can be intercepted on the one-yard line. There will be a last-minute lobbying effort against Wheeler’s proposal. Congress could also overrule him, and, of course, in an age in which suing agencies has become a corporate reflex, someone will likely ask the courts to overturn his handiwork. But, barring any surprises, Wheeler’s strong version of net neutrality will soon be the law of the land. And that is something that our democracy can be proud of.","445","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/net-neutrality-shows-democracy-can-work"

"Early last week, while the political world was waiting for Hillary Clinton to address the moral, diplomatic, and technological questions posed by her e-mail habits, the United Nations issued a report asserting that more than one in three women experience sexual or physical violence in their lifetimes. One in ten females under the age of twenty is subjected to “forced sexual acts.” In more than thirty countries, it is not illegal for men to beat their wives. In the United States, eighty-three per cent of girls between twelve and sixteen confront sexual harassment in school. Even the earnest bureaucrats of the U.N., who tend to favor euphemism and skip over cruelties like honor killings and “corrective rape,” could not help but label the rate and the variety of mayhem regularly exacted upon half of humankind as “alarmingly high.”","467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"The report went on to say that female political representation, while creeping higher, is still depressingly low––not least in the world’s oldest constitutional democracy, the United States. The parliaments of South Africa, Ecuador, Finland, Senegal, Sweden, Cuba, Belgium, and Rwanda are all more than forty per cent female. The percentage of members in the U.S. House of Representatives who are women is eighteen. And, since it will soon be political high season on cable TV and at the town halls and diners of Iowa and New Hampshire, it bears repeating that no woman has ever been the President of the United States.","468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"It was hard not to think of this status report on the condition of women in the twenty-first century while Hillary Clinton stepped into the lights before an agitated crowd of reporters at the U.N. last Tuesday. A large tapestry of “Guernica” hung behind her, and she looked no happier in that setting than the tormented figures in Picasso’s image of civil war. And yet contrition was not in her plans. Instead, she chose a familiar course, offering explanations that were by turns petulant and pretzelled. Asked about the way she chose to deal with federal guidelines on e-mail when she was the Secretary of State, she said, “I opted for convenience.” Clinton’s further explanations were so familiar, such a ride in the Wayback Machine, that you had to wonder, Why do I suddenly feel twenty years younger yet thoroughly exhausted?","469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"The U.N. Secretary-General’s report is a progress report on the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which grew out of the 1995 World Conference on Women. At that conference, Clinton, as First Lady, gave an unsparing assessment of so many of the grimmer aspects of the female condition: political exclusion, discrimination, rape as a weapon of war, genital cutting, forced illiteracy, forced abortion and sterilization. She performed in a way that suggested both conviction and political talent independent of her role as the President’s wife and counsellor. The speech was as eloquent in its way as Barack Obama’s “race speech,” in the 2008 campaign, not because of its radical originality––like Obama’s, it was rooted in decades of progressive thought––but because of its potential to affect policy and mainstream opinion. “It is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights” was a message she delivered with clarity, particulars, and force.","470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"This was one reason that the press conference last week—given, presumably, as Clinton was preparing to announce a run for the Presidency, in 2016—was so dispiriting. At that moment at the U.N., she should have been returning to those feminist themes, but she used the opportunity to claim that she was only trying to protect the sanctity of her communications about her “yoga routines,” her daughter’s wedding, and her mother’s funeral. This was a notably transparent exploitation of gender. It’s one thing for a politician to be stupid; it is quite another for her to assume that we are. And what to make of a politician who protested the war in Vietnam and investigated the Watergate scandals but now writes a valentine to Henry Kissinger in the Washington Post—a book review in which Clinton calls Kissinger “surprisingly idealistic”? The peoples of Chile, Cambodia, Argentina, Bangladesh, and East Timor surely want to know more.","471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"As the Clinton campaign machinery creaks into motion, voters, too, will want to know more. For one thing, who will compete with her? The likeliest Republican candidates do not exactly stride the earth as political colossi. Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, is fast accumulating pots of right-wing money, but that is no guarantee that he can emerge from the ideological margins. Jeb Bush only recently secured his mother’s blessing to run and cannot hope to inspire a frenzy of support with the proposition that he is somewhat brighter than his retired older brother.","472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"It is the job of the press to put pressure on power and on pretenders to power. Even in a solo primary race, reporters will scrutinize not only Hillary Clinton’s record but also her hawkish foreign-policy impulses, the dealings of the Clinton Global Initiative, and the contradiction between the need to ease the inequality gap and the candidate’s tropism toward big money. But, in the absence of a Democratic challenger, the pressure will never be what it ought to be.","473","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"

However vexed by the politics of gender, America is ready for a woman President. Long past ready. A female President committed to the kind of vision Clinton set out twenty years ago in Beijing could exert a powerful influence on the lives of women all over the world. But if, in the end, Hillary Clinton’s only competition is herself, if all she has to contend with is the press and her less attractive instincts, she will have gained a too easy path to power at the cost of being less prepared to exercise it.","474","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"

"Twenty-five years ago, when a doctor named Robert Ross was the deputy health commissioner of Philadelphia, a measles epidemic swept the country. Until this year’s outbreak, which started at Disneyland and has so far sickened more than a hundred people, the 1989-91 epidemic was the most alarming that the United States had seen since 1963, when the measles vaccine was introduced. Nationwide, there were more than fifty-five thousand cases and eleven thousand hospitalizations; a hundred and twenty-three people died. Most of those infected were unimmunized babies and toddlers, predominantly poor and minority kids living in cities. Ross thought that the blame for the outbreak could be placed partly on poverty and partly on crack cocaine, which was “making a lot of families forget how to raise children.”","476","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/immune-3"
"One cluster of kids was getting sick, though, not because their parents lacked the wherewithal to have them immunized but because the parents, members of the Faith Tabernacle congregation, did not believe in immunization. When children in the congregation started dying—ultimately, five did—Ross and his colleagues began going door to door, telling parents that kids whose lives were in danger could be hospitalized by court order. In one house, Ross found an ashen-faced girl of eight or nine who could barely breathe. He got her to the hospital and, when he saw her the next day in the I.C.U., had no doubt that taking her from her home had saved her life. The memory of those who weren’t saved still troubles Ross: “These were kids who had no business being lowered into the ground. And I’ve never gotten over it.”","477","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/immune-3"
"The epidemic spurred the creation, in 1993, of a federal program, Vaccines for Children, which subsidized shots for children who were uninsured or on Medicaid*. Immunization rates soared. Then a new skepticism about vaccination settled in—this time, more often than not, among affluent parents who were drawn to holistic living and were dubious about medical authority. An infamous 1998 study in The Lancet, which claimed that the rising incidence of autism was linked to vaccinations, was particularly influential with some of those parents—even though the data were found to be falsified and the author’s medical license was revoked. Another theory, tying autism to thimerosal, a preservative added to vaccines, has also been debunked. Since 2001, thimerosal has been used only in the flu vaccine—and there is a thimerosal-free alternative—but the incidence of autism continues to rise.","478","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/immune-3"
"Nevertheless, the skepticism endured, and one result has been the decisive return of infectious diseases. First, it was whooping cough: in 2012, more than forty-eight thousand cases and twenty deaths were reported to the Centers for Disease Control, the greatest number since 1955. Now it’s measles. Both illnesses pose an especially serious threat to babies (infants under a year old cannot be vaccinated against measles**) and to people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons—if their immune systems are weakened by cancer drugs, for instance—and the complications are costly to treat. As many as one in every twenty children with measles will develop pneumonia; one in every thousand will develop encephalitis, which can leave a child deaf or brain-damaged. In addition, measles is airborne and extremely contagious; virus transmitted by a sneeze on the Dumbo ride or in the doctor’s-office waiting room can still infect people an hour later. That is why, in the case of measles, a community generally needs more than ninety per cent of its members to be immunized against the virus in order to protect those who can’t be. “Herd immunity” doesn’t work unless most of the herd is vaccinated.","479","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/immune-3"
"What does work is legislation. The highest vaccination rate in the country is in Mississippi, a state with an otherwise dismal set of health statistics. It allows people to opt out of vaccines only for medical reasons—not for religious or personal ones. States that make it easier not to vaccinate have higher rates of infectious diseases. California, which has seen ninety-nine cases in this epidemic, is one of nineteen states that allow people to opt out not only for religious and medical reasons but also on the basis of a loosely defined “personal belief.” In 2012, though, the state legislature passed a law requiring parents to consult with a health-care professional about vaccination before they reject it, and the opt-out rates declined slightly for the first time in years. (Washington passed a similar law and has experienced a bigger decline.) Last week, legislators in California introduced a bill to eliminate the personal-belief exemption—but that may actually be too abrupt and punitive a solution. According to some epidemiologists who study the anti-vaccine movement, it’s probably more effective to continue to enforce a regime that makes it more difficult but not impossible for parents to opt out.","480","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/immune-3"
"What does not help at all is to treat vaccines and the diseases they prevent as partisan political matters. In 1993, when the Clinton Administration championed Vaccines for Children, it drew bipartisan support; it would have seemed bizarre to cast a measure aimed at preventing epidemics of childhood disease in ideological terms. In fact, until recently, vaccine refusal wasn’t a partisan issue—some objections came from anti-government types but many were from self-identified progressives. In the current discussion, however, conservatives have been embracing a precious individual right to shun inoculation. On Fox News, Sean Hannity declared that he wasn’t “trusting President Obama to tell me whether to vaccinate my kids.” Asked about immunization on CNN last week, Senator Rand Paul, a potential Republican candidate for President—and a doctor—painted a pointlessly terrifying scenario: “I’ve heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.” No doubt, he has heard such stories, but the evidence does not support them. Governor Chris Christie said that he and his wife had chosen to get their kids immunized, but he made it sound like a not especially consequential life-style choice, adding the confusing dictum “Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public-health threat as others.” A keen understanding of public health is not one of Christie’s virtues: recall his quarantine of the nurse who did not have Ebola.","481","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/immune-3"
"Robert Ross believes that “doubling down on education” about infectious diseases will help the situation, but he wonders if that’s enough to “reacquaint some parents”—not to mention some elected officials—“with the dangers of these diseases.” Ross had to rely on the law and the courts to help him save children’s lives in Philadelphia. By then, the situation was dire. He worries that more children will die unnecessary deaths before reason again takes hold. ♦","482","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/immune-3"

"The state of the union is “strong,” President Obama declared last night, and so, it turns out, was the State of the Union address. Tuesday’s speech looked hale and fit, weighing in at around sixty-five hundred words and almost exactly sixty minutes and lifting members of Congress out of their seats like a speech half its age (two hundred and twenty-five years). This might come as a surprise; just last week, Politico accused the President of “killing” the speech by rolling out pieces of it in the days and weeks beforehand. Obama’s “SOTU Spoilers,” as the White House insisted on calling them, were said, by other commentators, to have “robbed the event of suspense.” (The White House delivered the ultimate spoiler when, minutes before the speech, it released the full text on the Web site Medium.)","January 21, 2015","485","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"Never mind that the State of the Union usually has all the drama of the Queen’s annual Christmas message. Arguably, the spoilers—which included steps to normalize relations with Cuba and a proposal to finance middle-class tax cuts by raising capital-gains and inheritance taxes—kept President Obama and the speech at center stage over the past month, displacing the new Republican Congress. Of course, the Nielsen ratings, which will be released today, might show a further decline in viewership of the State of the Union; last year’s audience of 33.3 million was less than two-thirds that of Obama’s first address to Congress, in 2009. If so, it isn’t Obama’s fault so much as your own. The narrowing of the national attention span has not been kind to long speeches. Besides, the only proven way to gin up interest in the State of the Union is to gin up a preëmptive war in the Middle East, which is the approach that George W. Bush took in 2003. That year’s speech, which preceded the invasion of Iraq by several weeks, attracted sixty-two million viewers, the largest audience since 1993.

"Since most of President Obama’s initiatives were already familiar, the most notable aspect of Tuesday’s address was his tone: upbeat, unapologetic. Obama did not sound like a man whose party had just lost the Senate. (Senator Harry Reid, however, looked like that man.) Nor did he appear at all prepared to accept the limits that Republicans want to place on his Presidency. Last night, Obama had the punchy, self-assured air of a President on a roll, freed of old encumbrances (a narrow, nervous Democratic majority in the Senate) and buoyed by both a big jump in his approval ratings and, most important, a growing economy. “We have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth,” he said.","487","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"In recent months, as job creation has heated up, some Democrats have warned the President against this kind of ebullience. “People are in trouble,” the political strategist Stan Greenberg told the Times, after reportedly saying the same thing to David Simas, the White House political director. Indeed, many are, as Obama acknowledged last night. “Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?” he asked. His legislative agenda—for example, his sixty-billion-dollar plan to make community college free for most students—shows his refusal to accept that reality, and aims squarely at the problem of income inequality. At the same time, Obama was unrestrained in his discussion of America’s economic progress—and the role that he has played in it. “At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,” the President said. “Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health-care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.” Here he paused, savored these statistics, then ad-libbed: “This is good news, people.” A wink, a smile, a sideways glance. This is a man who is pleased with himself.","488","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"For Obama, this constitutes a meaningful shift. Long constrained by his own overcautiousness, he has, for several months now, been parting by degrees with his reluctance to talk about economic growth and job gains. As recently as April, in a speech about the minimum wage, he offered no indication that the economy was improving, except to say—a bit accusingly—that “those at the top are doing better than ever.” By summer, as the midterm elections approached, he had warmed to saying that, “by almost every measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office.” Last night’s address featured his most full-throated expression of satisfaction about the recovery yet. He has, in his phrase of choice, “turned the page.”","489","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obama-turns-page-2015-state-union"
"The reason this matters is that it’s not, in the end, only about taking credit; it’s about credibility. President Obama won’t have much of the latter unless he claims more of the former. By reminding Americans how far the nation has come since the financial crisis of 2008, and what it took to get here, Obama can create at least a little more public confidence in his plans for the rest of his time in office. Of course, that doesn’t mean he’ll have much success getting his agenda through Congress. But, if he sticks to his own story, and tells it repeatedly, he might have at least a fighting chance of winning an argument with the G.O.P. over, say, what elements to include in a tax-reform deal, or which party can, in 2016, be trusted with the hopes of middle-class Americans.

"Louis Freeh enjoys an exalted public reputation, though there may be reason to wonder why. As the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the nineteen-nineties, he ingratiated himself with congressional Republicans by conducting numerous investigations of the Clinton White House, which produced more news leaks than criminal convictions. The Central Intelligence Agency absorbed a great deal of blame for the intelligence failures leading up to 9/11, but those attacks took place on American soil, which the F.B.I. is also supposed to protect.

In 2011 and 2012, Freeh led the internal investigation of Pennsylvania State University following the disclosure that Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at the school, had been a serial child molester. The story has largely disappeared from the national media, but it remains big news in Pennsylvania. This week, Graham Spanier, the president of the university who lost his job in the scandal, filed a lawsuit against Freeh for defaming him in his report. (Spanier’s hundred-and-forty-three-page complaint is available online. I interviewed Spanier about the Sandusky case in 2012.)","492","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"

"Sandusky is serving a much-deserved sentence of thirty to sixty years; he is seventy-one, and so will likely spend the rest of his life in prison. Joe Paterno, who had been Penn State’s head coach for more than forty years, was fired, and died soon afterward. Spanier, who had become president of the university in 1995 and was widely admired, resigned. Spanier took the fall for, according to Freeh, failing to follow up on reports of Sandusky’s abuse. Freeh wrote that Spanier acted in “consistent disregard … for the safety and welfare of Sandusky’s child victims.” He also wrote that Spanier “empowered Sandusky to attract potential victims to the campus,” and that Spanier “repeatedly concealed … Sandusky’s child abuse.” Spanier’s lawsuit claims that this is false. (Freeh’s spokeswoman told me that Freeh would have no comment on Spanier’s lawsuit against him.) Spanier and two other university administrators have also been criminally charged with perjury, obstruction of justice, and other charges, but that case is snarled in pretrial proceedings.","494","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"
"Freeh’s case against Spanier focusses on two incidents that he failed to respond appropriately to: one, in 1998, and another, in 2001. In the first, a woman called the university police to report that Sandusky had showered with her eleven-year-old son. The police, as well as local social-services agencies, investigated the woman’s claim and closed the investigation after advising Sandusky not to take any more showers with children. (Though Spanier was made aware of the investigation, it’s not clear what Spanier knew about the incident.) Sandusky quit his university job in 1999, leaving to work at his children’s charity, the Second Mile, though he was given coach emeritus status and access to athletic facilities. In the second matter, from 2001, a graduate assistant named Mike McQueary witnessed an incident in the locker-room shower between Sandusky and a young boy; he later testified that he thought the boy was being raped. He reported it in some form to Joe Paterno, the head coach at Penn State. The precise nature of how McQueary described what he saw to Paterno, and how Paterno described it to others, has long been open to dispute, but witnesses testified that Spanier was never told directly that what McQueary witnessed had been a sexual assault. Spanier said that he understood it as “horsing around in the shower.” In any event, Spanier signed off on a plan for Sandusky to be told not to bring children to the main campus any longer, and to inform the head of the Second Mile about the situation. It is difficult to square Spanier’s behavior and Freeh’s broad condemnation.","495","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"
"The Sandusky story set off an understandable, and immediate, storm of outrage. Many news reports condemned the university, especially Paterno and Spanier, for purportedly enabling a molester to operate in their midst. Freeh used his report to reinforce that initial impression. As it turned out, Freeh’s denunciations of Spanier were a lot clearer than his actual evidence against him. Indeed, in the years since, the story of the university’s behavior has turned out to be considerably more complex than it originally seemed. For its part, the N.C.A.A. has eased up on some of the sanctions that it initially imposed on Penn State. It restored a hundred and twelve football victories, which had been stripped from the university’s record, and allowed all of a $60 million fine paid by Penn State to be spent in Pennsylvania, instead of being spread around the country.","496","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"
"To be sure, Spanier’s case against Freeh will always be a long shot. The legal standard for public figures, like Spanier, who bring a defamation case is extremely, and appropriately, high; Spanier will have to prove either that Freeh knew his report was false or that Freeh displayed reckless disregard for whether it was true. Still, the very complexity of the facts as they have eventually emerged should remind us of the risk of rushing to judgment.","497","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/new-twist-penn-state-case"

More vacancies means more competition for workers, which should eventually lead to a sustained increase in wages. Indeed, contrary to popular perception, wages are already rising more than prices. Not by much, it is true, but in the year leading up to January, according to the Labor Department, average hourly earnings in outside the farm sector rose by 2.2 per cent.

And it would look a lot less like 2008, when John McCain, burdened by a recession, failed to pull off a party three-peat.","506","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"To oversimplify things a bit, Bush, Sr., and Gore both promised voters more of the same, but with a different face in the White House. In 2008, with the economy in recession, McCain didn’t have the option of running on his predecessor’s domestic legacy, and he had great difficulty articulating a coherent alternative. Of course, many other factors affected the race, including George W. Bush’s disastrous war in Iraq and McCain’s shortcomings as a candidate, but the comatose economy was a big burden on the Republicans, just as it would be on the Democrats in 2016 if job growth were still lagging.","507","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"A buoyant economy changes the whole environment. If Hillary Clinton (assuming she gets the Democratic nomination) can wholeheartedly embrace President Obama’s domestic record rather than have to equivocate and point out what, if anything, she would have done differently, her task will be much easier. The Democrats aren’t there yet, but things are going in the right direction for them, and the improved economic situation is already having an impact on public opinion.","508","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"During the past few months, there has been a notable uptick in Presidential Obama’s approval rating. The numbers vary from survey to survey, but the Real Clear Politics poll average shows Obama’s rating rising from a low of 41.3 per cent in October to a high of 46.2 per cent on February 2nd. One or two individual polls have seen the President hit fifty per cent. If the economic news stays positive, the upward move will almost certainly continue. “Americans’ ratings of Obama appear to be catching up with their improved economic views,” Gallup’s Lydia Saad noted.","509","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"The economic argument shouldn’t be pushed too far, however. In 1988, Bush, Sr., was facing an uninspiring opponent in Michael Dukakis. In 2000, Gore, for all his success in winning the popular vote, still lost the election (with the assistance of the Supreme Court). Plus, the electoral environment is changing. A new update from Gallup shows that Americans are more polarized than ever where the Presidency is concerned. The gap in Obama’s approval rating among Republicans and Democrats has averaged seventy per cent, higher than George W. Bush’s average of sixty-one per cent, Clinton’s fifty-six, and Reagan’s fifty-two. Come 2016, there may be fewer centrist voters who will cast their ballots on the basis of their own material welfare.","510","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"

The election of Barack Obama, the first African-American President, came while a significant portion of the electorate believed him to be lying about his origins, his politics, and his religion––a phenomenon captured in Barry Blitt’s notorious preëlection “fist bump” cover, in 2008. The promise of 1989-91 has stalled, for now, in the authoritarian regimes in Moscow and Beijing. The Arab Spring has ended with a military-backed regime in Cairo, civil war in Syria, and a fanatical would-be caliphate under the banner of isis. At home, the empowerment, and marriage rights, of gay men and lesbians coexists with the lingering legacy of racial tension. The awareness of nearly all the world’s leaders of the imminence of devastating climate change has roused almost none of them to effective action.","515","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/2005-2015"
"Nor has the overwhelming rise of the Internet overwhelmed the forces of cruelty. History is unawed. Part of the Obama temperament––infuriating to some, inspiringly sane to others––is to recognize that reality. “I think we are born into this world and inherit all the grudges and rivalries and hatreds and sins of the past,” the President said in a series of interviews for The New Yorker. “But we also inherit the beauty and the joy and goodness of our forebears. And we’re on this planet a pretty short time, so that we cannot remake the world entirely during this little stretch that we have. But I think our decisions matter.” He added, “At the end of the day, we’re part of a long-running story.

"The news that John Boehner has been reëlected as Speaker of the House of Representatives brings to mind the old joke, sometimes attributed to W. C. Fields, about a contest that offered a first prize of one week in Philadelphia and a second prize of two weeks in Philadelphia. No insult intended to the City of Brotherly Love, which is a fine place for all sorts of reasons, but you get the idea: Who would voluntarily sign on for another two years of shepherding, or attempting to shepherd, the Republican caucus in the House of Representatives?","January 6, 2015","517","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"As the 114th Congress gathered in the Capitol, Boehner did just that, and, despite opposition from a number of ultra-conservatives who have long regarded him as too moderate and cozy with the Obama Administration, he won two hundred and sixteen of the four hundred and six votes cast. In part, he had the late Mario Cuomo to thank. With a number of Democratic congressmen missing the leadership vote to attend Cuomo’s funeral, in New York, the Speaker could have lost as many as thirty-five G.O.P. members and still achieved a majority—this according to the tallies of the folks at the Washington Post’s The Fix and at Politico, anyway. But Boehner’s success isn’t purely a matter of timing. With the departure of Eric Cantor, his former number two, to the sunnier and more lucrative climes of Wall Street, Boehner lacks an obvious successor. The Republicans, and the rest of us, are stuck with him.","518","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"Which, perhaps, isn’t the worst possible outcome. Although Boehner is hardly in the tradition of Henry Clay, Sam Rayburn, and Tip O’Neill, he isn’t nearly as bad as some of the possible alternatives, such as Louie Gohmert, the Texas congressman who announced over the weekend that he would offer himself as a candidate for Speaker. (He ultimately received three votes, including his own.) If you haven’t been watching Fox News and C-SPAN closely, Gohmert’s contributions to the civic discourse may have passed you by. They include comparing President Obama to Hitler, calling for higher taxes for the poor, claiming that America is being infiltrated by “terror babies,” and warning that the U.S. military is allowing gay soldiers to sit around all day and massage each other, thereby courting ruin. (No, really, he did say that, in a television interview. A helpful post at Mother Jones details this and other Gohmert contributions.)","519","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"Compared to Gohmert and his ilk, Boehner seems like a conservative but ultimately rational member of the Rotary Club. To be sure, he mouths all the usual G.O.P. lines about President Obama usurping the constitution with his immigration reforms, and about the Affordable Care Act destroying the economy. But he has shown little enthusiasm for responding to points of contention with the drastic measures that some Republican ultras favor, such as impeachment or shutting down the government. “I don’t do anger,” he told Politico’s Glenn Thrush, whose new profile of Boehner is well worth reading.","520","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"That quote sounds a bit self-serving, but it’s hard to have entirely negative feelings about someone who grew up working at his family’s bar, dresses like an extra from “Mad Men,” spends much of his time being harried by wingnuts, and, perhaps as a consequence, seems determined to smoke himself to an early grave. Boehner’s cancer stick of choice is a filtered Camel 99, and, according to Thrush, he “smokes more or less constantly when he’s out of the public eye.” He’s also on record as saying that he likes an occasional tipple. Who doesn’t?","521","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"The question, of course, is to what end the Speaker will exercise his reconfirmed authority, such as it is. In November’s midterm elections, the Republicans picked up another thirteen House seats. They now have a majority of more than fifty, the biggest margin in almost seventy years. Moreover, many of Boehner’s members, new and old, regard the election as a referendum on President Obama’s policies. There will be immediate pressure on him to secure some policy victories over the White House.","522","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"In all likelihood, the first showdown will come over the Keystone XL pipeline, an issue on which the Republicans rightly sense indecision in the White House. The House could pass a bill authorizing construction as early as Friday. Such a bill also seems certain to pass the Senate, which now has fifty-four Republican members. Obama would then be left with the decision of whether to veto it, and Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said on Tuesday that the President would, indeed, do that.","523","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"For Boehner, Keystone is an easy one. He’s a longtime supporter of the pipeline, and he knows it also has the support of a majority of Americans, including a fair number of Democrats, particularly in southern and western states. (Last April, eleven Democratic senators sent a letter to the White House urging approval of the pipeline.) But the Keystone votes are only the beginning. Republicans in the House won’t be content with pushing for an oil pipeline, and Boehner knows it. Before long, he will be facing calls to confront the White House on Obamacare, immigration, the debt limit, and other issues that animate the conservative base of the party. And urged on by the rabble-rousers like Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, the wingers will be in no mood to compromise.","524","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"After four years as Speaker, Boehner is under no illusions about any of this. Recounting a meeting in his office in late 2013, following the government shutdown, Thrush quotes the Ohioan as saying, “We got stampeded into a fight we tried to avoid. . . . These [Tea Party] people are crazy, crazy. . . . They just want a fight.” On that front, nothing has changed.","525","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/boehner-reelected-speaker-cigarettes"
"The optimistic take is that the Speaker and the President, each of whom is seeking to create a legacy for himself, will get together and make deals on issues like trade, infrastructure, and corporate taxation. The reality, however, is one of acute polarization on most issues, which leaves party leaders with little room to maneuver.

"Big news from Blighty: With just two and a half weeks until the May 7th election, the Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, a politician who, not long ago, was being lampooned as “Edweird” and “Red Ed,” is now the favorite to become Britain’s next Prime Minister. At the online-betting sites, which are very popular in the U.K., Miliband is odds-on to replace David Cameron, the leader of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition.","April 20, 2015","528","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"

"No one is expecting Labour to win an over-all majority in the House of Commons, mind you, and Miliband is only slightly favored over Cameron. At least in public, senior Conservatives are still expressing optimism that the prospect of Miliband entering 10 Downing Street will generate a last-minute swing in favor of the government. But a long series of opinion polls have shown the two major parties more or less tied, with about a third of the vote each. If that trend holds up until May 7th, the electoral map will almost certainly insure that Labour emerges as the largest party in parliament. Miliband could then form a coalition with the Scottish National Party or the Liberal Democrats, if the latter agrees to switch allegiances. He might also establish a minority government that looks to put together voting majorities on a bill-by-bill basis.","530","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"To constitutional historians, psephologists, and electoral-reform advocates, the uncertain situation, which reflects a generation-long decline in support for the two major parties, is a source of great excitement. To many ordinary Britons, it looks like a bit of a mess. But whatever happens in the next couple of weeks, one thing is certain: there will be no fundamental retreat from the austerity policies that Cameron and George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have inflicted on the British economy for the past five years. Desperate to shed Labour’s reputation as a party that overspent wildly in the run-up to the Great Recession, Miliband and his sidekick, Ed Balls, Labour’s economics spokesman, are promising to cut the budget deficit every year and to balance the books in the next Parliament, even if it means raising taxes to do so. They are marketing this set of policies as a “budget responsibility lock.”","531","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"Indeed, far from lambasting Cameron and Osborne for starving the British economy of public investment—according to some estimates, it has fallen by almost half since the government took office in 2010—and confining the country to a low-growth trap, Miliband and Balls are accusing the Tories of fiscal profligacy for unveiling a series of last-minute spending boosts, including one for the National Health Service, that they claim are unfunded. “You can’t fund the N.H.S. with an I.O.U.,” Miliband said at a campaign appearance last week. “Every promise we make is paid for. That is the difference between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party.”","532","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"To be sure, the two major parties’ budget plans aren’t identical. The government has promised to eliminate the deficit, which is currently running at about four per cent of G.D.P., by 2017-18, while Labour is giving itself until 2020-21 to meet that target. But, in insisting that his party’s spending plans would be “paid for without a single penny of extra borrowing,” Miliband has effectively conceded that Labour has lost the political argument over using Keynesian policies to boost the U.K.’s economy. Even as some erstwhile skeptics, such as the folks at the International Monetary Fund, have discovered the arguments for employing the public treasury to offset persistent weakness in private-sector investment, the country of the Master’s birth has largely abandoned his teachings.","533","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"I should emphasize that I am talking about the politics of the issue, not the economics. An illuminating article by Tim Harford in the Financial Times over the weekend made it clear that many British economists favor taking advantage of record-low interest rates to borrow money, rebuild Britain’s crumbling infrastructure, and invest in sustainable energy sources. That is a traditional Keynesian position, but one that the public doesn’t appear to support. Focus groups have showed that the promise of eliminating the deficit was one of the most popular elements of Labour’s manifesto, which was released last week. Despite the fact that the deficit has fallen by more than half, relative to G.D.P., since 2010, many Britons still think that their country is going broke, a proposition for which there is virtually no evidence. And many of the same voters still blame the last Labour government, which was led by Gordon Brown, for mismanaging public finances.","534","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"In these dire circumstances, it is easy to see why Miliband and Balls, rather than trying to educate the public about fiscal multipliers, the paradox of thrift, and other staples of Keynesian economics, chose to adopt the political strategy of “if you can beat them, join them.” In seeking to rebrand Labour as the party of fiscal responsibility, they have undercut the main accusation that the Tory press makes against them. “Clearly the Tory charge that Labour and its leader, Ed Miliband, were not to be trusted on spending and borrowing has hit home,” Simon Jenkins, one of Britain’s most astute political commentators, wrote in The Guardian last week. “Labour’s manifesto is an in-your-face rebuttal. Miliband has at least got the point. And no one even dares to breathe the word austerity.”","535","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"But, in signalling its break with Keynes, the Labour Party has not undergone a big shift to the right, and it would also be a mistake to conclude that its progressive tax-and-spend policies have been discredited. To the contrary, in eschewing the free lunches (or cheap lunches) that deficit financing might offer, Miliband and Labour have nonetheless adopted an explicitly redistributive policy agenda. They propose to tax the rich in order to pay for initiatives like expanding day care, reducing university-tuition fees, and hiring tens of thousands more doctors and nurses for the N.H.S. While Keynes was being unceremoniously booted out the front door of Labour’s headquarters, Thomas Piketty was being ushered in through the side entrance.","536","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"In its manifesto, Labour promised to raise the top income-tax rate from forty-five per cent to fifty per cent. (The income threshold for being subjected to this tax would be about two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars a year.) Labour also pledged to introduce a “mansion tax” on houses valued at more than three million dollars, of which there are many in London, in particular. And the Party promised to crack down on wealthy people who live in the United Kingdom but claim official residence elsewhere, to avoid paying their full share of British taxes—the so-called non-doms, as in non-domiciled.","537","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"Opinion polls suggest that the idea of cracking down on rich tax avoiders, who include some of Britain’s top business leaders, is particularly popular. It was after Miliband announced the new policy, a couple of weeks ago, that Labour first moved ahead in the polls. But the other two tax proposals, and the way that Labour is selling them, are equally important. Rather than just announcing the new taxes in isolation, the Party is saying explicitly what the monies they raise would be used for.","538","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"In pledging to restore the top tax rate to fifty per cent—the current government had lowered it—Labour said that it would use the proceeds to cut the tax rate paid by low earners to ten per cent. According to a poll carried out by YouGov last week, fifty-nine per cent of the public supports this policy and twenty-seven per cent opposes it. In announcing that it would introduce a new tax on luxury homes, Labour said that it would pay for new nurses and doctors in the N.H.S. Sixty-one per cent of voters said they liked this proposal; twenty-seven per cent said they didn’t. It’s worth pointing out that some of the Conservative Party’s policy proposals also proved popular in the poll, particularly its ideas to relieve people who earn minimum wage of having to pay income tax, and to place a limit on the total value of welfare benefits that a household can receive in a year. But, YouGov concluded, over all, “British people give better marks to Labour’s policy offerings.”","539","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/keynes-is-set-to-lose-the-british-election-but-piketty-may-win"
"There may be a message here for other countries, the United States included. Although British voters are suspicious of deficit financing and welfare spending, they seem to welcome the prospect of redistributive policies that target the rich and benefit those on modest incomes in identifiable ways that are spelled out in advance.

On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that she maintained her own home-brew server for the private e-mail address that she has been revealed to have used for work correspondence as Secretary of State, rather than relying on an outside service, such as Google or Yahoo. “Operating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails,” the A.P. story said.","543","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"Yesterday, I expressed some skepticism about whether the e-mail flap would amount to much over the long term, and about whether the Republicans would be able to use it against Clinton once the campaign proper starts. In seeking to keep her State Department e-mails from prying eyes, she clearly skirted the rules. But it appears that she didn’t break the federal recordkeeping laws in place at the time, and everyone knows that she has good reason to be paranoid: on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, many people are out to get her, Republican attack dogs prominent among them.","544","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"The danger to Clinton is cumulative and close to home. In the past few weeks, many Democrats, particularly those on the progressive wing of the party, have been reminded of their reservations about a Clinton restoration. To begin with, there was the spectacle of Hillary, fresh from the State Department, traipsing around the country making highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, the Carlyle Group and other redoubts of the one per cent. Last week came the revelation that foreign governments were making financial contributions to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was still serving as Secretary of State. And now there’s her e-mail system, which appears to have been explicitly designed to frustrate legitimate requests for documents from the media and from Congress. It all adds to the impression that the Clintons operate by their own set of rules.","545","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"So far, other potential Democratic challengers, who include Vice President Joe Biden and Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, have shied away from criticizing Hillary directly, but this may be about to change. During O’Malley’s recent trip to South Carolina, the Associated Press reported, he “took a veiled shot at Clinton, warning Democrats that more ‘triangulation’ would not be a successful strategy for the party.”","546","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"The reference, to Dick Morris’s term describing Bill Clinton’s strategy for transcending ideological polarities, hardly constituted a venomous attack. O’Malley, who began his career in politics by working for Gary Hart’s 1984 Presidential campaign, is a thoughtful and deliberate politician, rather than a showman or a brawler. His standing in Democratic politics is currently diminished, however, by the results of last November’s gubernatorial election, in which O’Malley’s chosen successor, his lieutenant governor, Anthony Brown, suffered an upset defeat to the Republican candidate, Larry Hogan.","547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"O’Malley had a strong record as governor, promoting the use of information technology, seeing liberal measures on immigration and gay marriage into law, and repealing the death penalty for future offenders. In recent months, he has been reaching out to progressives in the early primary states, and echoing many of the themes that made Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren popular, such as calling for the break-up of big banks. ”People want to see new faces,” Dan Calegari, a Democratic activist in New Hampshire, told the A.P. “There’s a certain amount of Clinton fatigue. They’ve been around for thirty years now. Quite honestly, I think if Martin decides to get in the race, he will surprise some people.”","548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"

Warren, despite her protestations that she won’t run, is at seven-to-one. Biden is at sixteen-to-one. Clinton remains the favorite, of course, but the betting markets suggest that the race isn’t entirely sewn up. At most of the bookmakers, the odds on her emerging as the Democratic candidate are one-to-three, which means that you would have to put down three dollars to win one dollar. These numbers imply that there’s a seventy-five-per-cent probability that Clinton will get the nomination. Until now, most political operatives and pundits, myself included, have been tacitly assuming that the chances that Hillary won’t be the Democratic candidate were lower than one in four.

Dressed in a black T-shirt, red Nike shorts, and magenta LeBron Xs, he dribbled a ball to the free-throw line, stopped, and did squats. “I’m thirty-two this year,” he said, “and this is the first year I feel old.”","552","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/hoop-dreams"
"Evan (six years younger, two inches taller) stood nearby, in matching LeBrons. He recently completed a degree in global studies at the New School, having taken four years off to help his brother open Baohaus.

"Growing up in a predominantly white neighborhood in Orlando (the family restaurant has since become a Hooters), the Huang boys didn’t need to be told they were different. “Ching-Chong Eddie Huang” was a frequent refrain from classmates, Eddie said. To fit in, he immersed himself in basketball, a sport his father loved, too. In a scene from the pilot episode of “Fresh Off the Boat,” the young Eddie (played by the cherubic Hudson Yang) begs his mother to buy him “white-people food” for lunch, then lays out his three-step plan for world domination: first, get a seat at the table; second, meet Shaquille O’Neal; third, change the game.","554","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/hoop-dreams"
"The sitcom doesn’t preserve much of Huang’s archness. “There’s definitely an issue with accuracy,” he said. He provided the voice-over but was not allowed to write the script. “That’s the great irony and metaphor for network television: even if they have a real story, they need to cook it into a version that mass Americans can digest.” This is particularly true of his father’s character. “I love Randall,” Huang said, referring to Randall Park, the actor who plays Huang senior. “But they’ve made my dad into a neutered tourist in a fanny pack and stonewashed khakis.”","555","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/hoop-dreams"

Last year, he presented his father with a birthday gift: a pair of LeBron Xs. And? Huang shook his head. “My dad has had shitty shoes his whole life,” he said. “When he saw these dope kicks, he just put them back into the box. ‘Too expensive!’ He wore them maybe once.

"In February, 1962, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, Republican of Maine, gave a speech at a Lincoln Day event in Bangor berating her fellow G.O.P. members for their hesitation about running for President. They were guilty, she said, of “faintheartedness”—the sort of insult that only a lady could deploy. According to an A.P. report from the speech, Smith, “without using names,” complained that the likeliest candidates—Richard M. Nixon, who had lost the previous election to John Kennedy; Governor Nelson Rockefeller, of New York; and Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona—were overly scared of J.F.K., whose reëlection seemed like an easy bet, and so were “waiting for a sunnier day.” (There was also Governor George Romney, but she dismissed him as a “sacrificial lamb.”) Republicans, she said, needed a man with some fight in him, someone “who is not afraid to lose.”","March 24, 2015","559","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"

"Reading Smith’s words half a century, and thirteen Presidential elections, later, one is struck by three things. First, the uncertainty of politics, and in this case the potential for tragedy—John F. Kennedy would be murdered a year before the election he seemed sure to win. Second, the fact that the hesitation Smith saw is not a problem for the G.O.P. today; this much was evident when Ted Cruz took the stage, on Monday, to inform the public of his run for the Presidency and his role in America’s redemption. His announcement was followed by speculation about which Republican would be next: Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, et al. There’s no real suspense about whether these men want to run, just about when their leadership PACs and exploratory committees will change their names to campaigns. The candidates might not make much sense, but they will surely fulfill Smith’s injunction of not being afraid to lose.","561","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"
"And one of them, as it’s always strange to remember, will win—the nomination, if not the Presidency. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal argued that, although “neither man will like this comparison,” there are parallels between Cruz’s candidacy and Obama’s, which seemed so unlikely until he won. (Indeed, Cruz did not like it, saying that Obama had only been a “backbencher.”) If the election that followed Smith’s remarks, in 1964, and the career of Barry Goldwater indicate anything, it is that what are seen as constraints on Cruz’s rise—radical positions, unpopularity within his own party, near buffoonery—don’t always keep a candidate down, even at the highest levels. This leads to a third conclusion: that Ted Cruz might actually get on the national ticket.","562","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"
"Like Cruz, Goldwater was extreme, and as he said, in one of his best-known speeches, he didn’t consider this a vice. His extremism was not simply of the small-government variety, although that is what those who venerate him tend to invoke. He mused about letting NATO commanders use atomic weapons on the battlefield according to their own judgement. In May, 1964, when the American presence in Vietnam was a fraction of what it would become, he was asked how he’d handle the problem of Vietnamese supply lines in the jungle, which were hard to see. There had been several suggestions, he said, that probably wouldn’t be pursued, “but defoliation of the forests by low-grade atomic weapons could well be done.” That was a few months before his party handed him the nomination.","563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"
"Goldwater was not seen as entirely serious; one defense of his extremism was that it was simple clumsiness. He was not a disciplined speaker. (Cruz certainly is; read Jeffrey Toobin’s Profile.) In 1963, Jacob Javits, a Republican Senator from New York, told the A.P. that Goldwater’s backers included “some pretty sad elements on the ultra-right.” Javits said that he was a supporter of Rockefeller, who represented “more mainstream” positions. That same year, the Times doubted that Goldwater could get his party’s support. J.F.K. amused reporters with jokes about him.","564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"
"Goldwater is sometimes invoked as a cautionary tale, a lesson that both parties learned: nominate the extremist, and your party will lose. (Other than his native Arizona, he only won five states, all in the South.) The other lesson, though, is that in losing you might transform your party. Ronald Reagan made the full transition to politics by way of Goldwater’s campaign. There is no Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party. (And, thus, less of a firewall against extreme candidates.) It’s not even clear that there’s an “establishment.” And 1964 was a strange election year, in the wake of Kennedy’s assassination. What if Goldwater really was running against Kennedy, whose attraction to crises and vulnerability to scandal are clearer now than they were at the height of his Presidency? Once each party in our system puts forward a candidate, it is a mistake to discount the possibility that anything can happen. Sarah Palin, after all, had a good chance of being second in line for the Presidency in the Administration of a man who is not young.","565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"
"“Ted with nukes, Ted with nukes, let’s see,” Senator Lindsey Graham said on Monday, at the Council on Foreign Relations. He stroked his chin theatrically; the C.F.R. members in the room were already laughing. (I was the moderator at the event, and had asked about his confidence in a President Cruz’s handling of a nuclear crisis.) How about the other possible nominees, including Scott Walker, who has said that his fights with labor unions have prepared him to confront ISIS with nuclear weapons? How would Chris Christie deal with enemy supply-line traffic? The idea of another Bush handling the wars in the Middle East is a less amusing image than Ted with nukes, but it’s still not comforting. There may be many reasons Ted Cruz won’t win, from money to support in key states. But outlandishness alone won’t be enough.","566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"

"In 1964, Nelson Rockefeller, the more moderate Republican, was derailed in part by his complicated personal life. (Jeffrey Frank has written about his career for The New Yorker.) Richard Nixon had earlier decided to run for California Governor and lost, though he’d be back in 1968, to begin a mythic round of dysfunction. There was a brief effort to draft Henry Cabot Lodge II (a figure with certain dynastic parallels to Jeb Bush), but it faded. After the first ballot at the Republican convention, the only candidate left besides Goldwater was Margaret Chase Smith. Although she had hardly campaigned, she’d put her name down, and arrived with twenty-seven delegates. (George Romney had forty-one.) The other challengers stepped aside once Goldwater’s nomination was assured, but she stayed in. If she hadn’t, Goldwater would have won the Republican nomination by unanimous consent.","568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruz-is-not-afraid-to-lose"

Watts, the soon-to-be house bandleader of “The Late Late Show with James Corden,” on CBS, could be called a comedian or a musician. In his signature act, he improvises monologues and songs over beats that he records onstage and loops using an effects pedal.

"The other day, Watts was due at the Tiger Lounge, a secret rehearsal space beneath a dive bar in Williamsburg. The room reeked of incense, its walls covered with graffiti. Watts lumbered in and bellowed to the room, “Hello, I am Lathrup McGillicutty,” but his distinctive hairdo (poufy ’fro, poufy beard) gave him away. He offered a hand to shake—he keeps his pinkie nails long; one was painted red, the other black—and addressed how he’d found the place. “Fifteen years ago, I worked for a small Salisbury-steak TV-dinner-manufacturing company called Swanson’s, and they would include brownies, which would always remain kind of gooey even though you put them in the oven for a long time,” he began. “And I remember my grandmother coming over with a shawl, and she said, ‘You guys look so cozy here, but you know what would really work? You should find a place in New York,’ and so I found this place.” He blinked. His interlocutor laughed nervously. Nah, Watts said, a friend had brought him and he’d dug the vibe. “It reminds me of Seattle, like, 1992,” he said.","570","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/sidekick"

"“Yeah, man,” Watts said. “It’s all natural, Stevia-sweetened, green coffee beans, unroasted, longer prolonged energy, healthier for you. It’s dope. It’s the shit! It’s got electrolytes.” He did not sound like someone who needed more caffeine.","573","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/sidekick"

"Watts abandoned the bug, and talked about his role on “The Late Late Show.” “I don’t really know much about what’s going on. Except that I’m supposed to be coming up with a theme song,” he said. “Hopefully, it’s going to sound like ‘Sanford and Son.’ Or Mumford. One of the ‘and son’s.” His band will have five members. “I’m still looking for a female bass player. I don’t want it to be just a bunch of fucking dudes.

I know a lot about fake talk shows.” Since 2012, Watts has done his thing on the mock late-night show “Comedy Bang! Bang!” Corden, who is British, and is known for the BBC sitcom “Gavin & Stacey,” as well as for starring in “One Man, Two Guvnors” on Broadway, has even less relevant experience.

"“So tired of the same old crud / Sweet baby, I need fresh blood,” go the lyrics to the theme tune of “The Jinx,” Andrew Jarecki’s six-part documentary about Robert Durst, which came to a conclusion on HBO last night. The song, by the rock band the Eels, at first seemed hardly a subtle choice for a series that began by chronicling the investigation of the killing and dismemberment, fifteen years ago, of Morris Black, Durst’s onetime neighbor in Galveston, Texas, and went on to explore Durst’s possible culpability in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathie Durst, in 1982, and the execution of his onetime best friend, Susan Berman, in 2000. Durst, the misanthropic, self-regarding, tic-ridden son of a real-estate tycoon, had sought out Jarecki and offered himself as an interview subject after seeing “All Good Things,” the filmmaker’s fictionalized account of the Dursts’ marriage. He was, the framing of the show suggested, a cold, vampiric psychopath who had yet to be held responsible for his murderous appetites.","March 16, 2015","580","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/robert-dursts-grotesque-confession"
"","581","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/robert-dursts-grotesque-confession"
"By the end of the sixth episode, however, it had become unsettlingly unclear exactly whose taste for blood was being chronicled in “The Jinx,” and whose appetite was being satisfied. The finale was structured around the preparation for a follow-up interview, in which Jarecki was to confront Durst with new evidence that pointed to his guilt in the murder of Susan Berman. The episode had the pace and tone of reality television. There was the breathless use of a “confession cam,” into which Jarecki spoke about his fears for his own safety in light of his growing convictions about Durst’s past. There was also obfuscation of the time line for dramatic effect. In one instance, Chip Lewis, Durst’s lawyer, was seen reacting to a new piece of evidence—an envelope inscribed by Durst that strongly resembles an envelope in which an anonymous note was sent to the L.A. Police Department, alerting them to Susan Berman’s death—before Durst is seen being confronted with it. This seems an unlikely sequence of events, unless Lewis is as bad at being a lawyer as Durst is at being a husband, friend, and neighbor.","582","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/robert-dursts-grotesque-confession"
"The episode, like the rest of the series, was riveting television in the way that footage of a tsunami is riveting: horrific, inexorable, and barely watchable. Seeing Robert Durst willingly acknowledge the first letter, which had been belatedly found in Susan Berman’s effects, and then watching him as Jarecki produced the letter sent to the Los Angeles police was to witness a process of inward disorientation in real time, and to participate in it, too. We are accustomed to watching actors convey the experience of a horribly dawning realization—it’s easy to imagine Ian McKellen playing the role of Durst. But it was quite another thing to find oneself having been induced—willingly, avidly—into witnessing Durst’s appalling recalibration.","583","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/robert-dursts-grotesque-confession"
"Even more shocking was the scene that followed: Durst, still wearing a live mic while going to the bathroom, was overheard talking to himself while urinating: “Killed them all, of course.” The show presented this as Durst’s confession, though the possibility remains that it might have been Durst’s ventriloquism of what he imagined Jarecki’s thought process to be. (It would not be the first time Durst had spoken to Jarecki as if he were a skeptical outside observer of his own defense.) Thus ended the episode, and the show.","584","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/robert-dursts-grotesque-confession"
"When first confronted with the twin letters, Durst belched as if he was about to vomit, and he was surely not the only one made bilious by the scene as it unfolded. (Sickening in a more straightforward manner was the show’s lurid reenactment of Susan Berman’s murder—an actress falling to the ground in sensuous slow motion—which was shown repeatedly, an operatic aestheticization of her death.) Watching “The Jinx” brought to mind the brilliant first episode of the British drama series “Black Mirror”: a Swiftian satire in which the public watches the Prime Minster sexually humiliate himself on television. In a pub, a mob of viewers is moved from titillated vengefulness to pity and then to self-recrimination, appalled by the experience of witnessing what they’d longed to see.","585","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/robert-dursts-grotesque-confession"
"At the same time, the airing of Durst’s sensational bathroom soliloquy raised questions that the show itself declined to answer—the explanations evidently withheld for dramatic, rather than journalistic, reasons. With such a recording in hand, what was Jarecki’s calculus in balancing his self-proclaimed desire to see justice done with his wish, after ten years of research and labor, to make a groundbreaking television show? The claim, in the Times, that Jarecki and his team overlooked the existence of the bathroom recording for two years, seems worthy of a six-part investigation of its own. (The filmmakers, having been quizzed on the time line of events as represented, have cancelled forthcoming interviews.)","586","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/robert-dursts-grotesque-confession"
"Before the finale aired, the news broke that Durst had been arrested in New Orleans and charged with Susan Berman’s murder. It will be up to the lawyers to determine what, if any, of Durst’s actions or statements as recorded by Jarecki will be admissible as evidence. If Durst is finally convicted—if it is determined that a guilty man was entrapped in “The Jinx”—Jarecki will no doubt be congratulated for bringing Durst to justice. Indeed, he already has been: Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester district attorney who investigated the death of Kathie Durst, told the Times that Jarecki and his producer, Marc Smerling, “did what law enforcement in three states could not do in thirty years.”","587","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/robert-dursts-grotesque-confession"
"Meanwhile, those of us who formed the audience for the show are left to contend with our participation in an extralegal spectacle that, against all odds, transformed the unsympathetic Durst into a pitiable quarry. Whatever Durst’s culpability, “The Jinx” became, by the miniseries’ end, a grotesque concatenation in which vigilante investigation was queasily merged with commercial sensationalism. A quarter century ago, Janet Malcolm, in her now classic essay “The Journalist and the Murderer,” characterized the betrayals that were, she argued, inherent in the relationship between a reporter and his or her subject. What our changed times call for is an examination of the complicity that transpires between the producers and the consumers of quasi-journalistic entertainments like “The Jinx.” Because every viewer who is not too stupid or too full of himself to know what was going on knows that what we did was morally indefensible.","588","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/robert-dursts-grotesque-confession"

Right now, though, it’s hard to see how he could challenge the front-runners. Although Rubio was elected to the Senate in 2010 as part of the Tea Party wave, and although he still espouses extreme views on issues like climate change (he’s a skeptic) and same-sex marriage (he opposes it), many people in the conservative movement don’t view him as a true believer. In any case, the right-wing end of the Republican field is very crowded. Rubio’s best hope is probably to position himself as a center-right candidate and hope for a slipup on the part of Jeb Bush, his fellow Floridian.","591","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

"The proximate cause of Rubio’s current problems is well known: his role in co-sponsoring a bipartisan immigration-reform bill that would have established a lengthy pathway to citizenship for law-abiding undocumented immigrants. With the support of Rubio and thirteen other Republicans, the Senate passed the bill in June, 2013. After the bill generated a backlash among conservative and anti-immigration groups and died in the House of Representatives, Rubio backtracked, disavowing the legislation and saying that it wasn’t realistic. But the damage to his reputation on the right had been done. And so, as the race to 2016 began to shape up, Rubio found himself outflanked by other conservative hopefuls, such as Cruz and Walker.","593","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

He’s had some success in this enterprise. “I think that Sen. Rubio has done something that most politicians don’t do,” Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots group, told Politico. “He evaluated what went wrong … [and] is working to make sure he doesn’t make the same mistakes again.

The Republican Party is chockablock with supine politicians of this sort, and that helps to explain why it has lost the popular vote in five of the last six Presidential elections. The thing that made Rubio an exciting figure a few years ago, the reason he landed on the front of Time magazine, was that he seemed to combine youth, a compelling personal story, and conservative views with a willingness to reach out to parts of the electorate that the G.O.P. had neglected, particularly, but not exclusively, Hispanics. Immigration reform was supposed to be the test case for whether the Republican Party could adopt a more pragmatic and inclusive approach, and when it sunk, it took Rubio down with it.","595","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"The bigger story is that this Republican golden boy fell victim to what I refer to as the three-strikes theory of politics. If you look around, you will find that it generally takes not just one or two but three defeats for an unpopular political party to reform itself and abandon the things that made it unpopular. Because of the influence of established politicians, vested interests, and ideology, all democratic parties tend to resist change. Two strikes aren’t enough to overcome this inertia. Only after a third successive beating at the hands of voters can reformers overcome the ideologues and seize control of the party.","596","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"
"Of course, it’s only a theory, and it has its exceptions. But look at what happened to the Democratic Party in the nineteen-eighties. After losing to the Republicans for a third successive time in 1988, Bill Clinton and his business-friendly “New Democrats” gradually gained the upper hand and won the 1992 election. Something similar happened in the United Kingdom, when the Labour Party, after defeats in 1981, 1984, and 1987, jettisoned much of its ideological baggage: its commitments to public ownership, unilateral disarmament, and compulsory trade-union membership. The more recent experience in France, which saw the Socialist Party lose Presidential elections in 1995, 2002, and 2007, isn’t quite as stark, perhaps, in that the current President, François Hollande, could hardly be described as a great departure from previous Socialist leaders. But even Hollande, in the run-up to the 2012 Presidential election, advocated for some policies that had previously been considered off limits, such as raising contributions to the retirement system and making it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers.","597","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

With Rubio now parroting the immigration line laid down by Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, et al., the task of taming the right wing has passed to Bush, who, to his credit, has not yet backed down from his support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for the undocumented.","598","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubio-and-the-three-strikes-theory-of-politics"

Still, compared with the likes of Cruz, Walker, and Carson, he’s practically a Rockefeller Republican. But if you look at the surveys of Republican voters collected on Real Clear Politics that I cited earlier, you will find that Bush is stuck at well under twenty per cent. If you then add together the vote shares of Walker, Cruz, Paul, Carson, and Huckabee, all avowedly conservative candidates, you get a total of 53.1 per cent.

"As I (and many others) have noted, the Obama Administration’s budget for the 2016 fiscal year is essentially a wish list, which has no chance of being enacted in anything like its present form. But that doesn’t mean that it lacks import. In advance of the 2016 Presidential campaign, this budget provides a valuable blueprint for what a moderately progressive economic agenda would look like. And equally, or perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates what a travesty the U.S. tax code is, and how badly it needs overhauling.","February 3, 2015","601","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"Traditionally, tax reform is a cause of the right. That’s largely because corporations and rich people follow the details of taxation closely—or, rather, they hire lobbyists to follow it for them. But what the Obama Administration has grasped, and what its budget proposals reflect, is that changing the tax code, and stripping it of some (or all) the favors it bestows on the wealthy and well connected, should be a great rallying cry for liberals, progressives, and anybody else who takes seriously the notion of equal treatment under the law.","602","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"

"Reading budget documents line by line, which is what I did last night, isn’t the most exciting activity. But it gets you down to the level of detail where the loopholes, the scams, and the lobbyists live. Take Table S-9 in the numbers section, which details how each one of the Administration’s many proposals would affect the deficit over the next ten years. It’s a dry and lengthy set of figures, but also a revealing one.","604","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"In a section of the table headed “Loophole closers,” we learn that taxing the profits earned by hedge funds and private-equity firms as ordinary income would raise more than two billion dollars a year between 2017 and 2021. At the moment, and for reasons that don’t withstand any serious scrutiny, these firms are allowed to categorize much of the profit they generate as “carried interest,” which is taxed at a reduced rate of twenty per cent.","605","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"Now, in a four-trillion-dollar budget, two billion dollars doesn’t seem like a huge amount. But most of the profits that hedge funds and private-equity firms generate are concentrated in a few dozen partnerships, which benefit greatly from the giveaway. For example, it was by taking advantage of this loophole that Mitt Romney, formerly of Bain Capital, was able to pay just fourteen per cent of his 2011 income in federal taxes. If Bain’s profits had been treated as regular income, which in 2011 was taxed at rates of up to thirty-five per cent, Romney’s tax bill would have been much higher.","606","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"Moving up a bit in the table, there is an entry titled “Reforms to capital gains taxation, upper-income tax benefits, and the taxation of financial institutions.” The first proposal—reforming the capital-gains tax—is actually two reforms together. The first would raise the rate that high earners pay on capital gains and dividends, from 23.8 per cent to twenty-eight per cent, which is the rate they paid during the soak-the-rich Reagan Administration. The other reform would eliminate a loophole in the income-tax code that allows heirs to reduce their tax bills.* Known in the industry as the “stepped up basis” loophole, it allows the beneficiaries of estates to estimate the cost basis of their inheritances at current market prices, rather than the prices that were paid for them, often years earlier. Since the value of most investments rises over the years, this loophole can make a huge difference to tax-liability calculations. Eliminating the practice would have a big effect on some inheritances. But since the vast majority of estates fall below the threshold for federal inheritance taxes—$5.4 million in 2015—it would mainly impact the top one per cent, which owns forty per cent of the nation’s wealth.","607","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"Over ten years, these two reforms would raise more than two hundred billion dollars in new tax revenues. For the sake of comparison, that would be more than enough to cover an annual five-hundred-dollar tax credit for second earners, an expansion of the earned-income tax credit to low-paid workers who don’t have children, and more generous tax credits for parents who pay for child care—all proposals contained elsewhere in the budget.","608","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"The budget would also address another way in which wealthy people reduce their tax bills, which is by employing crafty accountants and taking deductions for things like mortgage interest, state taxes, charitable donations, and Cadillac health-care plans. One of the budget proposals that hasn’t received much attention would place limits on the total amount of deductions than can be taken by individuals earning more than two hundred thousand dollars a year and couples earning more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. To most ordinary people, taking deductions is a way of saving a few bucks. But for the very rich the sums involved are enormous. Once again, Table S-9 tells the tale. In placing limits on deductions for high earners, the budget would raise more than six hundred billion dollars over ten years. That’s more than enough to pay for all of the tax breaks contained in the budget that are aimed at the middle class. In fact, it would pay for them twice, with about fifty billion dollars left over.","609","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"
"I could go on, addressing the whole issue of corporate loopholes. The picture should already be clear, though. After decades of money politics and anti-tax ideology, the U.S. tax code is festooned with giveaways to the rich and powerful. In seeking to eliminate some of these blights straight away, the 2016 budget seems destined to fail. But in highlighting some of what’s wrong, and showing how it could be remediated, the budget will help to shape the political agenda for years to come. And that makes putting it out a very worthwhile exercise.","610","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/us-tax-code-travesty"

"The brief apparition of a third Mitt Romney Presidential bid vanished last Friday, with a conference call to several of his supporters. “You can’t imagine how hard it is for Ann and me to step aside,” Romney told them. He added that he thought he would have won the Republican nomination again, and that he’d had the “best chance,” this time, to win the Presidency. There was a surprising reason for this optimism, which he had alluded to a couple of weeks earlier, during a speech at the Republican National Committee’s winter meeting, on board the U.S.S. Midway. Despite his previous campaigns, people had not come to know the real Mitt Romney. He had been seen “as a business guy and a political guy.” Neither of those identities had worked—perhaps, although he didn’t say so, because they weren’t consistent with each other or with his record. Ann Romney, however, saw how he had “served as a pastor for a congregation and for groups of congregations,” a reference to his work as a lay bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If voters didn’t know this side of him, it was largely because he and his advisers had treated his Mormon faith as a liability, hardly to be spoken of, in part out of fear that it would alienate evangelicals in the Party’s base. But now Romney seemed ready to be the religious guy. “That’s the authentic Mitt,” a family friend in Utah told the Washington Post. The report added that members of Romney’s political circle “said they are considering making Salt Lake City, the cradle of Mormonism, his 2016 campaign headquarters.”","612","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"As it turned out, Romney’s faith and his sense of mission may have been most useful in explaining why he’d entertained the idea of what even many Republicans saw as an exercise in futility. Yet one aspect of it is worth examining further, owing to its implications for his Party. In his R.N.C. speech, Romney mentioned his pastoral work “with people who are very poor, to get them help and subsistence,” and he said that Republicans had to position themselves as opponents of inequality if they were to win the White House. He may be right, but it will be hard for the G.O.P. to shake the sense that Romney was being more true to his party’s principles three years ago when he said, of the so-called forty-seven per cent, “I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.” This is a Republican dilemma, not a Mormon one.","613","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"Indeed, other potential G.O.P. candidates are now having to recalculate how another religion figures into the equation. There has never been a Catholic Republican nominee for the White House (the Mormons, interestingly, got there first), although there may be one this year, with a field that includes Rick Santorum, Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush, who converted to Catholicism, his wife’s faith, some twenty years ago. For them, the issue is not one of religious bigotry, such as John F. Kennedy faced in his 1960 campaign, with insinuations of adherence to secret Papist instructions. In a way, it’s the opposite: the very public agenda of the all too authentic Pope Francis.","614","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"Early signs of trouble came in the summer of 2013, when the new Pope, speaking with reporters about gays in the Church, asked, “Who am I to judge?” The conservative wing of the Party had relied on his predecessors to do just that. Then he proved much less reticent about issuing a verdict on capitalism. In an apostolic exhortation issued at the end of 2013, he labelled trickle-down economic theories “crude and naïve.” The problems of the poor, he said, had to be “radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality.” That went quite a ways beyond the sort of tepid proposals for job creation and “family formation” that Romney made on the Midway, and the response from Republicans has involved a certain amount of rationalization. “The guy is from Argentina—they haven’t had real capitalism,” Paul Ryan, Romney’s former running mate, and a Catholic, said.","615","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"“It’s sometimes very difficult to listen to the Pope,” Santorum noted last month, after Francis, in remarks about “responsible parenting”—widely interpreted as an opening for a discussion on family planning—said that there was no need for Catholics to be “like rabbits.” Santorum echoed Ryan’s suggestion that Argentine exceptionalism might be at work: “I don’t know what the Pope was referring to there. Maybe he’s speaking to people in the Third World.” On that front, when it emerged that Francis had been instrumental in the diplomatic breakthrough with Cuba, Jeb Bush criticized the deal, and Senator Marco Rubio, also a Catholic, said that he’d like the Pope to “take up the cause of freedom and democracy.”","616","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"As if all that weren’t enough, His Holiness is preparing an encyclical on climate change, to be released in advance of his visit to the United States later this year. In January, he said of global warming, “For the most part, it is man who continuously slaps down nature.” Stephen Moore, of the Heritage Foundation, has written, “On the environment, the pope has allied himself with the far left.” Actually, Francis is very much in the center in terms of scientific opinion, but the leading potential G.O.P. contenders, with the possible exception of Christie, sit somewhere on the climate-change-denial-passivity spectrum—Jeb Bush has said that he is a “skeptic” as to whether the problem is man-made.","617","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"In recent decades, liberal Catholic politicians were the ones with a papal problem; both Mario Cuomo and John Kerry had to reckon with the prospect of excommunication for their support of abortion-rights laws. John Paul II, meanwhile, was a favorite of conservatives; despite his often subtle views, he became at times little more than a symbol of anti-Communism and a certain set of social strictures. He cemented an alliance, in the political realm, between conservative Catholics and evangelicals. (Rubio also attends an evangelical church.) Abortion was a significant part of that story. By contrast, the Franciscan moment will push some Republican candidates to make decisions and to have conversations that they would rather avoid.","618","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"
"It will also offer a chance to address the knotty American idea that faith is an incontrovertible component of political authenticity. (Why is the Romney who thinks about God the “real” one?) The corollary should be that nothing is as inauthentic as faith that is only opportunistically professed, something that this Pope, who has extended a hand to atheists, seems to know. Still, the campaign will be defined not by theological questions but by political ones, prominent among them inequality and climate change. Both can have spiritual dimensions and speak to moral issues, such as our obligations to one another. But neither can be solved by faith alone. ♦","619","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/god-g-o-p"

This is the first good argument that I’ve heard for making the New Hampshire and Iowa contests even earlier. Someone needs to sort out who is clumsy and who is absurd, who is semi-serious and who is wholly alarming; the Republican base isn’t going to do that on its own.

"Expectations were high this past fall for Matt Bai’s book “All the Truth Is Out: The Week Politics Went Tabloid.” Bai is a former Times political reporter and a current national political columnist for Yahoo, and his book zeroed in on a turning point in American political journalism, now largely forgotten: the way the press pursued Gary Hart, the leading Democratic candidate for President in the 1988 campaign, about his sex life. Reporters staked out his home to learn if he was sleeping with Donna Rice, a model; they asked whether he had ever committed adultery; and they investigated that very question. This process, Bai claimed, turned reporters into character cops, fundamentally changing the way the press covered campaigns. Instead of probing the substance of Hart’s positions, he said, reporters chased him from the race. Much of the political press turned into a supermarket tabloid.","January 27, 2015","630","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"","631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"“It’s a story,” Bai writes near the start of his book, “of the moment when the worlds of public service and tabloid entertainment, which had been gradually orbiting closer to one another, finally collided, and of the man who found himself improbably trapped in that collision, and of the way that moment reverberated through the years.”","632","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"Bai’s book is brisk and compelling. It was featured on the cover of the Times magazine last fall. Reviews, especially those composed by academics, were positive. He appeared on “The Daily Show” and “Charlie Rose.” Amazon editors chose it as one of the best books of the year. His publisher, Knopf, ordered a first printing of twenty-five thousand copies. Yet sales fizzled, totalling just ten thousand, according to a knowledgeable publishing source. Journalists, it seems, did not want to reflect on the way their profession had changed, and the public didn’t seem so interested either in the moral questions Bai raised. A publishing executive who is a fan of Bai’s book asked me, “Do you really think the press will warm to a book that criticizes the press?”","633","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"Members of the media have often justified their investigations into Hart by noting that the candidate invited them to snoop. “Follow me around,” Hart once said. “I don’t care. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They’d be very bored.” But, as Bai shows, that well-known quote was taken out of context. Furthermore, it did not appear until after the Miami Herald, which published the first stories about Donna Rice, had staked out his D.C. home and cornered him in an alley.","634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"The book paints a vivid picture of a feral pack of reporters out to beat the Herald’s scoop. It particularly notes the moment, a short while after the Miami Herald story appeared, that Paul Taylor, a respected reporter from the Washington Post, asked Hart at a crowded New Hampshire press conference, “Have you ever committed adultery?”","635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"Bai described the reaction to this query. “To Hart and his aides and to the older reporters in the room who would always remember it as a watershed moment, Taylor might as well have asked him to disrobe right there and submit to a cavity search,” he wrote. “No reporter had ever asked a presidential candidate that kind of personal, sexual, broad question.”","636","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"While Bai is tough on Taylor and the principal political reporter for the Miami Herald, Tom Fiedler, he also scrupulously offers their defense, and he provides some context for why the press had legitimate concerns about Hart’s character: Nixon had lied about Watergate, and Lyndon Johnson had lied about Vietnam. But Bai also shows how, after Watergate, reportorial skepticism curdled into cynicism, and how some journalists became as ambitious as the candidates, hoping to become the next Bob Woodward or Carl Bernstein. Bai expresses admiration for Hart’s efforts to publicly question the press’s behavior, and he defends a candidate’s right to demand a zone of privacy.","637","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"Serious questions have been raised about Bai’s book. Thomas E. Patterson, the Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press at Harvard’s Kennedy School, wrote in an e-mail, “As far as its thesis, I both agree and disagree.” The Hart campaign was, Patterson said, a watershed, and it did set up the press’s coverage of Bill Clinton. But he also notes that tough personal questions, such as those about Geraldine Ferraro’s tax returns, had been asked before the Hart campaign. He added, “I think Matt is right in looking at the Hart case as definitive in terms of signalling that candidates’ private lives are fair game.”","638","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"Tom Rosenstiel, who inspected the media’s coverage of the Hart campaign for the Los Angeles Times, and who today serves as the executive director of the nonprofit American Press Institute, told me that he believes Bai minimizes the legitimate questions reporters had about Hart. As a candidate, Rosenstiel said, Hart was “pious,” presenting himself as someone “who wanted to bring virtue to public life”; yet journalists worried about his “reckless” behavior and the “blind spots” in his character. What animated reporters who covered Hart, Rosenstiel said, “had less to do with Hart’s fidelity to his wife than with, ‘You say you’re this kind of person, yet you conduct yourself differently.’ ”","639","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"Sometimes there are good reasons to report on the sex lives of politicians. The tabloid National Enquirer revealed much about John Edwards’s character, in 2008, when it exposed his adulterous affair, as well as his blatant lies about paternity, as his wife died of cancer. While there were egregious excesses in the press coverage of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, there’s no way reporters could ignore that the President of the United States had had an affair with a White House intern and publicly lied about it. Or that the former Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller had suffered a fatal heart attack, in 1979, while having sex with a woman who was not his wife, or that his staff had at first induced reporters to file false stories about the incident.","640","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"Perhaps Hart would have imploded anyway. “There were lots of things about Hart that may have made him a problematic candidate,” Rosenstiel said. The candidate was as intellectually sharp as Bill Clinton, and his innovative ideas have had lasting impact. But a President is in our living rooms daily, and “likeability” matters. Hart’s intensity, aloofness, and admirable sense of privacy won respect, not warmth, Rosenstiel said. Reporters were right to note that Hart was a loner, and that few of his colleagues in the Senate supported him for President. This posed the same question for Hart as it does today for Obama or for Elizabeth Warren: choosing a President involves more than just going through an ideological checklist. Whether candidates also have the political and executive skills—and the patience—to manage a giant enterprise and build a consensus to advance their agendas is equally important.","641","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"Bai’s superb book provokes many questions, and I gulped it down in a single sitting. Perhaps the reason that the book didn’t sell, a well-placed publishing executive told me, is because Hart is ancient history, and books on the press are perceived by readers as inside baseball. But the other reason, it seems to me, is that thin-skinned journalists have less interest in reading, and writing, about their own mistakes.","642","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"
"Bai had extensive access to Hart, and as I neared the end of the book I wondered, will he ask Hart the question of whether he committed adultery? I’ve heard more than a few reporters lambast Bai for writing an entire book without asking Hart whether he had sex with Rice. But those who ask that question miss the lesson that Bai meant to impart. The most poignant and powerful moment in the book comes near the end, when Bai explains why he chose not to ask. To ask would have contradicted everything he wrote in two hundred and forty-six pages. After two years of reporting, he had decided that, while Hart was flawed, the candidate’s refusal to answer prurient questions showed true strength of character.","643","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/media-doesnt-want-remember-gary-hart"

"“President Obama abdicated his responsibility to uphold the United States Constitution when he attempted to circumvent the laws passed by Congress via executive fiat, and Judge Hanen’s decision rightly stops the President’s overreach in its tracks,” Greg Abbott, the new Republican governor of Texas, said in a statement hailing the ruling. “The District Court’s ruling is very clear—it prevents the President from implementing the policies in ‘any and all aspects.’ ” Late last year, when Abbott was serving as the state attorney general, he filed a lawsuit in which Texas and sixteen other states challenged the President’s announcement that the federal government would no longer seek to deport undocumented parents of children born in the United States—a policy shift that would have lifted the threat of forced removal from about four million people. (The number of states involved in the suit eventually rose to twenty-six, mostly G.O.P. run.) Ted Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, echoed Abbott’s comments, saying, “The Texas court decision … is a major turning point in the fight to stop Obama’s lawless amnesty…. Last summer, we saw a humanitarian crisis on our southern border that was a direct consequence of Obama’s previous amnesty. Republicans are now standing together to try to insure that it never happens again.”","646","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"

"If that last sentence was a shout-out to Judge Hanen, who was appointed to the bench in 2002, it was surely justified. Known in Texas as a vigorous enforcer of immigration laws, Hanen, contrary to Abbott’s suggestion, was careful not to get drawn into the question of whether President Obama has the constitutional authority to enact a big change in immigration policy without the approval of Congress. As I pointed out when Obama initially announced the plan, last November, most legal experts believed that the White House was on firm ground, constitutionally speaking.","648","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Rather than ruling on whether Obama violated the Constitution, Hanen based his opinion, which runs to a hundred and twenty-three pages, on a much narrower issue: Did the Department of Homeland Security, in preparing to enact the President’s policy change, fully follow the laws governing the introduction of important new administrative rules by federal agencies? No, Hanen said, and argued that by failing to provide for a public comment period about the new deportation procedures, in which interested parties could register their support or their concerns, the department had violated the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Therefore, the new procedures had to be halted before they went into effect.","649","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"On the basis of this narrow ruling, immigration policy is now on hold for an indefinite period. The Administration’s appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, could take many months to resolve, and whichever way that court rules the case may well go all the way to the Supreme Court. If D.H.S. decides to hold public hearings about the new policy, as Hanen says it should have done, it could take up to a year.","650","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"In Washington, where every day provides another opportunity to wage partisan warfare, twelve months is an eternity. The ruling had barely been issued when attention shifted to the battle du jour, which just happens to be over immigration reform and the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. Fearful that the new rules about deportations would go into effect before Hanen or anybody else had a chance to stop them, the Republicans have been threatening to defund the entire department unless the new funding bill includes measures designed to gut immigration reforms. Democrats, relying on a filibuster, have refused to allow such a proposal to advance.","651","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"On the basis of what passes for common sense outside the Beltway, you might suspect that the Republicans, once Judge Hanen had done their work for them, would declare victory and move onto other issues. But no. “We will continue to follow the case as it moves through the legal process,” Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. “Hopefully, Senate Democrats who claim to oppose this executive overreach will now let the Senate begin debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security department.” Translated into English, this means that Republicans are still threatening to close down the department at the end of next week if they don’t get their way. Or, in the words of Ted Cruz, “At a time when we face grave national-security threats, at home and abroad, it is the height of irresponsibility for the Democrats to block this funding in an extreme attempt to save Obama’s amnesty, which a federal judge has just declared illegal.”","652","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Only in the upside-down world of Washington does refusing to accept “you win” as an answer make sense. Boehner may have been reëlected handily at the start of the year, but he still needs the support of rank-and-file G.O.P. members, many of whom campaigned vigorously against any suggestion of amnesty for the undocumented. Just a few weeks into a new term, the Speaker can’t risk being outflanked on the right. And so it’s onward into battle.","653","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"It barely needs saying that, from a longer-term perspective, the Republicans’ attitude toward immigration policy is mightily self-destructive. If they shut down the Department of Homeland Security, an arm of government that a Republican President created to protect the citizenry from terrorist attacks, the public backlash will be immediate and savage. And if Republicans, in the months ahead, stick with a posture toward undocumented immigrants that Hispanics and other minority groups perceive as unremittingly hostile, they will be gravely undermining their prospects in 2016. The hopes of the Democratic candidate, whether it is Hillary Clinton or somebody else, rest on getting a big turnout. And in Hispanic areas, there is no surer way of generating a big turnout than by stoking concerns about immigration policy.","654","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Many Republicans know this, of course. Jeb Bush, reacting to Judge Hanen’s ruling on his Facebook page (which serves as the principal communication vehicle for his nascent campaign), sought to shift the blame to Obama, accusing him of overstepping his authority and failing the leadership test. “The millions of families affected across the country deserve better,” Bush said. “Now, more than ever, we need President Obama to work with Congress to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system.”","655","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"The G.O.P. front-runner will need to do better than that. Back in June, 2013, the Senate, with the encouragement and involvement of the White House, passed a comprehensive immigration bill that had the support of fourteen Republicans, including John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio. The legislation included funds for twenty thousand new border-patrol agents and seven hundred miles of electric fencing. And it provided a convoluted, thirteen-year pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who could show that they had obeyed the law and paid their taxes. It died in the House of Representatives, and eventually the White House looked for a way to do an end-run around Congress.","656","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"If Boehner and his colleagues resurrected and passed the Senate bill tomorrow, Obama would sign it in an instant. It’s not going to happen, of course, and that’s why Hanen’s ruling, although it has given Republicans something to cheer about, could end up helping to deprive them of the White House. If the new deportation system were to go into effect as planned, it would have been up and running for more than eighteen months come Election Day, and there wouldn’t have been any real prospect of it being reversed. Like Obamacare, another Republican hate object, it would have become a fact on the ground.","657","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"

"Walmart is famously the world’s largest employer among publicly traded corporations, but there’s another statistic about the company that makes its influence on the lives of working people especially clear: in the U.S., about one in a hundred employed people work there. Many of them—hundreds of thousands of people—earn the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty-five cents an hour, or close to it. When Walmart adjusts its wages or other labor practices, the change is thought to have a ripple effect: other employers, which must compete with Walmart to attract workers, can often be compelled to change their own policies, too. So, not surprisingly, working at Walmart has long been a kind of proxy, in conversations about labor practices, for low-wage toil.","February 20, 2015","659","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/real-reasons-walmarts-wage-hike"

"Such conversations have received more attention in the past couple of years, partly because they speak to a problem—stagnant wages—that has been acknowledged, even by conservative economists and policymakers, as a serious one. When the recession ended, the unemployment rate began falling to pre-recession levels, and economists predicted that a tighter supply of workers would soon send wages up, too, as has historically happened. But, puzzlingly to some observers, that didn’t happen; since the end of the recession, wages have increased at about the same rate as inflation, even as G.D.P. has grown far more quickly, which means that an hour of work in 2015 is worth about as much, in terms of buying power, as an hour of work in 2009.","661","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/real-reasons-walmarts-wage-hike"
"There are various possible reasons for this—among them, that the federal minimum wage hasn’t changed since 2009, and that membership in unions, which allow workers to bargain collectively for higher wages, has fallen over the years—but whatever the cause, the wage problem has emerged as one of the central economic quandaries of the post-recession era. On Thursday, the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group, published a report showing that wages haven’t risen. “The stagnation of hourly wages is the most important economic issue facing most American families, and most of our key economic challenges hinge on whether or not hourly wages for the vast majority grow,” the author, Elise Gould, wrote.","662","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/real-reasons-walmarts-wage-hike"
"Coincidentally, the report came out on the same day that the C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillon, announced, in a quarterly conference call with analysts and investors, that by this time next year all current Walmart employees will be paid at least ten dollars an hour—two dollars and seventy-five cents higher than the federal minimum wage—and that people who are newly hired by Walmart will start at nine dollars an hour, with the chance to make ten dollars an hour after a six-month training period. McMillon, surely aware that his immediate audience consisted largely of investors, framed the wage increase in the context of Walmart’s over-all business; better-paid employees are more satisfied, he suggested, and satisfied workers make for more satisfied customers. “Over all, these are strategic investments in our people to reignite the sense of ownership they have in our stores,” he said.","663","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/real-reasons-walmarts-wage-hike"
"Of course, any employer’s decision to raise wages is a complicated one; if it weren’t, Walmart would have made the move a long time ago. Some of the company’s competitors have also raised their wages, putting pressure on Walmart to keep up or risk losing workers; last year, for instance, the Gap announced that it would increase its starting hourly wage to ten dollars an hour. There are economic factors at work, too: in the past couple of months, as gas prices have fallen, people have been spending more money elsewhere—a fact that can persuade employers to do more hiring, particularly in areas like retail, which can in turn lead to higher wages as the supply of workers gets tighter and employers are forced to pay more to attract employees.","664","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/real-reasons-walmarts-wage-hike"
"Walmart’s decision has reignited a perennial topic of political debate: Does the free market, left to its own devices, compel employers to set appropriate wages? After Walmart’s announcement, Michael Saltsman, the research director of the right-leaning Employment Policies Institute, which opposes government-mandated minimum-wage increases, wrote that the decision “exemplifies how wages rise in a free economy: by choice, not by government mandate,” adding that Walmart’s choice to move to a ten-dollar base wage “does not mean it should be mandated for all other businesses, regardless of industry or size.” In a press release, the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group that has called for wages of fifteen dollars an hour, gave credit to ongoing protests by workers themselves. The president of the National Retail Federation, a lobbying group, said that Walmart’s decision to proactively increase wages is evidence that minimum-wage hikes are “unnecessary.”","665","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/real-reasons-walmarts-wage-hike"
"Of course, Walmart’s move—just like ones made by the Gap and others—didn’t come out of nowhere. By the time Walmart voluntarily raises its wages next year, California, where the company employs more workers than in nearly any other state, will already have a statewide ten-dollar minimum wage in place, making the state’s minimum wage the highest in the nation, along with Massachusetts’s. Pressured by minimum-wage workers and activists, and in the absence of a federal minimum-wage hike, other states have also recently raised their minimum wages above the federal level. State minimum-wage increases, not to mention several city minimum-wage hikes, were surely part of the corporate calculus behind Walmart’s decision.","666","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/real-reasons-walmarts-wage-hike"
"It’s still not clear how Walmart’s announcement will influence other retailers—that is, how any copycat wage increases would compare with increases guaranteed to come with government-mandated minimum-wage hikes. A great deal of research has been conducted on the impact of such increases, though much of it is funded by labor groups that support them or by business groups that oppose them. (Some research has been funded by the federal government, too: the Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that an increase in the federal minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour would increase wages for low-income workers, on average, but would also lower U.S. employment anywhere from “a slight decrease” to a decline of a million jobs.) But it is far more difficult to find studies on the ripple effects of decisions by big employers to change their wage policies in the absence of a government mandate. In fact, some economists don’t expect much change at all, partly because so many other retailers already pay more than Walmart does. “This isn’t going to move the needle much,” the chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank told the Wall Street Journal. One in a hundred workers is a lot of affected people, to be sure, but a federally mandated minimum wage would apply to a hundred in a hundred.","667","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/real-reasons-walmarts-wage-hike"

Sometimes it comes from other people, like the people who pick things up and then leave them in totally random places around the IKEA store.

"When people make a joke, what they are doing is combining words and/or images in ways that are intended to surprise you a little. They may even surprise you a lot. These surprises make us laugh because we weren’t expecting them, and we involuntarily react by laughing when we are released from a state of not knowing what is about to come.

Also, it was a current-events joke, and he’s a fictional character from the nineteen-fifties, so he didn’t get it, even though it was really funny, I swear.

More specifically, he wants to increase the tax rate on capital gains for high earners, from 23.5 per cent to twenty-eight per cent, and he also wants to remove the so-called “step up in basis” loophole, which allows rich families to reduce, often greatly, the amount of taxes they pay on their estates. The money generated by these changes would be used for a variety of purposes, including a modest tax cut for middle-class married couples, an expansion in wage subsidies to low-paid workers, and an expansion of tax credits for students in higher education.","684","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"This is a good plan.

"Of course, with the Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, the chances of the proposals being enacted anytime soon are practically nil. Speaker John Boehner immediately dismissed them as old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberalism. Since the plan isn’t going anywhere, it’s perhaps tempting to dismiss it as meaningless. But that would be an error. Simply advocating tax cuts for the masses will reshape the politics of the next couple of years, and, particularly, the 2016 Presidential election.","686","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, assuming she gets the nomination, will come under pressure to match and top the White House proposals. After all, she can hardly run for President while saying that her big idea is to carry out a plan proposed by her predecessor. I would be willing to wager that Clinton, or any other Democratic candidate, will subsume the President’s proposals in a bigger and bolder plan to help the sagging middle class. And there is plenty of room to expand upon Obama’s ideas. In a seventeen-and-a-half-trillion-dollar economy, thirty-two billion dollars a year, on average—which is roughly the sum that tax hikes and a new levy on big banks would raise, according to Obama Administration officials—is a very modest sum. In fact, it’s equivalent to only about a fifth of one per cent of G.D.P. Any Democratic candidate who is flying around the country talking about the need to offset decades of rampant growth in inequality will surely be tempted to increase the stakes.","687","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But perhaps the most interesting aspect of Obama’s plan is what it augurs for the G.O.P. nomination fight. To be sure, there’s very little chance that any of the Republican candidates will embrace the idea of raising tax levies on the rich. Many of those expected to run have signed Grover Norquist’s pledge never to raise taxes under any circumstances; reneging would plunge them into an unholy war with the right. “Raising taxes on people that are successful is not going to make people that are struggling more successful,” Senator Marco Rubio, who also appeared on “Face the Nation,” said. “The good news about free enterprise is that everyone can succeed without punishing anyone.”","688","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But just because Rubio and his fellow Presidential hopefuls won’t support the first half of Obama’s plan doesn’t mean they can’t embrace the tax-cutting half. To the contrary, it’s easy to imagine middle-class tax cuts emerging as a central issue in the G.O.P. primaries, with the candidates vying to outdo one another. And, unlike Hillary and her economic advisers, the G.O.P. hopefuls are unlikely to be overly concerned with how to pay for the giveaways they propose.","689","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Such unconcern would represent a bit of a change. Ever since the Great Recession sent the budget deficit soaring to ten per cent of G.D.P., Republicans have struggled to reconcile their old Reaganite religion of supply-side economics with their claims that Obama was bankrupting the country. When Mitt Romney, in 2012, said that he would cut everybody’s taxes by twenty per cent without raising the deficit, but didn’t identify spending cuts, his plan was widely ridiculed. Famously, the Tax Policy Center, a recognized non-partisan authority on such matters, described the proposals as “mathematically impossible”—a judgment from which Romney’s campaign struggled to recover.","690","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But the economic environment is changing, which means that the political environment is also shifting—and not in the direction that tends to prompt concern for fiscal responsibility. In fiscal 2014, which ended on October 1st, the deficit was just 2.8 per cent of G.D.P. That means that it is nearly back to its average level over the past forty years. With G.D.P. growth buoyant, the deficit is likely to fall further this year. When deficits are low, they begin to recede from the public consciousness, and charges of fiscal recklessness carry less heft.","691","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Neither party has fully adjusted to this new reality. Obama’s plan is a model of financial rectitude: modest tax cuts and spending programs financed by clearly identified increases in taxes and fees. That’s very laudable. However, recent history suggests that Washington, except in an economic crisis, doesn’t operate in this way. As deficits fall, the temptation to introduce another big tax cut often becomes overwhelming.","692","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"The Democrats may try to resist the temptation. Al Gore did so in 2000. But if Hillary, or another Democratic candidate, is serious about introducing tax and spending programs that would make a serious dent in wage stagnation and inequality, she (or he) will be faced with the choice of introducing bigger tax increases on the rich than Obama is proposing, or forgoing tax hikes and making some optimistic projections about the deficit. With the Republicans ever eager to portray the Democrats as inveterate tax-raisers, the choice will be a tricky one.","693","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"

Jeb Bush has, in the past, positioned himself as a deficit hawk, even suggesting that he would be willing to accept modest tax increases in return for big spending cuts. As the primaries approach, will he stick to that position? Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee have both endorsed a flat tax. Rubio, together with Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, recently proposed a two-tier tax system in which most people would pay a rate of just fifteen per cent. Romney, if he does run, will doubtless have another tax-cutting scheme in his pocket.

Diminish stock prices,” the President said, summoning his most dismissive tone. “The stock market has doubled since I came into office. Corporate profits are—corporate balance sheets are stronger than they have ever been—because of my terrible business policies.” At this point, Obama was interrupted by laughter, but he was only getting started. “One Republican senator claimed we faced trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see,” he went on. “Another predicted my reëlection would spike gas prices to $6.60 a gallon.

"Even accounting for the roughly five million jobs that were lost during the Great Recession and its aftermath, about seven million more Americans now have work than when the President took office, in January, 2009. The budget deficit sits at 2.8 per cent of G.D.P., less than it was in the last year of the Bush Administration, when it was 3.1 per cent. Stock prices and corporate profits, as Obama pointed out, have never been higher. To be sure, he didn’t create the surge in U.S. energy production that prompted Saudi Arabia to let the price of oil plummet, thereby putting smiles on the faces of American motorists. But nor did he do anything to prevent it, despite calls from environmentalists to do so. Republican claims that his policies would send gas prices soaring turned out to be wrong, and it was fair for Obama to remind people of that fact.","700","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"In short, the President has earned his lap of honor, even if he is taking it a bit early. He seemed to speak with a purpose that went beyond grandstanding, though, which came through when he called out Republicans for their dogged refusal to move with the times. “Their theory does not change,” he said. “It really doesn’t. It’s a theory that says, ‘If we do little more than just cut taxes for those at the very top, if we strip out regulations and let special interests write their own rules, prosperity trickles down to the rest of us.’ ”","701","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"Perhaps Obama was laying it on a bit thick. But in highlighting Republican obstreperousness, he was also highlighting the political reality in Washington and laying down some foundations for the 2016 Presidential race. For all the talk of a new generation of “reformicons” emerging within the G.O.P. to advocate for new thinking on economic policy, and despite some Republican politicians acknowledging that they need to have something to say about income stagnation and rising inequality, the bulk of the Party—and that includes most its candidates for 2016—seems to be stuck in a Reaganite time warp.","702","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"Exhibit A: Jeb Bush. Speaking in Detroit last month, the former Florida governor made an early pitch to middle-class voters, saying, “Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin. And many more feel like they’re stuck in place: Working longer, and harder, even as they’re losing ground.” But Bush didn’t present any new policy proposals, and, speaking in South Carolina on Tuesday, he said he’s in favor of abolishing the federal minimum wage, arguing that the existence of a national wage floor makes it “harder and harder for the first rung of the ladder to be reached, particularly for young people, particularly for people that have less education.”","703","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"Now, declaring opposition to minimum-wage laws—or proposing leaving them to the states, which seems to be what Bush is calling for—isn’t an outlandish position for a G.O.P. Presidential candidate to take. Indeed, ever since 1962, when Milton Friedman argued, in his book “Capitalism and Freedom,” that the consequences of minimum-wage laws “are precisely the opposite of those intended by the men of good will who support it,” this has been a point of agreement among conservative Republicans. But that’s Obama’s point: The Republicans don’t change. They just reheat the old sauce.","704","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"

"That means it’s mathematically impossible, not politically impossible—although, with Obama in the White House, it’s that too. The new proposal incorporates big tax cuts skewed toward the rich, unspecified cuts in spending, flaky revenue estimates, and a massive and implausible overhaul of Medicaid and Medicare—not to mention the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. It closely resembles previous Republican budgets that weren’t serious tax-and-spending proposals either, but broad political manifestoes hewed out of the tattered old doctrine of supply-side economics.","706","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"
"In his speech in Cleveland, Obama made fun of this, too. He recalled how one Republican had told him that “she couldn’t agree with me more that we need to be helping working moms and dads more. Another wrote a policy memo saying that Republicans must define themselves as the party of the American worker, the party of higher wages.” The problem the Republicans have, the President went on, is that “the rhetoric doesn’t match the reality. The walk doesn’t sync up with the talk. And all you have to do is look at the budget that House Republicans put forward just yesterday,” which “doubles-down on trickle down.”","707","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-well-earned-victory-lap-on-the-economy"

"Jeb Bush, who is “actively exploring” a Presidential run in 2016, has come under fire for a 2009 Miami-Dade County voter-registration application in which he identified himself as Hispanic. The Times has a photocopy of the document, which requires an original signature next to an oath declaring “that all information provided in this application is true.” A spokeswoman could offer no explanation for the error, but the most likely one is that it gives new meaning to the term “honest mistake.” Bush has a long history of identifying with and immersing himself in the Hispanic community. His wife, Columba, is Mexican-born, and his three children are mixed-race. But, as the media was quick to remind Bush (who was born in Texas, to two exceedingly American parents, George and Barbara), ethnic identities are not exactly elective.","April 6, 2015","709","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"

"Back in August of 2012, we were given a glimpse of Bush’s own discomfort with using his connection to the Hispanic community, in a sitdown interview conducted in Spanish by Jorge Ramos, of Univision. The two men discuss the Republican Party’s stance on immigration, which leads Ramos to ask about using Hispanic identification to one’s electoral advantage. Ramos cites Bush’s eldest son (who would later be elected Texas land commissioner, in a landslide) as an example, saying, “Your son, George P. Bush, he is Latino, right? He considers himself Latino? Because, of course, his mother, Columba, is Mexican.” (CNN’s John King once misidentified her as Colombian.) Bush replies with great pride, “Exactly.” But, as Ramos continues, Bush’s smile droops—he sees where he’s going next, with a more ambiguous example. Ramos says, “Governor Romney, his father is Mexican, he was born in Mexico, the laws say that he is Mexican.” Yes, Bush assents, and here he begins to look uncomfortable. “But he doesn’t consider himself Latino, nor does he put much emphasis on his Latino origin.” The camera catches Bush straining, confusingly both nodding and then shaking his head. Ramos then asks whether Romney’s reluctance to use his ties to Mexico might lose him some votes. Bush shrugs, and says, “I don’t know, I don’t know,” but one has the sense that he does—Romney ended up losing the Hispanic vote to Obama by a margin of seventy-one per cent to twenty-seven per cent.","711","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"At a Hispanic Leadership Network conference in Miami in 2013, the former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, who is a Cuban-born Republican, described Jeb Bush as “just as Hispanic as everyone in this room, and maybe a little more.” He was embellishing the truth, but not by much—Bush married Columba Garnica de Gallo, in 1974, after meeting her four years earlier while on a school trip to Mexico. He studied Latin American affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, and he and Columba lived in Caracas, Venezuela, for two years before settling down in Florida, where he began a long career in Republican politics. But does any of this make him more or less Hispanic than Elizabeth Warren is Native American? (He’s still more Hispanic than Romney, which is still not at all.)","712","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"Bush speaks fluent, near-effortless Spanish as the result of his long-term life choices rather than as part of an effort to win Hispanic votes (a political tactic I have previously called “Hispandering”). As a result, the Spanish-language media is taking him seriously as a candidate who might appeal to Latino voters. Earlier this year, on his Sunday morning talk show, “Al Punto,” Ramos told Gutierrez, “For the first time in history, we have two Hispanic candidates from the Republican Party”—Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz—and, with a good-natured shrug of his shoulders, he added, “and Jeb Bush, if we want to convert him to Latino as well!” Gutierrez responded, “I think it’s very good that we have Hispanics, but there are different types of Hispanics.” He wasn’t referring to Caribbean versus Central American Hispanics, or the difference between Mexicans and Chicanos. He said he preferred not to compare Cruz (a Canadian-born Cuban-American) with Rubio (an American-born Cuban), because the latter is more moderate and the former is on the extreme right. His Goldilocks candidate is the effectively Hispanic Jeb Bush, whose policies he says he knows and likes best. Like many centrists, Bush supports comprehensive immigration reform—legal status and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants—and has distanced himself from the Tea Party extremism of calls for sealing borders. He said in 2013 that immigrants are the economic engine of the U.S., and, in a brief interview last December, told Miami’s NBC affiliate, “I think there’s a compelling case that, if we want to be young and dynamic again, we have to make legal immigration easier.” So if heritage matters less than track records and platforms, then what should it matter to Hispanic voters how Jeb Bush identifies himself, mistakenly or otherwise?","713","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"It matters, generally speaking, because minority groups tend to recoil when outside individuals identify with them under false pretenses or with ulterior motives. It rankles, and feels disingenuous. A few months ago, many feminists in Silicon Valley were piqued by comments made by Vivek Wadhwa about women in technology as part of a larger article on the subject in Newsweek. The entrepreneur and academic has always vocally identified himself as a champion for women working in the tech industry, but when he posited, based on his research, that those women were reluctant to speak up for themselves, he was widely criticized and roundly rejected. Jeb Bush would do well to learn from Wadhwa’s precarious positioning, and to avoid the temptation to speak on behalf of any groups that have not voluntarily elected him to do so. And he certainly should not identify as a member, his wife and children notwithstanding.","714","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"Bush has at times criticized the G.O.P. for its tough tone in past elections on immigration, and he has gone so far as to call illegal immigration in the name of a better life “an act of love.” One could say about Bush that his own misidentification, along with his desire to be embraced by the Hispanic population, is something of an act of love, made with good intentions. He knows that, deep down in his DNA, he is not Hispanic, but he still hopes, in a way that seems at least partly genuine, that Hispanic voters will think of him as their candidate.","715","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"
"In fact, Bush has a history of polling well with Latinos—in 1998, he won the governorship of Florida with sixty-one per cent of the Hispanic vote to Democratic incumbent Buddy MacKay’s thirty-eight per cent. But, as the Washington Post has pointed out, that may not necessarily translate to similar numbers in 2016; in 1998, the Hispanic electorate in Florida was largely Cuban, a bloc that tends to vote Republican, whereas a national primary would call upon much wider and more diverse groups of Latinos. In 2011, nearly two-thirds of the Latino population, which consistently leans Democratic, identified as Mexican. Still, Florida, with its twenty-nine electoral votes and twenty-two-per-cent-Latino population, would be a hefty prize for Republicans.","716","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-hispanic-is-jeb-bush"

"The conventional wisdom is that Cruz hasn’t got a chance, and, as far as the Presidency goes, it’s probably accurate. To many Americans, he is the loudmouth who, in the fall of 2013, less than a year into his first term as a senator, helped bring the federal government to a halt. Noted for railing against President Obama and denying the existence of climate change, he holds views that, according to an analysis by the Web site FiveThirtyEight, make him “more conservative than every recent G.O.P. nominee, every ’12 contender and every plausible ’16 candidate.”","719","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"But if Cruz’s ultra-conservatism rules him out as a serious Presidential contender, it won’t necessarily work to his disadvantage in the Republican primaries, where his first goal is to distinguish himself from other right-wingers who are leading him in the polls, such as Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, and Ben Carson. As Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich demonstrated in 2012, the conservative G.O.P. electorate is a fluid one, which falls for articulate rogues who can package age-old nostrums and prejudices in rhetoric that vaguely resembles a coherent political philosophy. Although Cruz is off to a slow start, this weakness should play to his rhetorical skills, which are superior to those of the rest of the G.O.P. field.","720","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"At Princeton, Cruz was a national debating champion (and was, according to a roommate, known to carry a book entitled, “Was Karl Marx A Satanist?”). At Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1995, he was also known as a formidable public speaker. “He had brilliant insights and he was clearly among the top students, as revealed by his class responses,” the Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz told the Daily Caller last year.","721","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"About ten hours after sending out his tweet, Cruz took the stage at Liberty University, which Jerry Falwell founded, in 1971, in Lynchburg, Virginia, and which is now the world’s biggest college for evangelical Christians. The weekly convocation at Liberty has long served as a platform for conservative Republicans, and it’s less than two hundred miles from Washington, D.C., which means that it is within easy access for the media hordes. All in all, it’s an ideal location for a conservative candidate in need of a lift.","722","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"Cruz, clad in a conservative dark suit (what else?) and accompanied by his wife, Heidi, and their two young daughters, rose to the occasion. Prowling the stage, he talked for almost half an hour without notes, casting himself as the leader of a “grassroots army” of liberty-loving Christians who would pull America back from the jaws of secular damnation. Although most of the students in the crowd were obliged to attend, Cruz appeared to engage many of them, and he avoided making any slip-ups. As a piece of political theater, it was highly effective.","723","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"He started out by talking about his background as the son of a Cuban immigrant who fought to bring down the dictator Fulgencio Batista during the Cuban revolution, but who subsequently turned against Fidel Castro and, at the age of eighteen, decided to move to the United States. “Imagine, for a second, the hope that was in his heart as he rode that ferry boat across to Key West and got onboard a Greyhound bus to head to Austin, Texas, to begin working, washing dishes, making fifty cents an hour,” Cruz said. But the thoughts of an immigrant fifty-odd years ago weren’t the only thing that he wanted the crowd to imagine. Indeed, as the speech developed, it sounded increasingly like he was channelling John Lennon. But not Lennon the atheist skeptic and peacenik: this was a Liberty University version of the Beatle.","724","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"

"If there were any liberal Democrats tuning in, they were probably hurling things at the screen by now. Cruz wasn’t done. “Imagine repealing every word of Common Core,” he went on. “Imagine a President who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel.” (That one earned him his biggest cheer yet.) “Imagine a President who says, ‘I will honor the Constitution.’ … Imagine a President who says, ‘We will stand up and defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will call it by its name.’ ”","726","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"Appearing to be thoroughly enjoying himself, Cruz conceded that some of his wish list might be difficult, or even impossible, to imagine. He reminded his audience that, in 1979, when Ronald Reagan started his second Presidential campaign, it would have been equally impossible to imagine the Berlin Wall coming down and the Soviet Union collapsing. “Compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the I.R.S. ain’t all that tough,” Cruz said. Then he asked the audience members, most of whom weren’t born when Reagan left office, to text the words “Constitution” or “imagine” to the number 33733.","727","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"
"What did that mean? Most likely that Cruz intends to run as the Howard Dean of the religious right—a tub-thumping insurgent who uses social media to outmaneuver better-financed rivals. Speaking on Fox News, Joe Trippi, the Democratic strategist who ran Dean’s campaign in 2004, said after the speech, “I thought he did a great job.” Ed Rollins, the veteran Republican operative who was once Ronald Reagan’s campaign manager, was equally impressed. He raised the prospect of Cruz winning the Texas primary, which will take place next March, and emerging as a serious contender.","728","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/can-you-imagine-ted-cruz-as-president"

On Tuesday, he launched jebemails.com, which hosts the first chapter of a new e-book featuring e-mail exchanges from his eight years as the governor of Florida. “Some are funny; some are serious; some I wrote in frustration,” Bush writes on the home page. “But they’re all here so you can read them and make up your own mind.”","February 10, 2015","731","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"

"Actually—just as you’d expect from a nascent campaign that is already showing considerable discipline—the e-mails appear to have been carefully selected to make Bush appear to have been attuned to the concerns of ordinary Florida voters. Nonetheless, the e-mails do highlight something important about Bush and how his Presidential campaign is likely to unfold. In the early stages of a contest set to feature Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, to name but two G.O.P. rabble-rousers, Bush has often been portrayed as moderate—someone willing to confront party ultras on issues like immigration and same-sex marriage. But that’s not necessarily how Bush sees himself, and, as his e-mails confirm, it’s not what he projected when he entered the Florida governor’s mansion in 1999. Then, as now, he viewed himself as an energetic conservative reformer, with the emphasis on conservative.","733","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"After being narrowly defeated in the 1994 gubernatorial election, Bush ran again in 1998, pledging to reduce the state’s tax burden, which was already low compared with that in some parts of the country, and to downsize the state’s payroll, which he described as a chronic drag on economic growth. “One of our goals should be to have fewer government employees each year we are serving,” he wrote in an e-mail to his staff, dated December 19, 1998. “Labor has huge potential to be reduced, possibly in half.” This animus toward public employees stayed with him. “I look forward to the time when these buildings of government are empty … silent monuments to the time when government played a larger role than it deserved or could adequately fill,” he said in his second inaugural address, delivered in January, 2003.","734","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Indeed, Bush’s anti-government, pro-business instincts informed virtually all of his time as governor. He promised to get rid of regulations that restricted new developments. He said he’d take on the teachers’ unions by introducing choice and increasing the use of standardized testing in public schools. And he set out to reform the state-run Medicaid program. During his two terms in office, he followed through in all of these areas.","735","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"Bush also pushed through the biggest tax cuts in Florida’s history, vetoed spending increases that had been approved by the state legislature, and reduced the number of public-sector employees by about seven per cent. He required all schoolchildren to be tested regularly, initiated the performance-grading of their schools, and introduced a voucher system for charter schools, which the state’s Supreme Court struck down, in 2006. On the health-care front, he introduced a pilot program that allowed Medicaid recipients to select from a range of commercial health-care plans. Democrats, and some medical providers, accused him of following an ideologically driven agenda of privatization and cost-cutting that would end up harming patients. Conservatives hailed his reforms as a model for the rest of the country.","736","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"In short, Governor Jeb Bush wasn’t some sort of wishy-washy moderate. In a state traditionally dominated by a powerful legislature, he was, in the words of the University of North Florida political scientist Matthew Corrigan, “the first governor in Florida history to combine a strongly conservative agenda with an activist approach to government.” Last year, Corrigan published a book about Bush’s governorship, “Conservative Hurricane: How Jeb Bush Remade Florida.” It followed that of another academic, Robert Crew, of Florida State University, who published “Jeb Bush: Aggressive Conservatism in Florida,” in 2009. The two authors differ in their conclusions—Corrigan writes that Bush’s reforms were “long lasting and important,” while Crew is more skeptical—but they agree that, far from adopting the centrist template used by Mitt Romney and other moderate G.O.P. governors, Bush was a conservative whirlwind.","737","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"If he were elected President, there is no reason to doubt that he would pursue an equally activist and conservative agenda.

Bush.","738","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"The unresolved question is which policy areas a third President Bush would emphasize. Because of widespread opposition to the mathematics and English-language-arts standards known as the Common Core, which Bush strongly supports, education reform would present a problem for him. Immigration reform, another of Bush’s pet issues, is equally problematic. As for the old standby of pledging to cut taxes, which he did successfully in Florida, the Republican Party has been struggling for years to demonstrate that such cuts can be reconciled with balancing the budget. And the proposition that all deficits are bad isn’t one that any of the G.O.P. candidates in 2016 is likely to question.","739","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"
"In this environment, Bush’s task is to carve out an economic message that resonates with a wide swath of voters and also has some credibility. In Detroit, he spoke in generalities, earning poor reviews in some quarters, even as he was praised in others for being cagey. Still, the language he used was instructive. Accepting the terms of public debate set down by decades of wage stagnation, he identified an “opportunity gap” and said, “Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin.

As a way of boosting incomes and encouraging individual effort simultaneously, other ambitious Republicans, such as Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan, have proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit, which is effectively a federal wage subsidy for low-paid workers. If Bush knows about this proposal (and he surely does), he didn’t mention it. Indeed, conspicuously lacking from his presentation was any acknowledgement that a reformed tax and benefits system could help to tackle the economic problems he identified. Rather than engaging with a topic that is keenly discussed among self-identified “reform conservatives,” he fell back on G.O.P. boilerplate: bashing the government and raising the spectre of mass welfare dependency.","741","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"

If the government can’t collect parking fines or sell snacks on a train, why would government know how to enable every citizen to move up in life?” The answer, of course, was that supporters of government activism wouldn’t know how to help. “Instead of a safety net to cushion our occasional falls, they have built a spider web that traps people in perpetual dependence,” Bush continued.","742","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/type-conservative-jeb-bush"

Whatever Paul’s liabilities might be in the battle for his party’s nomination, his lack of experience does not appear to be one of them. He is, after all, hardly alone; the field is full of neophytes. Other than Jeb Bush, not one of the serious Republican contenders played a meaningful role in our national life before 2010, the year that Paul and Marco Rubio—who will announce his own candidacy next week in Miami—ran for the Senate. Scott Walker was elected governor of Wisconsin that same year. Ted Cruz has been in the Senate only since 2013—though it seems longer, because he hasn’t stopped talking since he got there.","747","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"

"Sifting through these candidates’ speeches, one finds few indications of past experience—little use, even, of the past tense. To the extent that they have anything to say about their own lives, it concerns, in most cases, their childhoods. They stress, in practiced fashion, their modest roots. Rubio describes himself as the “son of a bartender and a woman who worked in a hotel.” Walker tells audiences that he is the “son of a small-town preacher and a mom who was a part-time secretary.” (In the opening passage of his budget address in February, he offered even humbler detail: “Mom was raised on a farm where they didn’t have indoor plumbing.”) Cruz, meanwhile, dedicated the first six minutes of his announcement speech last month to stories about his parents’ struggles, and said more about them than he did about himself.","749","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Paul’s upbringing, by contrast, is double-edged. His father, Ron Paul, is, of course, an icon of the libertarian right, which confers, on the son, a certain kind of credibility—just not the hard-won, hardscrabble kind that candidates since Andrew Jackson have sought. At the Conservative Political Action Conference, in February, Rand Paul allowed a bit opaquely that “I was born into the America that experiences and believes in opportunity.” (If you thought he was from the America that doesn’t believe in opportunity, you were wrong.) He has had little else to say about his life, or life’s work, prior to his decision that it merits his leading the free world. The aptness of ophthalmology as a metaphor for national leadership (“I see a great nation,” as F.D.R. said) remains, at this point, unexploited.","750","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Paul is not the only Republican who appears unsure whether, or how, to talk about his work experience. Ted Cruz has spent almost all of his adult life as a litigator—in private practice and as solicitor general for the state of Texas, from 2003 to 2008. In that role, Cruz helped lead the fight to establish an individual right to bear arms and to defend the constitutionality of a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. All in all, it is a career that would make him a strong choice for attorney general in somebody else’s Administration, a little lower on the org chart than he’s aiming. Marco Rubio could make something of his career as a state legislator (and stint as House speaker) in Florida, and probably will; it’s the only experience he’s got.","751","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Scott Walker should have a stronger claim of executive experience than Rubio, Cruz, or Paul—governors, as a rule, are expected to decide things and do stuff (which is conduct unbecoming of a United States senator). And Walker does have a standard rap about what he’s accomplished in Wisconsin: mostly that he’s “put the power back in the hands of the hard-working taxpayers” (except the hands that hold union cards). Yet Walker’s attempts to inflate his credentials have only diminished them, comically so. His much-derided comment that battling public-sector unions is good training for fighting terrorists (“If I can take on a hundred thousand protestors, I can do the same across the world”) was a warmup, it turned out, for his also-derided claim that his tenure as a teen-age Eagle Scout led him to “be prepared” for the dispatch of soldiers into battle.

"Jeb Bush has plenty of experience, but admits it only under duress. In a Q. & A. session at CPAC, Sean Hannity pressed Bush to talk about his two terms as governor of Florida. “Here’s the record,” Bush answered a bit testily. “And it’s a record that may be hard for people to imagine, because it’s a record of accomplishment, of getting things done.” This is precisely the problem; some of the things Bush got done then or has supported since—immigration reform, Common Core standards—provoke fits in Republican primary voters. Bush’s reluctance to talk about his governorship—paired with his pained ambivalence about his family name—gives his candidacy a feeling of disconnectedness, an emptiness at its core. “It can’t be about the past, can’t be about my mom or dad or brother,” Bush told Hannity. What it can be about remains an open question.","753","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"The Republicans’ résumés—Bush’s excepted—are not notably thinner than Barack Obama’s was in 2008. For all his appeal as a candidate, plenty of Democrats did wonder whether a man who’d never run anything but the Harvard Law Review was actually prepared to be President. This was the thrust of Hillary Clinton’s campaign (“ready on Day One”) that year as well as John McCain’s (“I know how the world works”). Obama turned those opponents’ experience against them, rendering each one as a weary embodiment of the status quo. His inexperience underscored the entire rationale of his candidacy—its novelty, the break it represented with the past. Obama calculated, rightly, that he had little to gain by spending another term or two in the Senate.","754","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"But as Rand Paul and his peers hasten to point out, none of them is like Obama. The point of gaining experience is not to acquire credentials, or wear different, increasingly impressive hats, or learn how to do things like run a complex organization or operate heavy machinery, but to learn from it—to test ideas and abandon the dumb ones, to evolve, to improve. Some leaders, like Obama, gain that kind of insight by their mid-forties; others never do. The troubling thing about Rand Paul and the other Republican hopefuls is their indifference—indeed, their proud resistance—to the kind of experience that broadens one’s perspective and changes one’s mind. Paul “is exactly the same person he was 25 to 30 years ago,” a former aide to Paul’s father told a reporter on the eve of today’s announcement. “He hasn’t really changed.” Only at a high-school class reunion or in a Republican Presidential primary would that be meant as a compliment.","755","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"“An American in Paris,” the musical that just opened at the Palace Theatre, is very different from the 1951 Vincente Minnelli movie on which it is based. The film was a star vehicle for Gene Kelly, and it shows him in his most cock-of-the-walk mode, tap-dancing over the cobblestones of Paris (or an M-G-M set designer’s idea thereof) and smiling at us with what appears to be fifty teeth. To the film’s first audiences, still getting over the Second World War, he must have seemed like America personified, and, indeed, his character is an ex-G.I. The new musical, by contrast, is directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, who is English and was trained in classical ballet. He was a bright light of New York City Ballet in the nineteen-nineties, but he began making dances almost as soon as he started dancing, and, in 2000, he moved over to choreography full time. In the past few years, he has created an “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” and a “Winter’s Tale,” for England’s Royal Ballet and the National Ballet of Canada, but he has worked for just about every major ballet company in the world, and is one of the busiest and most admired figures in the field. Perhaps this literary-minded, ballet-trained Briton was not a natural choice to direct a quintessentially American show, with an American story and, above all, an American score, featuring George Gershwin’s famous 1928 tone poem, together with his wonderful, jazzy songs. Also, he had never directed a musical. He hesitated, but let himself be persuaded.","756","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/love-and-war-dance-joan-acocella"
"The book, by Craig Lucas, gives us basically the same plot as the movie. Jerry Mulligan is a painter who fought in France during the war and fell so much in love with Paris that he couldn’t bear to leave when the conflict was over. So here he is, in 1951, or thereabouts, peddling his paintings on the streets of Montmartre and being pursued by an American heiress, who would like to finance his work in exchange for a little companionship. Then he meets a French girl, Lise, and instantly loses his heart. But she is mysteriously bound to another man. This all works itself out, as such musical-comedy tangles do.","757","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/love-and-war-dance-joan-acocella"
"Yet Wheeldon, coming from ballet, rather than from tap—and from England, which kept fighting after France surrendered—gives us a more noir picture. The show opens not in 1951 but in 1945, just after the end of the war. No confetti is being thrown. Paris is dark and poor. There are beggars and hoodlums in the street, and soldiers coming home to wives who look at them funny, as if to say, “Oh, no, what am I going to tell my lover?” The Eiffel Tower and the Invalides loom in the background, like a memory. Into all this stumbles Jerry—a role for which Wheeldon chose Robert Fairchild, New York City Ballet’s foremost male dancer. “C’mon,” Jerry’s buddy says. “We’re going home.” But Jerry rips up his train ticket. Paris may look grim to us, but not to him. He’s staying.","758","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/love-and-war-dance-joan-acocella"
"Wheeldon doesn’t just show us the damage done by the war. He is a man of 2015, not 1951, and he lays out the political issues. In his war, there were Jews—for example, a pianist named Adam Hochberg, played by Brandon Uranowitz. Jerry encounters Adam when he stops in at a café and asks if there are rooms to let upstairs. Sure, Adam says, and if Jerry is a Jew, like him, the landlord won’t even charge him rent. That’s how guilty the Parisians feel. This character was in the Minnelli movie, played by the excellent Oscar Levant, but he didn’t say anything about Jews, and his last name was Cook. As Wheeldon told Roslyn Sulcas, of the Times, about casting Uranowitz, “We needed someone who understood the more acerbic, temperamental side of being a young Jewish-American composer, who reflected Gershwin.”","759","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/love-and-war-dance-joan-acocella"
"But forget acerbic Jewish Americans. This show has homosexuals. In the movie, there’s a music-hall star—Henri Baurel, a friend of Adam’s—who raves about a girl he loves but hasn’t got around to marrying. In Wheeldon’s show, Henri, played by Max von Essen, sings not in a music hall but in a Montmartre boîte, and even his mother asks him whether his romantic interests extend beyond the fair sex. Wheeldon wants us to know that there are troubles in the world, and things that have to be hidden. To underline the note of vulnerability, he makes his stars look very young. Robert Fairchild is twenty-seven, but the design people have made him seem about eighteen. His hair has a bump in the front, like Archie’s, in the comics, and his pants sit dorkily high on his waist. As for his leading lady, Leanne Cope, a corps dancer at the Royal Ballet, she looks like jailbait, as did Gene Kelly’s Lise, Leslie Caron, to whom she bears a striking resemblance.","760","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/love-and-war-dance-joan-acocella"
"As well as adding sorrow to the story, Wheeldon has given it clarity. It isn’t just by Jerry that Lise is being wooed; she’s also the one that Henri thinks he’s going to marry, and Adam is in love with her, too. So there’s an almost architectonic triangulation, and Wheeldon stresses this in his blocking. We feel the threads of emotion being pulled among these three friends, one of whom is going to beat out the other two. When there’s a mismatched couple talking on one side of the stage, there’s a symmetrically mismatched couple on the other side. It’s like “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Nobody is getting what he or she wants.","761","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/love-and-war-dance-joan-acocella"
"With such a firm grasp on the structure, Wheeldon can afford to be a little weird and woozy when he wants. Scenes melt into and out of one another. The masterly set designer, Bob Crowley, using flats and projections, puts a soft edge on Paris, as if we were seeing the city reflected in the Seine. The songs, adapted and arranged by Rob Fisher, the founder and former director of City Center’s Encores! series—the show’s songbook ranges far afield from the movie’s—often make a sidelong sense, floating in and out, trailing off.","762","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/love-and-war-dance-joan-acocella"
"Wheeldon, like Kelly, clearly intended his production to be primarily a dance show. Otherwise, he would not have cast a professional dancer as his Lise. (Kelly did the same: Caron was performing with Roland Petit’s Ballets des Champs-Élysées when he spotted her.) But lots of Wheeldon’s dance smarts go into casual things: street scenes, crowd scenes. There are only a few big, flat-out numbers in the show. In “I’ll Build a Stairway to Paradise,” Henri, with a battalion of sequinned chorines and tuxedoed gents—this is in his imagination—does a spectacular up-and-down-the-stairs routine at Radio City Music Hall. As in the movie, much energy is devoted to the “American in Paris” dream ballet, and, as in the movie, the result is an arty bore. (It is nobly feminist, though. In the movie version, the ballet is Jerry’s dream of Lise. Here it’s Lise’s dream of Jerry.) My favorite dance is a delicious parody of French postwar avant-garde ballet—a Serge Lifar sort of business, with flexed feet and gold lamé spaceman costumes—that is performed at a swanky party that Jerry attends. It’s called “The Eclipse of Uranus.”","763","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/love-and-war-dance-joan-acocella"
"The glory of the Kelly version is his tap dancing. In Wheeldon’s show, there is no tap number except “Stairway to Paradise.” He has spoken in his own language, and Fairchild’s: ballet. The steps he has created for Fairchild show us the qualities that have made this man so beautiful and rare a star: his speed, his concentration, his touching gravity, his lack of affectation. It’s as if he had never heard of vulgarity. But I am not sure that these particular virtues serve him well in a Broadway musical, and the same is true for many of the other actors. The only one who has the temerity to walk downstage and demand our attention and tell us what to think is Brandon Uranowitz. (Also, he and von Essen are the only ones who can really sing, although Cope doesn’t do badly.) On the whole, Wheeldon’s “American in Paris” is tasteful, witty, sophisticated, decent-hearted—even lovely, often—and a little mild, a little pale. It is not so much something as a meditation on something, and that’s what it feels like, much of the time. ♦","764","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/love-and-war-dance-joan-acocella"
"One evening earlier this month, in a small fifth-floor tenement just off Istanbul’s iconic Istiklal Caddesi, I attended a private screening of “The Cow Farm,” a new documentary by the Syrian filmmaker Ali Sheikh Khudr. Twenty-eight years old and slight, with a wispy ponytail streaked prematurely with grey, Khudr sat cross-legged on the far side of the living room beneath a bed sheet that had been tacked to the wall to make a screen. While the opening credits flickered from a projector on the opposite end of the room, I noticed Khudr taking furtive looks at the crowd pressed shoulder-to-shoulder behind him, a mix of expat artists and writers, as well as Syrian democratic activists working in exile from Istanbul. These weren’t the usual pre-show jitters: Khudr had himself been one of these activists, attending demonstrations in Damascus in 2011, and “The Cow Farm” is a sympathetic portrayal of a soldier fighting for the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. What’s more, the soldier depicted was Khudr’s cousin Hassan, who was killed in the summer of 2013.","April 18, 2015","765","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/searching-for-a-true-story-of-the-syrian-civil-war"

"In the past two years, a handful of films chronicling Syria’s civil war have been released. The protagonists in these works, which have encompassed the mass protests that marked the war’s revolutionary beginnings and the savage and elliptical fighting that characterizes it today, have mainly been demonstrators and freedom fighters, their stories playing out on a grand political stage and framed in ideological terms that would be sympathetic to Western and anti-Assad audiences. The most notable of these films is Talal Derki’s documentary “Return to Homs,” which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. The film depicts two years in the life of Abdul Baset al-Sarout, a former goalkeeper for Syria’s national football team who became an iconic rebel fighter. It opens with Sarout hoisted upon the shoulders of a crowd in Homs, leading protest songs before the gathered thousands. “The army’s hearts are dead / The honor in them is dead / The age of oppression will end / The people shall overcome.” He and his fellow-demonstrators renounce nonviolent protest and take up arms against Assad’s regime. Sarout is twice wounded—once while on camera—as he leads his men in an attempt to liberate Homs.","767","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/searching-for-a-true-story-of-the-syrian-civil-war"
"Khudr’s ambition with “The Cow Farm” was far different. As I watched the film projected onto the bed-sheet screen, I could see that it would be unlikely to garner much in the way of international accolades or grand-jury trophies. Filmed mainly in 2012 and self-financed by Khudr, the documentary has a homemade feel, with long meandering shots interspersed by off-kilter camera angles. It has no epic scenes in which its protagonist speaks grandly of the travails of the people battling regimes, or leads men in daring breakouts through a beleaguered city. Much of the film involves Hassan, a cow farmer, attending to chores on his farm outside the city of Hama—milking his cows, cleaning their quarters—or drinking beer in a one-room hovel, lit by a single bulb, at the end of a day. The son of divorced parents, Hassan speaks of the peace he feels on his farm, of how the emotions of animals are more enduring than those of people. When pressed on the topics of politics and Assad—on whether it would be better to back the revolution, despite the chaos it has unleashed—he says only, “What forces us to accept the bad is the worse.” If certain wars become the tyranny of an ideological minority over those who wish to go about their lives unmolested, Khudr is telling the story of a member of this majority. Hassan wishes nothing more than quiet seclusion.","768","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/searching-for-a-true-story-of-the-syrian-civil-war"
"The promotional materials, too, present a contrast between “The Cow Farm” and “Return to Homs.” The poster for the latter is a Photoshopped closeup of Sarout, his mouth slightly open as if speaking, his eyes set skyward, reminiscent of Alberto Korda’s famous photograph of Che Guevara. The poster for “The Cow Farm” shows Hassan with his back turned as he urinates in his fields while a helicopter passes overhead.","769","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/searching-for-a-true-story-of-the-syrian-civil-war"
"After “The Cow Farm” finished, the lights came up and Khudr spoke to a silent crowd. “My goal was to give a face to the tens of thousands of Syrians who have been killed in this war and forgotten. Out of that number, I wanted to tell one true story.” A Syrian woman in the back stood and thanked him for making the film. Then a modest reception of cookies and fruit juice began in the screening room. I stepped out onto the fire escape, where I bummed a cigarette and took in the Istanbul skyline, a picket of minarets mingling with the neon glow of rooftop discos. I thought about what Khudr had just said, and wondered: If Hassan’s is a true story, then what would a false one look like?","770","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/searching-for-a-true-story-of-the-syrian-civil-war"
"In the final scene of “Return to Homs,” Sarout, partially crippled after being shot through the leg, and knowing he will never play football again, departs on yet another desperate mission to liberate an embattled section of Homs. As he heads off into the night in the back of a truck, surrounded by his men, he once again leads them in song: “I’ll march ahead with a heart of iron / My stubborn heart has made its decision / My destination is the land of lions.” It was a rousing conclusion to a powerful film. Yet as “Return To Homs” was being awarded at Sundance, Sarout, its protagonist, was making public statements in the Arabic press. His goal in the revolution, he said, now aligned with that of militant groups, such as Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS, who sought to create an Islamic state in Syria.","771","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/searching-for-a-true-story-of-the-syrian-civil-war"
"The conclusion of “The Cow Farm” strikes a different note. After being conscripted into the Syrian army, Hassan makes a final visit to his mother’s home in Salamiyah, a village outside of Hama. They argue bitterly after Hassan, despite his imminent departure, refuses to sell his cows. That night, after returning to his farm, he laments how the world has encroached on his oasis. “Everyone wants to interfere and give an opinion,” he says. Then, off camera, a bomb explodes. Staring into the blackness, and speaking to no one in particular, Hassan says, “Fuck you.” The few scenes that follow serve as an epilogue, describing Hassan’s death a few months later fighting Syrian rebels in Salamiyah.","772","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/searching-for-a-true-story-of-the-syrian-civil-war"
"As the reception began to empty, I saw Khudr standing alone, sipping orange juice and checking his phone. I entered from the fire escape and we struck up a conversation. After some small talk, I asked him what had happened to Hassan’s cows. “They’re still there,” he said.","773","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/searching-for-a-true-story-of-the-syrian-civil-war"
"Just before it became the first man-made vessel to leave the solar system, in 1990, Voyager 1 took a portrait of Earth, some four billion miles away. Our pinprick of a planet occupied a mere twelve per cent of one pixel, but its atmosphere, rich in water, oxygen, and ozone, reflected and scattered the glow of the sun in an unmistakable way; the astronomer Carl Sagan dubbed Earth the “pale blue dot.” Now, a quarter of a century later, a new generation of telescopes promises to let astronomers capture similarly small portraits of Earth-sized planets beyond our solar system—dots that may well be electric green or neon pink. And, just as Voyager’s image of Earth provided a pale-blue clue to our planet’s atmospheric chemistry, the colors of alien worlds will contain valuable information about their ability to support life. As Lynn Rothschild, an evolutionary biologist at NASA’s Ames Research Center, put it, “You have to milk that one lousy pixel for everything it has got.”","April 3, 2015","774","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/exoplanet-biosignature-color-alien-life"
"Last month, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Rothschild and her colleagues Siddharth Hegde, Lisa Kaltenegger, Ryan Kent, and Ivan G. Paulino-Limab announced the creation of an open-access database that aims to help astronomers do just that. It is a library of so-called biosignatures, the colors that living creatures—in this case, a hundred and thirty-seven species of microbe—reflect back when illuminated. The spectra range from the egg-yolk yellow of Halorubrum chaoviator, a single-celled organism that was isolated from Pacific sea salt, to the deep blue-green of Dermocarpa violacea, a cyanobacterium that was collected from an aquarium outflow in La Jolla, California. Viewed side by side in their petri dishes, the library’s sample colonies look like a set of punk eye shadows. “Among microbes, I think we’ve done a pretty darn good job of getting a snapshot of what colors exist on Earth,” Rothschild said.","775","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/exoplanet-biosignature-color-alien-life"
"Until recently, astronomers had focussed on analyzing a planet’s reflected light for evidence that its atmosphere contained oxygen or other gases that are considered to be positive indicators for the presence of life. In 2002, however, they proved for the first time that a pigment—chlorophyll, the molecule that makes plants and certain algae appear green to our eyes—could serve as a biosignature. By observing Earthshine, the sunlight that is reflected from Earth onto the surface of the moon, they were able to detect a “vegetation red edge,” a distinctive spike in the near-infrared region that is caused by chlorophyll. (To an alien equipped with infrared goggles, the faint glowing pixel that is Earth would actually have a hot-pink tinge.) But the chances of finding a chlorophyll-rich Earth analogue are slim. Indeed, if you had been an alien gazing at our planet relatively recently—four hundred and sixty million years ago, which is the equivalent of last Saturday on the cosmic calendar—land plants would not yet have been widespread, which would have meant no signature red edge. “Earth is the only example of life we have, and so we have to start from it,” Rothschild said. “But we have to be clever about it.” In other words, we have to go beyond chlorophyll to assemble a more expansive catalogue of life’s possible colors.","776","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/exoplanet-biosignature-color-alien-life"
"For Rothschild’s co-author Lisa Kaltenegger, the director of Cornell University’s newly formed Institute for Pale Blue Dots, this realization came during a NASA conference at Yellowstone National Park, where she noticed that colonies of geyser-dwelling microbes come in a rainbow of reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and browns. Rothschild has spent much of her career collecting and studying these sorts of extremophiles—organisms whose preferred habitats are too salty, too hot, too cold, too dry, or too dark for the rest of us. Although they are not the most visible form of life on Earth today, it is not hard to imagine them dominating other, hotter, colder, drier, darker, or saltier worlds. According to Rothschild and Kaltenegger, as we examine reflected light from around the galaxy, we’re at least as likely to spot an extremophile’s biosignature as an oak tree’s.","777","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/exoplanet-biosignature-color-alien-life"
"The database has its limitations. For starters, a planet orbiting a hot blue-white star will not have the same reflectance characteristics as a planet orbiting a cooler red dwarf. Moreover, certain surface features—mineral deposits, gases, ices—can distort the light, obscuring biosignatures or producing false positives. In the nineteen-fifties, the Harvard astronomer William Sinton made reflectance measurements of Mars that appeared to indicate the presence of lichen-type organisms. A decade later, the pattern that he observed was revealed to have been caused by molecules of heavy water in Earth’s own atmosphere. As Kaltenegger noted, matching the colors of life can only ever serve as a guide to, rather than a confirmation of, life’s presence. “We can say, ‘This planet looks pinkish,’ and then we can say, ‘Well, on Earth that would be this kind of algae,’ ” she said. “What we can’t say is that there is no other explanation for pinkishness.”","778","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/exoplanet-biosignature-color-alien-life"
"Being able to consult a library of biosignatures, however, will undoubtedly prove helpful. At the time that NASA launched Kepler, its planet-hunting spacecraft, in early 2009, astronomers had identified only about three hundred planets beyond our solar system. Most were gas giants, like Jupiter, and none looked particularly hospitable to life. But Kepler has identified more than a thousand smaller, more Earth-like planets within its narrow band of observation. Last month, researchers at Denmark’s Niels Bohr Institute, extrapolating from Kepler’s findings, suggested that there may be many billions of watery and rocky (and therefore potentially life-supporting) planets in the Milky Way alone. Though we won’t be paying these alien Earths a visit anytime soon, we can begin the process of sorting through them and selecting the best candidates now.","779","http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/exoplanet-biosignature-color-alien-life"
"The developers of the database see ways of expanding its usefulness. Kaltenegger is at work on a paper discussing how much of a planet’s surface an organism has to cover in order to be detectable. Rothschild has been collaborating with a team of undergraduates from Stanford and Brown to engineer an artificial extremophile called Hell Cell; the project, or one like it, may free future astronomers from their terracentricity by giving them access to the biosignatures of speculative, synthetic life-forms. In the meantime, Rothschild expects her colleagues at NASA to find applications for the database here on Earth. The agency already uses satellite measurements of chlorophyll to detect whether crops are healthy or stressed; this new spectral catalogue could help track ebbs and flows in Earth’s microbiome, too.

"On Friday, the Supreme Court agreed to review cases from four different states, all in the Sixth Circuit, that, in different ways, pose the question of whether same-sex couples have a Constitutional right to marry—an issue the Supreme Court had not yet directly ruled on. The cases are known by the names of the lead plaintiffs: Bourke v. Beshear, in Kentucky; DeBoer v. Snyder, in Michigan; Obergefell v. Hodges, in Ohio; Tanco v. Haslam, in Tennessee. Each plaintiff’s name is followed by an “et al.,” representing dozens of more names, and families. And then there is a plaintiff who is listed somewhat differently: Adopted Child Doe.","January 16, 2015","781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-equality-childrens-crusade"

"Adopted Child Doe is twenty months old; his real name is Cooper Talmas-Vitale. Cooper has ended up in the Supreme Court because the State of Ohio will not give him a birth certificate with the names of both of his parents, Joseph Vitale and Rob Talmas. The two men had adopted him from a birth mother in Ohio; they were both in the hospital the day he was born, and stayed there all night. They were married in New York, where they live with Cooper, and New York State recognizes their adoption. But Ohio has told them that they have to choose which man gets to be the legally listed father. There are three other couples in the Ohio case with children who have similarly been denied accurate birth certificates, though it appears that Cooper is the only one who is a plaintiff. The Supreme Court has instructed that the briefs on his behalf, and on that of his parents and the other adults, be filed on April 17th, which is around the time of his second birthday. By June, there may be a right to marry in all fifty states.","783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-equality-childrens-crusade"
"The Court may rule against marriage equality, of course, or it may rule more narrowly. The Justices had a chance to make a definitive statement in the summer of 2013, in Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case that challenged California’s state marriage ban but was designed as a larger constitutional test. The Justices ultimately dismissed it on technical grounds, which had the effect of bringing marriage rights to California—good, but not grand. The same day, though, the Court, in United States v. Windsor, struck down most of the Defense of Marriage Act, which had denied federal recognition to same-sex marriages sanctioned by states. That was seen as a relatively narrow ruling, too, but it didn’t turn out that way. As judges around the country read Windsor, they saw in its invocations of constitutional principles of equal protection and of due process—and of basic, civic dignity—a sort of stealth fifty-state ruling. Some forty federal judges felt that Windsor compelled them to overturn bans and permit marriages. Their rulings had the effect of bringing marriage equality to more states—now thirty-five, covering about seventy per cent of the country’s population. When the Supreme Court had the chance to review those rulings, last October, it chose instead to let them stand. The only panel that disagreed was in the Sixth Circuit, thanks to a split appellate decision. (I have written about that decision and its flawed logic.) By taking the Sixth Circuit cases now, the Supreme Court is not so much seizing the chance to make a statement on marriage and the Constitution as to clarify whether, in Windsor, it already has.","784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-equality-childrens-crusade"
"There is still a chance for a less than conclusive ruling this summer. On Friday, the Court said that it would look at two separate questions: “1) Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex?” and “2) Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?” In other words, it is possible that the Court could rule only that states have to recognize marriages in other states—that Cooper, whose parents are, in the eyes of the State of New York, married, could have both of their names on his birth certificate, even though they could not have been married in Ohio. Another case involves a widower named James Obergefell, married in Maryland, who wants his husband’s Ohio death certificate to list him as his survivor. The Michigan case is the one of the four that fully engages the first question—a right to marry, to walk down the aisle and say one’s vows in any state—and will probably be the most closely watched.","785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-equality-childrens-crusade"
"The Michigan case was brought by April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse. They are both nurses, and they each have adopted children with special needs. They want to marry, to bring their families together. Windsor involved a widow, Edith Windsor, who had been left with an unconscionable estate-tax bill when the wife she had tended through a long illness died. It is no accident that so many of these cases involve children and spouses who have died or are very ill. (Obergefell’s husband died while the case was being litigated.) It is in moments of connection and vulnerability that the many protections of marriage, its legally clarifying quality, are most crucial. As the trial judge in Cooper’s case wrote, “The children in Plaintiffs’ and other same-sex married couples’ families cannot be denied the right to two legal parents, reflected on their birth certificates and given legal respect, without a sufficient justification. No such justification exists.”","786","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-equality-childrens-crusade"
"Children, as they figure out who they are in the world, care about things like dignity. In Windsor, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the Defense of Marriage Act “humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples. The law in question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.” That was true, and it is true of the state bans on marriage, too. If, this June, the Supreme Court decides in favor of Bourke, DeBoer, Obergefell, and Tanco—and Adopted Child Doe—the Justices will have affirmed an essential promise in the Constitution, and moved further in this country’s fitful, historic journey toward fulfilling full civil rights. And it will be a victory for a lot of American children, too.","787","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/marriage-equality-childrens-crusade"
"Hillary Clinton’s official announcement that she is running for President comes almost ten months to the day that she set out on a book tour to promote “Hard Choices,” a memoir of her four years as Secretary of State. Much has happened since that day, when supporters lined up for hours to get into the Barnes and Noble in Manhattan’s Union Square, where Clinton was signing copies, and some of it will work to her advantage.","April 11, 2015","788","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"With Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to jump into the Democratic primary, Clinton still lacks effective competition, whereas early indications that the Republican contest would turn into a slugfest have been confirmed, with at least half a dozen serious candidates entering, or preparing to enter, the race. In the past year or so, the U.S. economic situation has improved—job growth has picked up (with the exception of last month), and the number of people without health insurance has continued to fall as the effects of the Affordable Care Act have taken hold. Assuming Clinton wins the nomination, both of these things will make it easier for her to defend President Obama’s legacy, and to point to the potential folly, with things improving, of the economy coming under the tutelage of extremist Republicans.","789","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"

"Doubtless, the Republican candidates will subject Clinton to virulent attacks on all manner of subjects, but that could well help her to unite the Democratic Party behind her, and to rally the activists whose support she will need to get out the vote in places such as Florida and Ohio. Moreover, the electoral map remains favorable to the Democrats. If Clinton can carry all of the eighteen states, plus the District of Columbia, that have gone blue in every election since her husband’s first victory, in 1992, she will have two hundred and forty-two electoral votes, leaving her within striking distance of victory. As always, the contest is likely to come down a few battleground states, including Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. If Clinton can hold together the “Obama coalition” of young voters, women, and minorities, she has a very good chance of winning. (On the online-betting sites, she is the firm favorite.)","791","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"While the external circumstances favor Clinton, the preparations for her campaign have been anything but smooth. Her book tour was marred by a series of mini-gaffes—or that’s what the media perceived them to be, anyway. Earlier this year, it emerged that the Clintons’ charitable foundation, which was recently renamed the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, had taken donations from foreign governments, including repressive ones such as the monarchies that rule Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Then came the news that, during her time at the State Department, Clinton set up and operated a private e-mail system, whose server was subsequently wiped clean at her request. Clinton insisted that she had preserved all of the work-related e-mails on her server, about thirty thousand of them, and forwarded copies of them to Congress, but Republicans on Capitol Hill (and on the campaign trail) are unlikely to let the matter drop.","792","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"To be sure, many Democratic strategists insist that the furor over the Clinton Foundation donations and the e-mails are inside-the-Beltway affairs that won’t have any lasting impact on her campaign. But recent opinion polls tell a somewhat different story. In a Gallup poll carried out in early June, 2014, Clinton’s approval rating was fifty-four per cent, and her disapproval rating was forty-three per cent. Now, according to the Huffington Post’s poll-of-polls, her approval rating is forty-eight per cent and her disapproval rating is 46.2 per cent. And two recent polls, from Public Policy Polling and from Fox, show Clinton’s unfavorability rating moving above fifty per cent.","793","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"In the aftermath of the e-mails story, the Republicans also appeared to be eating into Clinton’s putative lead over various G.O.P. candidates in a number of battleground states—gaps that, until recently, had been holding steady. A poll from Quinnipiac University, released a few days ago, showed Clinton tied (statistically speaking) in Colorado and in Iowa with seven Republicans: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, and Ted Cruz. (In Colorado, Walker, Paul, and Rubio were actually leading Clinton, but all of their leads were within the poll’s margin of error.) In Virginia, Clinton still seems to be holding her ground. According to the poll, she leads the Republicans by margins that vary from four points to ten points. But over all, the survey’s message was a worrying one for her campaign: “It is difficult to see Secretary Clinton’s slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail,” the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, Peter A. Brown, said.","794","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Of course, it is very early, and the polling data shouldn’t be taken too seriously. In the old days—I’m talking twenty or thirty years ago—a disapproval rating of more than forty per cent was considered a serious handicap to any candidate, but things have changed. In the current, highly polarized environment, Republicans rarely say they approve of Democrats, or vice versa. At the start of 2012, President Obama’s disapproval rating sat at about fifty per cent, according to Gallup, yet, he handily won reëlection. The key to victory isn’t being popular. It’s being less unpopular than the other candidate and getting your supporters to turn out.","795","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"With a formidable Democratic campaign apparatus to call on and a bruising Republican primary ahead, Clinton shouldn’t have much trouble raising the alarm about the prospect of the G.O.P. controlling the White House, as well as Congress. But, of course, it will be a tough race. The Republicans are coming off a strong performance in the midterms, and the Democrats have occupied the White House for eight years. As Al Gore discovered, in 2000, winning a third Presidential term for your party isn’t easy, even if you win the popular vote.","796","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Clinton’s first task is to switch the focus away from the e-mails story, which has clearly had an adverse effect on her reputation. Until now, her strategy has been to try to tough it out and move on. But she must be aware that the explanation she provided for setting up her own e-mail operation—it was all a matter of convenience—was a flimsy one, and that it didn’t persuade a lot of people. Referring to the Quinnipiac poll in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia, Brown said,“In all three of these states, more, and in Colorado many more, registered voters say she is not honest and trustworthy. Voters do think she is a strong leader—a key metric—but unless she can change the honesty perception, running as a competent but dishonest candidate has serious potential problems.”","797","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Having offered up her version of the e-mails story, Clinton could hardly change tack, but she had to do something to arrest the decline in her numbers. Hence, surely, the decision to launch her campaign now, and then, reportedly, to travel to Iowa in the coming days and, later this month, to New Hampshire. That was clearly the right thing to do. Now Clinton needs to demonstrate that, at the age of sixty-seven, after more than twenty years in the public spotlight, she represents a brighter future rather than a fractious past.","798","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"An important part of her message, and one that the all-male Republican field may well have trouble countering, is that it’s high time for America to elect a female President. But if Clinton is to follow the examples of Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel, and Dilma Rousseff, she will also have to project a powerful message about where she wants to lead the country. In policy terms, all indications are that she will run a traditional Democratic campaign, promoting social mobility and emphasizing the interests of the middle class. That’s what Bill Clinton did in 1992; it’s what she did in 2008; and it’s what Obama did in 2012. Given the enduring problems of wage stagnation and rising inequality, it is the appropriate and right agenda.","799","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"The task is to make it sound fresh and convincing. I well recall Michael Dukakis campaigning on his version of the “middle-class agenda,” and it wasn’t enough to carry him to victory over George H. W. Bush. But things have changed since 1988, when the full scale of the economic challenge facing ordinary Americans was only beginning to be understood. Today there is hardly a policy-oriented economist in the country who isn’t concerned, in some way, about issues relating to wage stagnation and inequality. To tackle these problems and to promote what is often referred to as “inclusive prosperity,” Clinton can call on a wide range of experts, and a number of detailed proposals that Democratic think tanks, such as the centrist Center for American Progress and the liberal Economic Policy Institute have laid out in recent reports. The ideas range from raising the minimum wage and encouraging the growth of trade unions, to changing the tax code and investing in infrastructure.","800","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Policy wonks, myself included, will be watching closely to see what proposals Clinton adopts and which experts she chooses to rely on. (So far, she’s covering all her bases. A few weeks ago, she spoke at a Center for American Progress event. Last week, she attended a meeting organized by the progressive Roosevelt Institute.) But from the broader perspective of her campaign, the imperative is that she taps into the deep economic insecurity that many Americans feel, and that she is seen to have a credible and sensible agenda for tackling it. And on top of that, of course, she will need to craft a foreign-policy message that addresses Americans’ concerns about the chaos they see enveloping many parts of the world, but that hopefully also goes beyond the hawkish stance that she sometimes adopted in the Senate.","801","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"

"Ryan Hall, at thirty-two years old, is best known for running a marathon faster than anyone else born in America ever has: he finished the 2011 Boston Marathon in two hours, four minutes, and fifty-eight seconds. He’s since become known for failing to meet the high expectations set by that feat; the races he’s been able to run over the course of the past four years have almost all been underwhelming. He dropped out of the 2012 Olympic marathon after ten miles, and then finished twentieth in Boston in 2014. Worse, he’s often failed to reach the starting line: he withdrew from Chicago in 2010, New York in 2012, and both Boston and New York in 2013, citing injury or fitness issues. All of these failures came during what should be the prime of a distance runner’s career.","806","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"
"As Hall jogged through the streets, his wife of nine years, a bright-eyed brunette named Sara—who is also a professional élite runner—followed closely behind, as did his tattooed and bearded manager, Tony Herr, whom he’s known since high school. The pace was a relatively relaxed seven minutes per mile. Hall, who has trained mostly without a coach for the past few years, wore a watch, but ignored it. He planned to run an easy five or six miles at this “shake-out” pace until he decided it was time to stop.","807","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"
"Ten minutes into the run, Hall’s hat blew off in the wind, reaching the edge of the busy street. Turning to help, Sara tripped and fell on the grass. Hall reached into the street and snagged it, just as a car sped by. No one seemed alarmed.","808","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"
"Despite all the professional pressures, Hall seemed relaxed and ready to run his first marathon in nearly a year, just a few hours from his home town of Big Bear Lake. His running career started there, at the age of fourteen, when he decided to run the full fifteen miles around the lake with his dad. Hall completed this run, and with, he says, God’s urging (he’s a devout and outspoken Christian) kept on going, all the way to an exemplary running career at Stanford University, where he was the five-thousand-metre N.C.A.A. champion, and to a spot on the starting line at the Beijing Olympics, where he finished a disappointing tenth. (Peter Hessler wrote about Hall for the magazine before those Olympics.)","809","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"
"The latest bad news: forecasters were predicting record heat in Los Angeles on race day, approaching ninety degrees. Hall waved off the notion that this would have any significant bearing on his performance. The starting time had been moved up, to 6:55 A.M., and the temperature wouldn’t breach seventy-five before he finished the race. “It’s definitely not what I would order for the day,” he said. “I’d be like, the colder the better. But, at the same time, everyone has to run in it.”","810","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"

"“The level of joy I’m capable of experiencing now is not dependent on me winning the Olympic Games or me running 2:02 in the marathon,” Hall said. “All it’s dependent on is how connected I am with God. I’m glad that it’s not exclusive. Winning the gold medal or winning the L.A. Marathon or whatever—one guy is going to do that, and everyone else is going to be disappointed.” He went on, “I don’t like that about sports. I want everyone to experience the elation of what it’s like to win the gold medal, but obviously that’s not possible. But we can experience a joy that’s even deeper than that—like, every single person, every moment of every day. It’s possible.”","812","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"
"“Running can be such a beautiful sport,” Hall said later. “An amazing experience for everyone. But I’ve also been on the other side of that, where I’ve lived for the victories and the performances and I just—I know how shallow and fleeting and chasing-the-wind that is. So it breaks my heart when I see other people doing that same thing I’ve done, and knowing what they’re in store for.” He added, “It’s like, ‘Dude, no matter what you accomplish, it’s not gonna fill you up. It’s not what you’re looking for.’ ”","813","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"

"Hall described his goal: “To never compare myself to myself or anyone else. I think comparison is bad. It’s bad in sports, it’s bad in life, it’s bad in writing, it’s just bad. But it is called a competition, so how do you do a competition the right way? For me, that’s where it comes back to excellence.

You can only have your best day ever once. So if all you’re gonna do is compare your best day ever to every other day, you’re just gonna be disappointed for 99.9 per cent of your life.

But he could never do it. And I think that kind of hits on, like, you don’t get your best performances by trying harder. When you see the guy who wins the race, he usually jogs out of it waving to the crowd, feeling good. The people who look the worst come in after the top guy.”","817","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"
"“Great performances, when they’ve happened in my career, have come out very organically,” Hall continued. “They were fun, and I enjoyed it, and it came with great excitement. It wasn’t like I pushed harder than ever. It was just flowing, like a physical sensation.” He cited his record-setting half-marathon, in 2007, as an example: “When I ran fifty-nine minutes, I was just feeling like a million bucks. I couldn’t help but run fast. And yeah, I was pushing hard or whatever. But when I finished that race, I felt like I could have gone another ten miles, honestly.”","818","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"
"“I’m not afraid of failure,” Hall said later. “I don’t take it personally. So if I blow up, I’m bummed for sure, but it’s like, life goes on. It doesn’t define me. So I’m not afraid to take big chances.”","819","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"

"“I like to go into a race not expecting anything,” he said. “Not expecting to feel like a million bucks. Not expecting to hit certain splits or the race to unfold a certain way.” He went on, “I like to go into a race with not a real strong, set game plan, but just knowing that I’m going to take my swing at some point in the race, and then see what happens.”","821","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-philosophy-of-ryan-hall"
"“I think that believing who you are, knowing who you are before the race is so important,” Hall said at one point. “A lot of athletes are trying to prove themselves through their performances.

The sign, which bears the simple caption “BÍRAN,” depicts two old men in green fatigues. One of the men, Raúl Castro, made a New Year’s visit, two weeks ago, to hail the start of a new Cuban era, and to return to the rural idyll where he and his ailing brother, Fidel, were raised. Their father, Ángel, was a Spanish immigrant who arrived poor in Cuba, in the early nineteen-hundreds, then grew rich by buying land and selling sugarcane, cut for pennies by hard-driven workers, to the United Fruit Company. After the Castros won power, in 1959, and promised to break up Cuba’s large holdings, they turned their father’s lands over to the peasants they’d watched him whip. This has always been one of their core claims to socialist integrity—and it’s one reason why Bíran would always rank high, if Pew’s pollsters came here, in loyalty to its famed sons’ Communist Party.","828","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"

"The first of January in Cuba marks not only the start of a new year, but also the anniversary of Fidel’s bravura speech, in the country’s main eastern city, Santiago, in which he declared victory in the revolution. For years afterward, he made addressing his people en masse a New Year’s rite. But Raúl isn’t Fidel, and in Bíran he made no speech. Instead, he continued what had been a notably muted set of weeks since his hugely popular accord with Barack Obama, which reëstablished diplomatic ties between their governments, after fifty-three years of estrangement. Following some initial prisoner releases (which Jon Lee Anderson wrote about earlier this week), the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments made good on many other commitments of the accord on Thursday, relaxing a number of travel, banking, and export regulations.","830","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"
"Raúl marked the New Year the same way that most Cubans did: by visiting friends and eating some pork. His quiet response marked a dramatic shift in Cuba’s political culture. For decades here, no important moment in the Communist Party’s larger narrative of the revolution was allowed to pass without a massive demonstration in one of Havana’s huge squares or elsewhere on the island. Whether it was the return of Elián González from Miami, or of sporting heroes from the Pan-Am games, confrontations with the United States were underscored by a summoning of the faithful, with schoolkids bussed in to wave little flags and to chant, along with their old leader, “We Will Win!” Yet although the Communist Party declared, with the recent accord, “We won the war,” there was no massive acto.","831","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"
"Part of the reason was, no doubt, the holidays, a season during which Cuba’s streets are hung with signs marking another year of revolución, but which sees the island’s usual slow pace amble to an easy halt for days full of domino-playing, rum-drinking, and, if you can afford it, on New Year’s Eve, a suckling pig roasting in the yard. It also had to do with Raúl’s personal style—he has never had his brother’s charisma or oratory will, and isn’t given to gathering large crowds. But it was hard not to feel that it all came back to Fidel’s absence. As recently as October, Granma, the Cuban Communist Party’s official organ, ran a “reflection” from the Comandante about a New York Times editorial that urged action along the lines that Obama eventually took (Fidel’s reply: favorable, but prickly). Were he physically and mentally able, it was hard to imagine that the elder Castro wouldn’t make at least a quick public bow. But the word from party insiders with whom I spoke in Havana matches what’s been surmised by rumor-millers on the street—last week brought a new round of death rumors—and is the same, too, as what I heard from the Castros’ last remaining relative in Bíran.","832","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"
"The old ranch there where the Castro boys grew up, with its raised Galician-style house and numerous wooden outbuildings, has recently been restored—with the help of foreign foundations—and turned into a desultory tourist trap whose most interesting feature is also its newest. Around a pair of raised granite tombs containing the remains of Ángel Castro and his last wife lies a semi-circle of stone cubbies engraved with the names of his kids—or eight of them, anyway. The friendly soldier who showed me the site explained to me that Fidel and Raúl had no cubbies, because “they’ll be buried elsewhere.” He did allow that one of Ángel’s other sons was not enshrined here—he’d been born to a field hand—and that he was still alive and living nearby. I found Martin Castro, who is eighty-six, in a modest concrete home off of Bíran’s main drag. After we agreed that the new deal with America was a great thing, I asked after his older brother’s health, and his blue eyes flashed the same shade as Fidel’s. “Es muy mal,” he said. He’s very sick.","833","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"
"The perception in Cuba of Fidel’s abiding presence behind the throne has been a key to Raúl’s steady hand in weathering frustrations at home—Cubans were livid, for example, at his government’s recent raising of the retirement age, from fifty-five to sixty for women, and from sixty to sixty-five for men. But it was Fidel’s absence that may have allowed Raúl to forge the new relationship with Washington; behind the scenes, his pragmatism no doubt came to the fore. Many aspects of the détente seem to counter the more cynical interests of the Cuban state—notably initiatives to improve Internet capacity and allow U.S. foundations and churches to fund their Cuban counterparts. A big part of the calculus informing Cuba’s new openness to the U.S., though, is about economic necessity. With Cuba’s birth rate having fallen below replacement level as far back as 1980 (partly thanks to Cuban women’s universal access to reproductive health and abortions), and its work force shrinking, the country’s vaunted health system faces pressing concerns about how it will care for the huge number of citizens readying to retire. Simply put, Cuba’s economic planners realized long ago that their socialist system couldn’t survive without more sources of foreign cash.","834","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"
"Every person I spoke with in Bíran echoed the feelings about the accord expressed by Flori Suarez, a math teacher at the town’s state-run school. “We’ve always seen the American people as our friends,” said Suarez, whose father once toiled as a machatero for Ángel Castro and United Fruit. “So we’re very happy to be unified at last.”","835","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"
"But Cubans, too, are concerned about what Raúl, whose own term ends in 2018, may do to “correct” their economy. From Bíran, I rattled on to Santiago in a ’55 Ford Fairlane with a rebuilt Russian engine. Its driver, Roberto Reyes, wondered whether Raúl would move to do away with the country’s byzantine system of having two currencies in circulation—one for Cubans, and another for tourists and packaged goods. Invoking a popular rumor, Reyes said he feared the introduction of a new Cuban peso pegged not to the U.S. dollar—at the moment that Cubans gain new access to Yankee greenbacks—but to the SUCRE, a currency used by its South American allies in the Venezuela-led ALBA trading block.","836","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"
"However this unfolds, it is clear that Cuba’s new era won’t be narrated for its people by the country’s longtime narrator-in-chief. Not that many young Cubans miss him. In the country’s agrarian east, where the Castros grew up and launched their revolution, history has long felt more present than it has in Havana. The ’55 Ford in which we rode, Reyes told me, had been personally given to his father by Raúl Castro, in 1958, after his guerrillas had captured Cuba’s second city and some fleeing Batista supporter had left it in the street. But to most young people here, like most young people everywhere, the achievements and memories of their great-grandparents are secondary to their own hopes.","837","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"
"In Santiago, where few tourists go, the new semi-capitalist Cuba is coming slowly—and many of the younger Cubans I spoke with on its hot streets, near where the Castros attended boarding school in the shade of the Sierra Maestra, expressed the desire to have a greater role in the future of their country. “The changes with the United States are very positive,” José Daniel Ferrer, the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba, a leading dissident group, told me. “But the important thing, here, is to be our own protagonists in what happens next.”","838","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"
"For many years, it was Fidel Castro’s political genius to convince many Cubans that they were, along with him and his party, already the protagonists. How and whether Cuba’s current leaders manage to maintain or evolve this pattern—by involving their grandkids in shaping the country’s future, or else getting out of the way—is the hinge on which Cuba’s new era will turn. How will Cuba’s ruling party and its dictates fare when two of its key foundations—the hostility of the United States, on which it has blamed so many problems; and the presence of Fidel—are no more?","839","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/news-fidel-raul-castros-home-town-cuba"

"Now that the illustrator Tomi Ungerer is back—and this was the feeling at the opening of the wonderful new exhibition “Tomi Ungerer: All in One,” up through March 22nd at the Drawing Center—it seems worth looking again at how he went away. Ungerer was sent away, really, his books banned, removed from libraries, and not reviewed in, for instance, the Times, after he was deemed too offensive as an artist. It was a break that was not his fault, though he certainly didn’t help matters and still seems to blame himself for it, judging from his remembrances in the documentary “Far Out Isn’t Far Enough,” which came out in limited release in 2013 and is now available to stream. In the documentary, Ungerer remembers the break as having begun at an American Library Association conference in 1969. “You can really pinpoint exactly the moment that my multiple activities came out into the open,” he says. “It all happened in this one evening, at a children’s-book convention, and I had to say a few words.”","February 4, 2015","841","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"To do so, he arrived at the conference in what may have been a costume. It seemed like one, anyway, to some of the librarians in attendance, many of them his fans. He appeared to be dressed as one of the robbers from his book “The Three Robbers,” a typical Ungerer work in that the title characters aren’t deemed to be as bad as maybe a seventeenth-century New England Calvinist might want them to be, and operate in what a textual theorist would refer to as a liminal area, the no man’s lands where good and bad get confused—a reason kids like them. Up until his remarks at the A.L.A. conference, Ungerer had co-existed in several worlds at once, working brilliantly in each. He was doing advertising work for the Ice Capades, the New York State lottery, the Village Voice, and the Times—often providing a certain bawdiness, or at least titillation. Ads for the Electric Circus, an East Village night club, featured men and women plugging appliances into sexually appropriate places.","842","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"","843","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"These ads were drawn in 1969 and the club closed in 1971, within a year of Ungerer’s appearance at the A.L.A. conference; sadly, they are not featured in the show, though a series of now iconic anti-Vietnam War posters that Columbia University had commissioned (and then rejected as too harsh) are. “Eat” features the Statue of Liberty being shoved down a (yellow) man’s throat. Ungerer would later credit the graphic ferocity of his work to having grown up in Nazi-occupied Alsace. “The irony is, this is a style that I got from Hitler,” he says. “My Vietnam posters, I did them all one day in a total state of anger, one after the other.”","844","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"Jules Feiffer is interviewed in the documentary, and praises the posters above all. “As brilliant as the kids’ books are, and as brilliant as his other work, when I see them reproduced still I find those political posters from the sixties shocking to look at,” he says. Feiffer remembers a different work atmosphere for artists and writers. “Everybody lived in such separate universes in those years, and there wasn’t an Internet,” he says. “One could go on living two or three different kinds of lives and doing all this different work and get away with it for a long, long time.”","845","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"What Ungerer was getting away with was making erotic drawings, and what seemed to irritate people, in particular, were drawings for a book he called “Fornicon,” published in 1969. He was also taking apart and reassembling Barbies, but it’s not clear that the librarians knew about that nor would have known what to say; in 1973, after all, shortly after Ungerer’s appearance at the A.L.A. conference, the association sponsored a petition asking librarians (primarily in Louisiana and Pennsylvania) not to paint diapers on Maurice Sendak’s Mickey, the unclothed hero of “In the Night Kitchen,” or to rip out the page in “Sylvester and the Magic Pebble,” a book about a donkey (or maybe an ass) that features helpful and courteous police officers who are pigs. Around 1973, fears of pornography convictions were also causing bookstores and libraries to get rid of books, under a new Supreme Court guidelines on obscenity.","846","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"As they are, Ungerer’s erotic drawings would probably not make John Singer Sargent blush. But “Fornicon” could be construed as pornographic if you missed the satire: it’s an attack on the mechanization of sex, its de-personalization and commercialization, from an artist whose offices overlooked Times Square before Disney and the Empire State Development Corporation got hold of it. Of course, there is the possibility that when Ungerer arrived, robber-dressed, to speak at that A.L.A. conference, some of the librarians in attendance might have heard about his ultra-raucous behavior at legendary parties in a legendary-party era. But children’s librarians especially ought to have been able to see him as a forever teen-ager, always acting up in class, exploding propane containers, putting pebbles in burgers that sent the Sag Harborians to their dentists. The late Sendak ends up as the star of the Ungerer documentary, and he describes his friend’s transgressions as a gift and a curse:","847","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"When Ungerer stood at the podium on that fateful (in his mind) day, he was suddenly hit with questions that, one has to think, he knew were coming. “And somebody in the audience attacked me,” he recalls. When he recounts this event in the documentary, he is in his studio at his current home, in Western Ireland. He also lives in Strasbourg, where he is interviewed in a room full of sex toys, his personal collection. Strasbourg is home to the Tomi Ungerer Museum, which includes work by Ungerer as well as by his family, renowned clockmakers. You can see this genetic obsession with gadgetry in all his work, children’s books and “Fornicon” alike.","848","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"But Ungerer crossed a line at the A.L.A. event, as the crowd pushed him—asking how dare he draw “Fornicon” and children’s books. “They really went after me,” he recounts, seemingly over the moment until he adds, “Really, like a pack of bitches.” What he says happened was—and a librarian who knew others at the event confirms his story—he got angry. “When I really blow up, then I’m blind, really blind—blind with anger,” he says. “Stupidly, I use the word that you certainly shouldn’t use anyway, especially in those days, and I said to defend myself, ‘If people didn’t fuck, you wouldn’t have any children, and without children you would be out of work.’ And that went, of course, very badly, especially with the word F-U-C-K.”","849","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"His punishment was to be effectively blacklisted in America, his books taken from libraries, his children’s publishing career in America over. His penance was to leave town. With his third wife, Yvonne—whom he met on the subway as she was on her way to work at the Children’s Book Council—he moved, on a whim, to Nova Scotia, subsistence living that produced a beautiful journal of painting and writing, “Far Out Isn’t Far Enough,” from which the documentary takes its name. The book, set in a beat-up and wild coastal town (the police station had been boarded up), sees in nature and farming all of Ungerer’s favorite subjects: blood and gore, sex and, mostly, death. In real life, the exiled couple had children and, as often happens, the rebel-turned-parent proceeded to look for order. “When we decided to have children,” he says, “we just realized that no way you would have children in such an unstable milieu.”","850","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"The documentary gives the impression that, even in an orderly milieu, Ungerer as a father is still fear-wracked by his youth under Nazi occupation, which is described in detail in the film and, in the exhibit, evidenced in his drawings under Nazi tutelage. These are the roots of his fear of censorship and state-sponsored brainwashing. He says:","851","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"He continued his commercial work in Europe, and he made books about death (“Rigor Mortis”) and a brothel in Hamburg (“Guardian Angels of Hell”), and championed the rights of Hamburg sex workers. He promoted the European Union and illustrated for Reporters with Borders, including a 1992 poster featured in the show. Also featured is a crucified Statue of Liberty, drawn in response to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Here it is worth noting that the Statue of Liberty was designed by Frédéric Bartholdi, a native of Colmar, where Ungerer lived under the Nazis and then the French, who, after taking back control from the Nazis, burned the German classics—Schiller, Geothe, et al. “When you are faced with this kind of historical contradiction, what is liberation?” Ungerer asks. “What is fascism? What is dictatorial? And this is what I found out as a child very, very early. Everything is just absurd. The war is absurd. People are absurd. The grownups are absurd.”","852","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"On the show’s opening night, the Drawing Center was packed with people, mostly in the front room, and his bondage drawings and “Fornicon” pieces are in the back room, where, to not offend, they seemed to take on offense, proving that in America we are still afraid to admit to our kids that we have sex, a fear made more pathetic in that they typically could care less. Fortunately, Ungerer’s large drawings of the Nova Scotia landscape are given big play, each with a caption from Proverbs. And the pages of “Moon Man” are still shocking, in their deep use of blue and black; it is a dark book, literally, that reeks of ingenuity and crafty harmony and charm.","853","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"Ungerer was at the Drawing Center opening, too, dressed in black—standing at first, like a tall robber, and then, after somebody wheeled out an office chair, sitting, a glass of wine like a chalice in his hand as he beamed. A few years ago, he returned to New York; the documentary shows him reading to children from his then just-published American reprints, and visiting his old West Village place. Then there were no crowds greeting him. Seeing him hold court at the Drawing Center suggested that he had beaten the anger that inflames him in the film.","854","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"He sat against a wall displaying the unexpected high notes of the Drawing Center’s exhibit. The nudes are good but not exceptional, and some of the illustrations suffer from what many illustrations suffer from—a loss of confidence when shifting from the page to the wall. On the other hand, there are seven small illustrations that have never been seen, and are themselves little Ungerer miracles. They are job work, done for a German pharmaceutical company, each depicting aspects of depression. In one, the floor of a room gives way. In another, a man looks despairingly up an endless staircase. In the only titled piece, “Fear of Feelings,” a man cowers at the sight of a small flower. They are phenomenologically correct dissections of an all-consuming sadness, important treasures that he seems to have brought back from a dark place.","855","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/tomi-ungerers-triumphant-return"
"On January 18th, just before midnight, an Argentine state prosecutor named Alberto Nisman turned up dead in his apartment. The cause of death was a shot to the head, fired from a .22-calibre pistol that the prosecutor had borrowed from his assistant the day before. Nisman told his assistant that an Argentine spy had warned him that his life was in danger. The two main doors to the apartment were locked, and several bodyguards had been standing watch outside. Analysis of a third passageway, a small nook used to gain access to the apartment’s air-conditioning unit, revealed a footprint and a smudge, but nothing more. The door to the bathroom, where Nisman was found, was locked from the inside. It looked like he had killed himself, but could someone else have made him do it?","January 31, 2015","856","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"

"Four days before Nisman died, he had accused President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her Foreign Minister, Héctor Timerman, of a spectacular crime. The two were the “authors and accomplices of an aggravated cover-up and obstruction of justice,” Nisman told a Buenos Aires court. They had allegedly protected the perpetrators of the bombing, in 1994, of a Jewish community center, the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA). The attack, which left eighty-five people dead and hundreds injured, was the worst in the country’s recent history. Nisman had spent more than ten years investigating the case, and he had long believed that the Iranian government and agents of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, were behind it. In recent years, he had also become concerned that Kirchner’s government had conspired to shield them from justice. (The case is still unresolved and the attack’s perpetrators remain unpunished.)","858","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"Nisman had produced a two-hundred-and-eighty-nine-page report that, drawing on wiretapped conversations between a union leader aligned with Kirchner and an Iranian official, claimed that Kirchner and Timerman had secretly met in 2013 with the Iranians to broker a deal. According to Nisman, the Argentines had agreed to give up their hunt for the terrorists in exchange for Iranian oil. The government immediately dismissed the accusations as baseless, but opposition legislators seized on Nisman’s pronouncement and called on him to testify before Congress. He died the night before he was supposed to deliver that testimony. In his final hours, he tried and failed to insure that the congressional hearings were closed to the public. “I might get out of this dead,” he said.","859","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"Hours after news of Nisman’s death broke, protesters took to the streets with signs that read, “Yo soy Nisman,” to express their anger over his death; many accused the government of orchestrating it. The government, meanwhile, did little to dispel the suspicion. The next day, Kirchner posted a rambling message on Facebook, which read, in part, “Suicide provokes … first: stupefaction, and then questions. What is it that brought a person to the terrible decision to end his life?” Four days later, she was less philosophical, and more portentous. Nisman’s death “was not a suicide,” Kirchner wrote on her Web site. “They used [Nisman] while he was alive, then they needed him dead.” The “they” in this case could have included government critics who wanted to frame the President; a rogue faction of the Argentine intelligence apparatus; the Central Intelligence Agency; or the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. The President’s public pronouncements are often soaked in paranoia. But in this case, the government’s line—that Nisman was manipulated, then discarded, by elements of the intelligence community intent on discrediting Kirchner—traded on widely held doubts about Nisman’s independence as an investigator.","860","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"Nisman never had the institutional means to determine, on his own, whether the Iranian government had a role in the AMIA bombing. Instead, his information came largely from the former Argentine director of counterintelligence Antonio (Jaime) Stiusso. Stiusso’s information, which steadily implicated the President in some nefarious détente with Iran, is widely thought to have come from U.S. and Israeli intelligence services. One theory that has gained ground since Nisman’s killing turns on Stiusso and his agenda in feeding Nisman damning evidence against the government. “Stiusso had two faces,” the Argentine journalist Santiago O’Donnell told me. “The good Stiusso had the face of the prosecutor Nisman. The bad Stiusso did not have a face and was a shady and powerful person who instilled great fear.” Back in 2004, the Justice Minister held up a photograph of Stiusso on television and accused him of presiding over a “kind of Gestapo” that intimidated and blackmailed politicians. The President ousted Stiusso last year, and his departure posed problems for Nisman and the investigation. At the moment, Stiusso’s whereabouts are unknown.","861","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"This theory that Stiusso was somehow directing Nisman’s investigation is riddled with conjecture. But the notion that Nisman was a kind of cipher for Argentine and foreign-intelligence operatives has its roots in certain demonstrable facts. Diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks reveal that Nisman obsessively consulted with the American Embassy. He went to the Embassy with advance tips on his investigation, he shared knowledge about judges’ leanings, and he showed Embassy officials drafts of his arrest orders and made revisions based on their comments. In October, 2006, Nisman formally accused Iranian officials and a Hezbollah operative of orchestrating the AMIA attack. U.S. Embassy representatives told Nisman that they were “convinced” his case was solid, and “congratulated” the Argentine prosecutors for their “dedication.” Some of the same cables refer to U.S. efforts to impose international sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program, a campaign that the Argentine government joined at the United Nations.","862","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"This enthusiasm for the case against Iran is particularly noteworthy because Iran and Hezbollah were never the only suspected culprits in the bombing. Since the start of the investigation, there’s also been the so-called Syrian track, which suggests that Syrian agents may have underwritten the attack. The Argentine President at the time, Carlos Menem, was born in Argentina to Syrian immigrants, and had personal and political ties to the country. In 2008, in federal court, Nisman requested an arrest warrant for Menem and his brother because they’d allegedly impeded the investigation into a Syrian man thought to have been involved in the bombing. One federal investigator went so far as to testify under oath that the case against the Syrian suspect was never pursued because Menem’s brother called the judge and quashed the inquiry. (Menem denied any malfeasance, saying that the charges amounted to “political persecution.”) Nisman eventually dropped this line of investigation and apologized to American authorities for introducing it without warning. The Syrian theory may never have been entirely solid, but its swift abandonment was suggestive. “Today, the Syrian track is more of a political debate than a legal one,” the Argentine political scientist Juan Gabriel Tokatlian told me earlier this week.","863","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"The AMIA investigation has lasted twenty years and spanned more than three Presidential administrations. During that time, the original investigating judge, the former head of the Argentine intelligence services, some of the prosecutors, police officers, and the former head of an AMIA-affiliated organization have all been charged with wrongdoing. Four Buenos Aires police officers were arrested for overseeing a stolen-car ring that included the vehicle thought to have been used in the AMIA bombing, but they were acquitted in 2004, when it emerged that the investigating judge had paid a four-hundred-thousand-peso bribe to a key witness for the prosecution. The money for the bribe came from the state secretary of intelligence.","864","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"The AMIA case confirmed the public’s worst fears about the courts. Since the years of the military dictatorship, they have been under the thumb of the intelligence service, which has routinely made use of its telephone-surveillance arm to coddle and control judges. Because of the welter of procedural irregularities, Interpol, at one point, lifted its red notices, or international arrest warrants, for the twelve Iranian nationals initially alleged to have been responsible for the bombing. Nisman was part of the original investigation team, but was never directly implicated in the impropriety. In 2004, President Néstor Kirchner, who called the botched investigation a “national disgrace,” appointed Nisman to head up a new investigation. His findings, released two years later, renewed the claims of the earlier investigation against Iran and Hezbollah.","865","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"In 2012, President Cristina Kirchner began charting a new foreign-policy course that set her and Nisman at odds. “There was a broader shift in foreign policy away from the U.S. and Europe,” Daniel Kerner, the head of the Latin American division at Eurasia Group, told me. Some of this was owing to the U.S. recession and the European debt crisis, some of it to Argentina’s continued trouble with U.S. courts over debt owed to American hedge funds. The Argentine government felt less beholden to Western powers, and softened its position on Iran. “There were always doubts about the accusations against Iran,” Kerner said. “At some point, the Kirchner government may have just recognized that these accusations were a function of our closeness to the U.S.” In 2013, Cristina Kirchner’s government signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran, in which the two countries sought to create a truth commission to investigate the bombing. Critics lambasted her for aligning the government with the primary suspect.","866","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"In his report, Nisman alleged that the memorandum of understanding grew out of a trade deal for Iranian oil. As part of that deal, Argentina would request that Interpol withdraw its red notices on Iranian suspects. The former head of Interpol, Roland Noble, said that he was shocked to hear about this aspect of the alleged deal, and categorically denied any knowledge of it. (He even went so far as to produce earlier correspondence with Timerman, in which the two clearly agreed that the red notices had to remain in place.) State news agencies batted away the accusation that Argentina would barter for Iranian oil; the country needed refined, not crude, oil, which Iran couldn’t provide. There were other questions about the legitimacy of Nisman’s charges. He did not have the support of the local Jewish community, and he had circumvented the judge who had long presided over the AMIA case. Horacio Verbitsky, the president of the country’s leading human-rights group, the Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales, pointed out to me that only two pages of Nisman’s nearly three-hundred-page report concern the legal basis of the criminal charges against the President, which is striking considering the magnitude of the accusations.","867","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"The government’s erratic response to Nisman’s death created further confusion. The journalist who first reported the death, Damian Pachter, left Argentina for Israel last Saturday, claiming that his life was in danger. Inscrutably, the government posted Pachter’s flight information to its Twitter account, and said that it was trying to protect the journalist. At this point, it’s an open question whether this behavior is a sign of guilt or mere haplessness. Cristina Kirchner has since accused Nisman’s assistant of being an opponent of the government, with seemingly little basis; part of her evidence is that his brother works for a law firm with connections to a media conglomerate that has been critical of her administration.","868","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"
"More substantially, the Kirchner government announced the dissolution of the country’s notoriously corrupt intelligence secretariat. It’s unclear how, exactly, Kirchner intends to reform the intelligence apparatus, when, over the past couple of years, she has staffed its agencies with younger and more loyal officials. Eurasia Group’s Kerner, among others, described this as a common practice for presidents nearing the end of their terms; it’s possible that a raft of corruption cases awaits Kirchner when she leaves office, in December. Kirchner’s move has at least temporarily assuaged the longstanding concerns of Argentine human-rights activists about the intelligence secretariat’s interference in the justice system. But for now, it seems fitting that Kirchner, who’s been nursing a fractured foot, has been making her announcements from a wheelchair.","869","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman"

We commandeer cafeteria trays to go sledding, “The Power Broker” to prop open the door, the Internet to look at kittens. We do this with words as well—time was, spam was just Spam—but, lately, we have gone in for a particularly dramatic appropriation.

"Here’s Lena Dunham demonstrating this development, during a conversation with the comedian Marc Maron on his podcast “WTF.” The two are talking about people who reflexively disparage modern art:","872","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Dunham is twenty-eight years old, but the “No, totally!” phenomenon is not limited to her generation. It’s not even limited to “No, totally.” I first started noticing it when a fiftysomething acquaintance responded to a question I asked by saying, “Yup! No, very definitely.” That sent me looking for other examples, which turn out to be almost nonexistent in written English but increasingly abundant in speech. In 2001, the journalist Bernard Kalb told the White House correspondent Dana Milbank that it was the job of reporters to thoroughly investigate political candidates, to which Milbank responded, “Oh, no, yes, I agree with you there.” In 2012, Anderson Cooper, talking with the CNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger, referred to Newt Gingrich as “the guy who has come back from the dead multiple times.” Borger’s reply veered toward Molly Bloom terrain: “Yes, no, exactly, exactly, exactly.”","873","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"“No, totally.” “No, definitely.” “No, exactly.” “No, yes.” These curious uses turn “no” into a kind of contranym: a word that can function as its own opposite. Out of the million-odd words in the English language, perhaps a hundred have this property. You can seed a field, in which case you are adding seeds, or seed a grape, in which case you are subtracting them. You can be in a fix but find a fix for it. You can alight from a horse to observe a butterfly alighting on a flower.","874","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Such words—also called auto-antonyms, antagonyms, Janus words, and antiologies—can arise for different reasons. Some are just a special kind of homonym; what appears to be one word with two opposite meanings is really two different words with identical spellings and pronunciations. Thus “clip,” meaning “to attach together,” comes from the Anglo-Saxon clyppan, while “clip,” meaning “to cut off,” comes from the Old Norse klippa. Other contranyms arise when nouns becomes verbs. Sometime around 1200 A.D., dust turned into a verb and, as dust will do, went every which way: “to dust” can mean to remove dust, as from a bookshelf, or to add something dusty, as flour to a cake pan or snow to the streets of Brooklyn. Alternatively, a contranym can reverse meanings when it is used as a different part of speech. As a noun, “custom” refers to a behavior that is common to many people. As an adjective, it refers to something designed for just one person.","875","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Occasionally, however, a contranym arises through a process called amelioration, whereby a normally negative word develops a secondary, positive meaning. This phenomenon is particularly common in slang: “bad” becomes good, “wicked” becomes awesome, and “sick” and “ill” become wonderful. (They have been ameliorated: made better.) The use of “no” to mean “yes” appears to be an example of amelioration, but with one important distinction: “no” can’t mean “yes” on its own. Consider a slightly abridged version of Lena Dunham’s conversation about art appreciation:","876","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Take away the “totally” and Dunham appears to be rejecting anti-philistine violence. By contrast, you can take away the “no” without doing any evident semantic damage at all. A perfectly fine response to “Then you want to hit them” is “Totally”—or, for that matter, “Yes, totally,” or just “Yes.” In fact, every instance of “No, totally” and its kindred phrases can be replaced with “Yes,” without any disruption of grammar or meaning. So why do we sometimes use “no” instead?","877","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"At first blush, “no” does not appear to be the kind of word whose meaning you can monkey with. For one thing, there is its length. At just two letters and one syllable, it lacks the pliable properties of longer words. You can’t stuff stuff inside it. (You can say “unfreakingbelievable,” but you cannot say “nfreakingo.”) You can’t mangle it, à la “misunderestimate” or (the finest example I’ve heard lately) “haphazardous.” On the contrary, it is so simple and self-contained that it is a holophrasm, a word that can serve as a complete sentence. (Holophrasms aren’t common in English, but any verb in command form can be holophrastic—“Go,” “Help,” “Run”—and babies just learning to talk use single words to express complex ideas all the time, albeit without regard to grammar: “Ball,” “Up,” “Want.”) Moreover, the word has the apparent fixity and clarity of a logical operator: like “if,” “then,” “and,” “or,” and “not,” “no” seems designed to be unambiguous. When we ask, in the face of excessive pestering, “What part of ‘no’ don’t you understand?,” what we mean is: “Unless you are a complete cretin, there is no part of ‘no’ that you could possibly misunderstand.”","878","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Well, perhaps you would care to join me for a while in the land of complete cretinhood. For instance, answer me this, if you can: What part of speech is “no”? I thought it over for a while and concluded that it must be an interjection, even though it fails the Mad Libs test. (“The burglar bumped into the dresser and exclaimed, ‘_______, my toe!’ ” The last time someone filled in a blank like that with “no” was never.) At a generous estimate, I was only one-sixth correct—but, in my defense, “no” resists all ready grammatical categorization. It is not an interjection, except when it is. (“Oh, no, I missed the train.”) It is not a noun, except when it is. (“The nos have it.”) It is not an adjective, except when it is. (“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”) It is not an adverb, except when it is. (“I’m no clearer on this than I was when I began.”) Some linguists grant it the separate part-of-speech status of “sentence word,” because, as I noted, it can serve as a stand-alone sentence. Others consider it a particle—even though, as a rule, the point of particles is precisely that they can’t stand alone; they exist to affect the meaning of other words.","879","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"In addition to this grammatical ambiguity, “no” also sometimes suffers from semantic ambiguity—which is odd, considering that we regard it as absolute. But consider the question “You aren’t a fan of cilantro?” The answer “No” is confusing, since it can mean either “No, it tastes like dish soap” or “No, I adore it.” Some languages avoid this type of indeterminacy. In Japanese, for instance, hai and iie, although generally translated as “yes” and “no,” actually mean something closer to “That’s correct” and “That’s incorrect.” This eliminates the grey area. “You’re not a fan of cilantro?” “That’s incorrect,” you are a fan. In English, by contrast, we must resort to elaboration: “No, I like it fine, I just don’t want any on my pancakes.”","880","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Until the end of the sixteenth century or thereabouts, English had a tidier solution to this problem: we had two words for “no,” which we used in distinct ways. Those two words formed half of what’s called a four-form system of negation and affirmation. If you speak French (or, in a statistical unlikelihood, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, or Icelandic), you are familiar with a three-form system: in French, non can negate anything, oui is used only in response to positively phrased questions or statements, while si is used to contradict questions or statements phrased in the negative. In Franglish:","881","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Back when English was a four-form system, it, too, had a si—a word used specifically to contradict negative statements. That word was “yes.” To affirm positive statements, you used “yea”:","882","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Similarly, “nay” was used to respond to positive statements or questions, while “no” was reserved for contradicting anything phrased in the negative:","883","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Over time, the distinction withered, “yea” and “nay” became obsolete, and “yes” and “no”—the words that started out as special cases, for responding exclusively to negatives—came to hold their current status. Or, as the case may be, statuses.","884","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"What does all this have to do with the strange case of “No, totally”? The linguists I spoke with thought that this use of “no” might be a response to an implicit or explicit negative in the preceding statement: the type of “no” we used back when we also had “nay.” In modern English, you need to use something to clear up the cilantro-style confusion—so why not “totally” or its ilk? Here’s ABC News’s Joy Behar talking to the comedian Ricky Gervais about how girls, unlike boys, are not encouraged to make fools of themselves in public:","885","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"Because Behar’s statement is negative, either “yes” or “no” on its own would be a confusing response. Gervais chooses “no,” then has to add “exactly, yes” to indicate that he doesn’t mean “No, Joy, you’re wrong.” You could argue that there’s also a negative, this one implicit, in the exchange between Mark Maron and Lena Dunham. By that logic, Maron is really saying, “You want to hit them [because these guys don’t know anything about art],” and Dunham’s reply means, “No, they don’t, I totally agree.”","886","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"In suggesting this negation theory of “No, totally,” linguists are borrowing from their far more developed explanation of a seemingly similar expression: “Yeah, no.” The “no” in that phrase is generally thought to retain its customary negative function. I’m a little dubious about whether that’s the whole story, but it doesn’t matter, because I’m going to ignore “Yeah, no” here. For one thing, those who are interested can refer to what the Oxford English Dictionary lexicographer Jesse Sheidlower called “the extensive ‘Yeah, no’ literature.” (An excellent place to start is this three-part analysis by the University of Pennsylvania linguistics professor Mark Liberman.) For another, the comparison only gets us just so far—because in many examples of “No, totally!” there doesn’t seem to be any negation whatsoever. Consider:","887","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"In this case and many others like it, “No, totally” appears to be all affirmation—a surprised and happy seconding. A rough translation might be, “Wow, that’s just how I feel!”","888","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"We’ve been using “no” to express surprise, including happy surprise, for a very long time. You hear that use in “No way!” You hear it (or heard it) in the early-aughts slang “Oh no you di’int!”And you hear it in “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,” after Tom asks Huck Finn what you can do with a dead cat. Why, you can use it to cure warts, Huck replies. “No! Is that so?” Tom exclaims. Here, “no” is again serving as an interjection, akin to the “damn” in the phrase, “Damn, that’s smart”—“damn” being another normally negative word that can sometimes swap polarity and become positive. With both “damn” and “no,” the slimmest hint of the negative might linger, in the form of envious admiration. But, for the most part, this enthusiastic “no” has very little negative meaning, or really much semantic content at all. It is more like verbal punctuation—like the initial, upside-down exclamation mark in Spanish that alerts you to impending excitement: ¡Totally!","889","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"I don’t mean to suggest that animated agreement singlehandedly explains all instances of “No, totally,” or that the negation theory is wrong. The way we use language is so variable and versatile that Occam’s razor does not apply; both explanations might easily be correct, and several others as well. In some cases, the expression might simply function as a conversational hinge—“No, totally, but what I was going to say was…”—akin to the empty but rudder-like “no” in that phrase comedians love to deploy immediately after jokes: “No, but seriously, folks.” Or maybe—and this is the theory I like best, but can least substantiate—“No, totally” is really a contraction of “I know, totally.” That is linguistically improbable; I know of no instance in the English language where a homophonic slippage of this sort has taken place. But I like the theory anyway, because it captures what is often the semantic intent of “No, totally” with uncanny precision: I understand, and I am fully in accord.","890","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"And, ultimately, it is the semantics that counts. If we are turning words inside-out to create more ways to agree with one another, I am all for it. No language could have too many ways to express the pleasure of emotional, aesthetic, and intellectual connection—or, for that matter, too many ways to simply say yes. Saying yes as often as possible is, famously, the first rule of improv, vital to maintaining energy, imagination, and humor. It is also, I have long thought, a sure sign that you’re falling in love, not to mention crucial to sustaining that love over the long haul. And, while sometimes impractical, dangerous, or just plain dumb, saying yes to as much stuff as possible is, over all, a pretty good strategy for getting through life.","891","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"
"In the course of investigating this subject, I called up Shaun Lau, who hosts, together with Brian Hanson, the film-criticism podcast “No, Totally!” When I asked Lau how he came to choose the name, he told me that he was bored with critical conversations in which people who disagreed spoke past each other to try to score points with the audience. “It just didn’t seem interesting to me to be another guy arguing with another guy,” he said. But nor was he interested in predictable or polite agreement. The phrase “No, totally!” seemed to suggest, instead, genuine engagement: a startled, joyful discovery of common ground. To use it, he said, “You have to be in a conversation that has a certain level of passion.”","892","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-part-of-no-totally-dont-you-understand"

The directors of a conviction-review unit he formed early last year had just explained their recommendation that he move to vacate Derrick Hamilton’s 1993 second-degree-murder conviction, for which Hamilton had served nearly twenty-one years in prison before being let out on parole.

In March of that year, Hamilton was arrested for the murder. He was twenty-seven at the time, and had previously been convicted of manslaughter, but was out on parole. Detectives on the case relied largely on one eyewitness, Jewel Smith, Cash’s girlfriend, to build their case. Although she had told the first detective on the scene that she hadn’t seen the shooting, she ultimately identified Hamilton as the murderer; at trial, he was found guilty, and he received a sentence of twenty-five years to life in prison.","894","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"

Following Hamilton’s conviction, in 1993, he and his lawyers maintained this narrative—to no effect, even after Smith recanted her testimony. In 2011, Hamilton was released on parole, with his conviction still in place, and in January, 2014, prompted by Hamilton’s lawyers, Thompson’s office began reviewing the case.","896","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"One day last year, Mark Hale, the assistant district attorney who runs the Kings County conviction-review unit, visited the scene of the Cash murder. In Smith’s account, which prosecutors had relied on to convict Hamilton, she had said that Hamilton shot Cash in the chest while they were standing in the entrance of the brownstone. She claimed that Cash then walked out of the house and up some stairs, then collapsed on the curb of the sidewalk, where he died.","897","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"Hale already had reason to doubt the account. There was Smith’s recantation, for one, and, what’s more, forensic evidence had contradicted her assertion that Cash had been shot in the chest while standing in the building. When Hale saw the brownstone, his suspicions increased. The vestibule was only about six feet wide and five and a half feet deep, a setting inconsistent with ballistics evidence and the medical examiner’s report. Neither Cash’s body nor his clothes had shown evidence of a close-range shooting, and the location of the discharged shell casings indicated that the shooter had stood in the vestibule and shot outward, in the direction of the street. Hale also saw that Cash would have had to walk down a set of stairs, contradicting Smith’s assertion.* Moreover, Cash’s autopsy found evidence of injuries that would have made it impossible for him to walk after the fatal shot.","898","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"

"The Conviction Review Unit has been the most profound reform that Thompson has implemented in his year as district attorney. A team of ten lawyers has been tasked with reviewing wrongful-conviction claims and questionable convictions, many of which occurred under the leadership of the previous D.A., Charles Hynes, whose twenty-three-year tenure is suspected of being marked by negligence and questionable ethics—including using faulty eyewitnesses, manipulating his prosecutorial responsibilities in order to appear tough on crime and win elections, and relying on the work of discredited detectives. One retired detective in particular, Louis Scarcella, has been connected with roughly seventy cases that have come up for review by Thompson’s office, including Hamilton’s. Meanwhile, one of Hynes’s assistant district attorneys, Michael Vecchione, was named in a wrongful-conviction lawsuit brought against the city by Jabbar Collins, who spent sixteen years in prison for murder. Collins claimed that Vecchione and others in the prosecutor’s office had threatened a man in order to solicit testimony of Collins’s guilt.

Both Scarcella and Vecchione deny any wrongdoing.)","900","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"The C.R.U. represents Thompson’s attempt to correct systemic flaws in Brooklyn’s criminal-justice apparatus, which have included poor oversight, inadequate independent review, and a lack of prosecutorial and police transparency—and which have enabled problems ranging from mistakes in judgment to deliberate misconduct. Thompson’s is the third-largest district attorney’s office in the nation, behind those of Chicago and Los Angeles, with five hundred prosecutors who litigate roughly a hundred thousand cases a year, and it is certainly the largest to make such a thorough effort to review past convictions. In scope, the Kings Country C.R.U. follows an earlier effort by Craig Watkins, the district attorney in Dallas, who, in 2006, formed a conviction-integrity unit that sought, at first, to review potentially tainted convictions that could be tested with DNA evidence that wasn’t available at the time of the original trials.","901","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"Thompson’s unit differed from Watkins’s in that it sought to consider an expanded notion of justice. “They’re not simply looking at wrongful convictions in cases in which a person can prove his or her innocence. They’re also looking at cases where they may be innocent—we don’t know—but, definitely, the conviction has no integrity,” Peter Neufeld, the cofounder of the Innocence Project, told me. Watkins later expanded his unit in Dallas to include convictions not resting on DNA evidence, but Thompson’s office has not yet widened its scope to include cases in which retroactive DNA testing can be applied. Rather, the questionable convictions that the Kings County office has sought to review can largely be traced to human error—negligence, misconduct, or errors in judgment—and not necessarily to poor technology. “It is much more difficult to set aside convictions in non-DNA cases, so Kenneth Thompson’s work in that regard has been especially impressive,” Karen Daniel, the co-director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at the Northwestern University School of Law, wrote to me in an e-mail.","902","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"Thompson talks about justice with a more philosophical tone than one might expect from an elected official. “I believe that too many D.A.s view their duty as to convict,” he told me. “I think that the main duty of the D.A. is to do justice. That means to protect public safety, but it also means that we have to ensure that our criminal-justice system is based on fundamental fairness.” Thompson, who is forty-eight, spent his early childhood in Harlem’s Wagner Houses. In 1973, his mother became a New York City police officer, which allowed her to move her three children to the Co-Op City neighborhood of the Bronx. “My mother was part of the first group of women—black or white—to go on patrol in the history of the city,” Thompson told me. “To think that she could become a police officer in 1973, when there were no examples for her, was really extraordinary. She left an indelible impression on me about law enforcement, about issues of fairness and justice.”","903","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"Among the artwork hanging on Thompson’s office walls is a framed courtroom sketch of his opening statement in the 1997 trial of Justin Volpe, an N.Y.P.D. officer accused of beating and sodomizing a Haitian immigrant named Abner Louima. Thompson was an assistant U.S. attorney at the time, part of a team of federal prosecutors who litigated the case and ultimately secured a guilty verdict against Volpe. His involvement in the Louima case speaks to his awareness that the system is not always right, and that justice ought to be applied to everyone—an awareness that has carried into his aims in forming the C.R.U. “Wrongful convictions, for a lot of reasons, destroy the lives of the people who have been wrongfully convicted, and their family members,” Thompson told me. “But they also do damage to the integrity of the system.”","904","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"In January, 2014, Thompson began the process of recruiting Ron Sullivan to assist in designing his new unit. Sullivan had previously been the chief executive officer for the Public Defender Service, in Washington, D.C., which provides legal representation for indigent citizens. The decision to work with Sullivan was akin to Thompson hiring a defensive specialist to be his football team’s offensive coördinator. But the move added to the legitimacy and seriousness of the unit, and Sullivan, who is also a professor at Harvard Law School and the director of the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute, brought a theoretical approach to the project that matched Thompson’s ruminative disposition. When I asked Sullivan to explain what it means to “do justice”—a phrase several people in the C.R.U. use—he said, “The person who’s the best advocate can prevail with a conviction even if the evidence doesn’t warrant it. Under a justice regime, the notion here is that we’re looking for the correct result, the right result. That’s what prosecutors are duty-bound to do in the first instance.” To that end, Brooklyn’s C.R.U. was designed to work alongside an independent review panel, made up of attorneys who don’t work for the D.A.’s office, that makes its own recommendations to Thompson.","905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"According to Hale, the unit has accepted about a hundred cases for review since March, 2014, and has made a determination in thirty-one. Most of the cases that the unit has handled so far involve crimes that were committed in the early nineteen-nineties, during the highest period of criminal activity in the history of Brooklyn, which were also Hynes’s first years as D.A. The highest priority for the unit, Thompson says, is to give freedom to people who were convicted during the concomitant era of mass incarceration but don’t belong in prison. He likens the work of the C.R.U. to that of a hospital’s triage center.","906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"For the moment, two important challenges remain outside the scope of Thompson’s unit: understanding precisely why mistakes happened and instituting measures to prevent wrongful convictions from happening in the future. Neufeld argues that the means for accomplishing these goals already exists. “The only sector in society which has not used root-cause analysis”—a formal methodology for determining the source of an undesirable result—“routinely to deal with its issues has been the criminal-justice system,” he said. “And I don’t want to single D.A.s out. It’s true of public defenders; it’s true of crime laboratories; it’s true of police departments; it’s true of the courts.”","907","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"In 2011, Brandon Garrett published a book called “Convicting the Innocent,” which assessed two hundred and fifty cases in which defendants were later exonerated based on post-conviction DNA testing. The book’s aim was to better understand the flaws in prosecutorial functions and recommend reforms—to perform the kind of root-cause analysis Neufeld would like to see more of from officials. “The trial records in these cases give us every reason to believe that most of the police, prosecutors, forensic analysts, defense lawyers, judges, and jurors acted in good faith,” Garrett writes. “They may have suffered from the everyday phenomenon of cognitive bias, meaning that they unconsciously discounted evidence of innocence because it was inconsistent with their prior view of the case, or they were motivated to think of themselves as people who only pursued the guilty.”","908","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"

For Kings County, at least, questionable behavior by key members of its criminal-justice system over at least the past two decades, combined with recent events in other jurisdictions that point to biases deeply embedded in American criminal justice, suggests the urgent need for new methods to guard against structural flaws. So far, Thompson’s C.R.U. has been dedicated to scrutinizing the past. But can he also establish a lasting oversight system to ensure that his own actions, and those of the next D.A., are watched? Thompson admits that there is more to be done, but contends that he cannot divert more resources for those efforts. After the triage period, he says, his unit will begin to address those larger systemic concerns.","909","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"On November 22, 2014, just two days before protesters around the country demonstrated against the decision by a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, not to bring charges against the police officer who killed Michael Brown, a smaller, but similarly focussed protest took place in East New York, Brooklyn. Residents of the Louis H. Pink Houses marched from their homes, carrying candles and signs that read, “NYPD: GUILTY.” The crowd was expressing anger and grief over the fatal shooting of Akai Gurley, twenty-eight and unarmed, by Officer Peter Liang, which took place in the stairwell of Pink Houses, on November 20th.","910","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"Thompson quickly ordered a full investigation of Gurley’s death, which police commissioner William Bratton had called “an unfortunate accident,” and will impanel* a grand jury in Brooklyn to consider criminal charges. “I’m going to do it because it is important to get to the bottom of what happened to Mr. Gurley, who was an innocent, unarmed man who lost his life,” he told reporters.","911","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"
"Gurley’s death may yet be determined to truly have been an accident, but such a ruling, should it come, wouldn’t diminish what the protesters, some of them residents of Pink Houses, already know. For them, Gurley’s name has already been added to the growing list of names that signify the failures of a criminal-justice system that enables the often-fatal mistreatment of black people in America. Outsiders tend, sometimes, to understand such protests as a creak-in-the-joints sense, among oppressed communities, that rain clouds are approaching; protesters in those communities are saying, rather, that they are standing outside, drenched, without an umbrella. Gurley’s death embodies the challenge that Thompson has set for himself: to restore the community’s confidence that the criminal-justice system will protect them.","912","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kenneth-thompson-conviction-review-unit-brooklyn"

"On July 23rd, Donald Trump’s red-white-and-navy-blue Boeing 757 touched down in Laredo, Texas, where the temperature was climbing to a hundred and four degrees. In 1976, the Times introduced Trump, then a little-known builder, to readers as a “publicity shy” wunderkind who “looks ever so much like Robert Redford,” and quoted an admiring observation from the architect Der Scutt: “That Donald, he could sell sand to the Arabs.” Over the years, Trump honed a performer’s ear for the needs of his audience. He starred in “The Apprentice” for fourteen seasons, cultivating a lordly persona and a squint that combined Clint Eastwood on the high plains and Derek Zoolander on the runway. Once he emerged as the early front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, this summer, his airport comings and goings posed a delicate staging issue: a rogue wind off the tarmac could render his comb-over fully erect in front of the campaign paparazzi. So, in Laredo, Trump débuted a protective innovation: a baseball hat adorned with a campaign slogan that he recycled from Ronald Reagan’s 1980 run for the White House—“Make America Great Again!” The headwear, which had the rigid façade and the braided rope of a cruise-ship giveaway, added an expeditionary element to the day’s outfit, of blazer, pale slacks, golf shoes—well suited for a mission that he was describing as one of great personal risk. “I may never see you again, but we’re going to do it,” he told Fox News on the eve of the Texas visit.","914","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When Trump announced his candidacy, on June 16th, he vowed to build a two-thousand-mile-long wall to stop Mexico from “sending people that have lots of problems.” He said, “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Three of the statements had no basis in fact—the crime rate among first-generation immigrants is lower than that for native-born Americans—but Trump takes an expansive view of reality. “I play to people’s fantasies,” he writes in “The Art of the Deal,” his 1987 memoir. “I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective form of promotion.”","915","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s campaign announcement was mocked and condemned—and utterly successful. His favorability among Republicans leaped from sixteen per cent to fifty-seven per cent, a greater spike than that of any other candidate’s début. Immigration became the centerpiece of his campaign. “Donald Trump has changed the entire debate on immigration,” Rush Limbaugh told his listeners last month. As the climax of events in Las Vegas and Phoenix, Trump brought onstage Jamiel Shaw, Sr., whose seventeen-year-old son was killed, in 2008, by a man who was in the country illegally. Trump stood by while Shaw told the crowd how his son was shot.","916","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Before departing for Laredo, Trump said, “I’ve been invited by border patrols, and they want to honor me, actually, thousands and thousands of them, because I’m speaking up.” Though Trump said “border patrols,” the invitation had in fact come from a local branch of the border-patrol union, and the local, after consulting with headquarters, withdrew the invitation a few hours before Trump arrived, on the ground that it would not endorse political candidates. Descending the airplane stairs, Trump looked thrilled to be arriving amid a controversy; he waded into a crowd of reporters and described the change of plans as the handiwork of unspecified enemies. “They invited me, and then, all of a sudden, they were told, silencio! They want silence.” Asked why he felt unsafe in Laredo—which has a lower crime rate than New York City or Washington, D.C.—he invoked another “they”: “Well, they say it’s a great danger, but I have to do it. I love the country. There’s nothing more important than what I’m doing.”","917","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

He disappeared into one of seven S.U.V.s, escorted by a dozen police vehicles—a larger motorcade than Mitt Romney merited as the Republican nominee.

Other Republicans offer “canned bullshit,” Rice went on. “People have got so terribly annoyed and disenchanted and disenfranchised, really, by candidates who get up there, and all their stump speeches promise everything to everyone.” By the night’s end, Rice was sold. “I heard echoes of Ronald Reagan,” he told me, adding, “If I had to vote today, I would vote for Trump.”","938","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Dave Anderson, a New Hampshire Republican who retired from United Parcel Service, told me, “People say, ‘Well, it’d be nice to have another Bush.’ No, it wouldn’t be nice. We had two. They did their duty. That’s fine, but we don’t want this Bush following what his brother did. And he’s not coming across as very strong at all. He’s not saying what Trump is saying.

She worked at a furniture company, she said. “But the industry went down the tubes.” Her husband, Charlie, used to build household electricity meters at a General Electric plant, until the job moved to Mexico. Now he parks cars at a hospital. Trump, in his speech, promised to stop companies from sending jobs abroad, and the Merzes became Trump Republicans. They are churchgoers, but they don’t expect Trump to become one, and they forgive his unpriestly comments about women. “There are so many other things going on in this country that we’ve got be concerned about,” Nancy said. “I’ve seen a lot of our friends lose their houses.”","940","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s fans project onto him a vast range of imaginings—about toughness, business acumen, honesty—from a continuum that ranges from economic and libertarian conservatives to the far-right fringe. In partisan terms, his ideas are riven by contradiction—he calls for mass deportations but opposes cuts to Medicare and Social Security; he vows to expand the military but criticizes free trade—and yet that is a reflection of voters’ often incoherent sets of convictions. The biggest surprise in Trump’s following? He “made an incredible surge among the Tea Party supporters,” according to Patrick Murray, who runs polling for Monmouth University. Before Trump announced his candidacy, only twenty per cent of Tea Partiers had a favorable view of him; a month later, that figure had risen to fifty-six per cent. Trump became the top choice among Tea Party voters, supplanting (and opening a large lead over) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, both Tea Party stalwarts. According to a Washington Post /ABC News poll conducted last month, the “broad majority” of Trump’s supporters hailed from two groups: voters with no college degree, and voters who say that immigrants weaken America. By mid-August, Trump was even closing in on Hillary Clinton. CNN reported that, when voters were asked to choose between the two, Clinton was leading fifty-one per cent to forty-five.","941","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

At the time, I happened to be reporting on extremist white-rights groups, and observed at first hand their reactions to his candidacy. Trump was advancing a dire portrait of immigration that partly overlapped with their own. On June 28th, twelve days after Trump’s announcement, the Daily Stormer, America’s most popular neo-Nazi news site, endorsed him for President: “Trump is willing to say what most Americans think: it’s time to deport these people.” The Daily Stormer urged white men to “vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests.”","943","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Ever since the Tea Party’s peak, in 2010, and its fade, citizens on the American far right—Patriot militias, border vigilantes, white supremacists—have searched for a standard-bearer, and now they’d found him. In the past, “white nationalists,” as they call themselves, had described Trump as a “Jew-lover,” but the new tone of his campaign was a revelation. Richard Spencer is a self-described “identitarian” who lives in Whitefish, Montana, and promotes “white racial consciousness.” At thirty-six, Spencer is trim and preppy, with degrees from the University of Virginia and the University of Chicago. He is the president and director of the National Policy Institute, a think tank, co-founded by William Regnery, a member of the conservative publishing family, that is “dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of European people in the United States and around the world.” The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Spencer “a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old.” Spencer told me that he had expected the Presidential campaign to be an “amusing freak show,” but that Trump was “refreshing.” He went on, “Trump, on a gut level, kind of senses that this is about demographics, ultimately. We’re moving into a new America.” He said, “I don’t think Trump is a white nationalist,” but he did believe that Trump reflected “an unconscious vision that white people have—that their grandchildren might be a hated minority in their own country. I think that scares us. They probably aren’t able to articulate it. I think it’s there. I think that, to a great degree, explains the Trump phenomenon.

"From the beginning of the current race, the conservative establishment has been desperate for Trump to be finished. After he disparaged the war record of Senator John McCain, the New York Post gave him a front-page farewell—“DON VOYAGE”—and a Wall Street Journal editorial declared him a “catastrophe.” But Trump carried on—in part because he had activated segments of the electorate that other candidates could not, or would not. On July 20th, three days before his trip to Texas, Ann Coulter, whose most recent book is “¡Adios, America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole,” appeared on Sean Hannity’s show and urged fellow-Republicans to see Trump’s summer as a harbinger. “The new litmus test for real conservatives is immigration,” she said. “They used to say the same thing about the pro-life Republicans and the pro-gun Republicans, and, ‘Oh, they’re fringe and they’re tacky, and we’re so embarrassed to be associated with them.’ Now every one of them comes along and pretends they’d be Reagan.”","946","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Celebrities had little place in American politics until the 1920 Presidential election, when Al Jolson and other stars from the fledgling film industry endorsed Warren Harding. Two decades ago, Americans were less focussed on paid-for politicians, so Ross Perot, a self-funded billionaire candidate, did not derive the same benefit as Trump from the perception of independence.","947","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"Trump’s admirers hear in his words multiple appeals. Michael Hill heads the Alabama-based League of the South, a secessionist group that envisions an independent Southern republic with an “Anglo-Celtic” leadership. In 1981, Hill began teaching history at Stillman College, a historically black college in Tuscaloosa. He applied for jobs at other schools, and was turned down, which he attributes to affirmative action. In 1994, he co-founded the League, which put him at odds, he said, with “civil-rights-age, older black faculty and administrators, looking down their nose at this uppity white boy coming out here, talking about the Confederate flag and all that kind of stuff.” In 1999, he left Stillman. He told me, “If academia is not for me, because of who I am—a white Southern male, Christian, straight, whatever—then I’m going to find something that is. I’m going to fight this battle for my people.” Hill was moved by Trump’s frequent references to Kathryn Steinle, a thirty-two-year-old woman who, on July 1st, was walking with her father on a pier in San Francisco when she was fatally wounded in what police described as a random shooting. When police arrested Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a repeat felon who had been deported from the United States five times, Trump adopted the story of “that beautiful woman” as “another example of why we must secure our border immediately.” Hill told me, “That struck such a nerve with people, because a lot of this political stuff is abstract, but, as a father, I’ve got a daughter as well, and I could just see myself holding my daughter, and her looking up at me and saying, ‘Help me, Daddy.’ ” Hill, who condemns immigration and interracial marriage and warns of the influence of “Jewry,” said, “I love to see somebody like Donald Trump come along. Not that I believe anything that he says. But he is stirring up chaos in the G.O.P., and for us that is good.”","950","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Short and genial, he wore Top-Siders, khaki shorts, and a polo shirt. As we talked, Griffin’s eyes wandered to his two-year-old son, who was roaming nearby. Griffin told me that he embraced white nationalism after reading Patrick Buchanan’s “Death of the West,” which argued, in Griffin’s words, that “all of the European peoples were dying out, their birthrates were low, and you had mass immigration and multiculturalism.” Griffin once had high hopes for the Tea Party. “They channelled all that rage into electing an impressive number of Republicans in the South, but then all they did was try to cut rich Republicans’ taxes and make life easier for billionaires!” he said. “It was all hijacked, and a classic example of how these right-wing movements emerge, and they’re misdirected into supporting the status quo.”","952","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Soon, he warned, adopting the unspecified “they,” they will come for the “monuments, battlefields, parks, cemeteries, street names, even the dead themselves.” The crowd was on its feet, cheering him on. “This, my friends, is cultural genocide,” he said, adding, “Often, as history has shown, cultural genocide is merely a prelude to physical genocide.” I ducked out to catch a flight to Des Moines: Trump was speaking the next day in Iowa.","954","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Gary Johnson, who as a Republican served two terms as the governor of New Mexico, before becoming the 2012 Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, told me that anyone who runs for office discovers that some portion of the electorate is available to be enraged and manipulated, if a candidate is willing to do it. “I ran across this constantly,” he said. “This eight per cent out there that bangs their fist on the table and says, ‘The biggest problem we’re facing is immigration!’ And I’m going, ‘No! No! This is not the case!’ ” Johnson cited a poll that at that point put Trump’s support among Republicans at eighteen per cent, and told me, “I don’t think there’s an eighteen-per-cent element of this country that is just outright racist. But there is a segment out there that is, and he has definitely appealed to that.” Most people, in Johnson’s view, are animated by other parts of Trump’s pitch—“that he’s going to get in and make the tough deals, and nobody’s going to screw with him, because he’ll drop bombs.” That coalition—the fearful and the frustrated—is powerful. “That’s how you begin to get to eighteen per cent,” Johnson said.","956","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As people turned up in Oskaloosa, I encountered some of the fearful. A construction worker named Ron James, wearing a T-shirt that said “Every-Juan Illegal Go Home,” told me that the “invasion of illegals” is eroding American culture: “We’re getting flushed down the toilet.” But the vast majority of the room, as best I could tell, was more like Stephanie DeVolder, an elegant fiftysomething, with blond hair and bright-green eyes, who had worked as a sales rep for Dice, a job-search site. She was glad that Trump had “brought up the horrific treatment of the veterans,” and that “he is a foremost believer in the military,” and she admired his work on television. “I bought the videos of ‘The Apprentice,’ and watched the whole thing,” she said. “He is a phenomenal judge of character, and he actually does have a heart. He is absolutely amazing.” His fame had guided her to his political views, and, in time, she had concluded that he was “absolutely right about border security.”","957","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Emerging from the wings, in a navy suit, a white shirt, and a pink tie, Trump paused midway across the stage to spread his arms in a gesture of astonished, grateful embrace. For years, Trump has been compared to P. T. Barnum, but the comparison doesn’t capture his range; on the campaign trail, he is less the carnival barker than the full cast—the lion, the fire-eater, the clown with the seltzer—all trussed into a single-breasted Brioni suit. Music from the “Karate Kid” soundtrack blared—“You’re the best around! Nothing’s gonna ever keep you down!”—and, for a moment, Trump looked genuinely startled by the ardor of the stargazers in the crowd. At the lectern, he said, “It’s a terrific place, Iowa.” Then he monologued for an hour, off the cuff, on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server (“What she did is very criminal”); Scott Walker (“Finally, I can attack!”); the Veterans Administration (“the most corrupt group of people in all of Washington”).","958","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As always, he created a powerful set piece about Mexican criminals who are allowed to “roam around, shooting people and killing people,” as he put it. He described this as a hidden scourge: “Such a big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it.” He reminded the crowd of his trip to Laredo: “I told the pilots, I said, ‘Fly a little bit away from the border, please. Fly a little bit inland.’ It’s a whole scary thing.” He said that when he returned to New York his wife had greeted him in tears. “You made it safely from the border!” she cried. As always, he spoke of Kathryn Steinle’s murder—“Kate, beautiful Kate”—and of the death of Jamiel Shaw’s son, “shot by an animal, an animal that shouldn’t have been in this country.” He urged Iowans to be afraid, even if they didn’t see the threat. “When you’re afraid to walk into your own country, it’s pretty bad,” he said. “Hard to believe. You don’t have that problem in Iowa, in all fairness. But it’s pretty rough out there.”","959","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Over the years, Trump has rejected the suggestion that he is a “belligerent, loudmouthed racist,” as Paul Krugman, the Times columnist, put it recently. “I have a great relationship with the blacks,” Trump said on the radio, in 2011.","960","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump has always weaved in and out of racially charged controversies. In 2000, he secretly ran ads opposing a Catskills casino backed by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, because it would rival his businesses in Atlantic City. Beneath a picture of drug paraphernalia, the ad asked, “Are these the new neighbors we want?” Tribal leaders denounced the message as “racist and inflammatory,” and Trump and his associates were fined by New York State for concealing the true source of the ads. In March, 2011, Trump, who was considering a Presidential run, resurrected the crackpot theory that Barack Obama is not an American citizen, declaring, “I want him to show his birth certificate.” (It had already been publicly available for more than three years.) Trump’s declaration gave the issue new prominence. At the time, Trump’s on-again, off-again political adviser, the former Nixon aide Roger Stone, said that the decision to become a birther was “a brilliant base-building move.”","961","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s phantasmagorical visions of marauding immigrants are part of a genre in which immigration and race are intermingled. In recent years, hoaxes and theories that were once confined to the margins have been laundered through mainstream media outlets. In 2013, Fox News repeatedly broadcast warnings about the “knockout game,” based on a self-published book by the white nationalist Colin Flaherty, which described black men randomly attacking white pedestrians. In a study published in the journal Race & Class, Mike King, a sociologist at SUNY-Oneonta, searched for a single actual case of the knockout game and found none. The news reports were largely patched together from unrelated viral videos of street violence. Bureau of Justice statistics show, King wrote, a “marked decrease in random assaults, including black assaults on white strangers.”","962","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When Trump started emphasizing the mortal threat posed by undocumented immigration, America’s white nationalists rejoiced. “Why are whites supposed to be happy about being reduced to a minority?” Jared Taylor, of American Renaissance, asked me. “It’s clear why Hispanics celebrate diversity: ‘More of us!

"Taylor, who calls himself a “racial dissident,” was slim and decorous in gray trousers and a button-down when we met. For years, he and others have sensed an opportunity on the horizon to expand their ranks. When Obama was elected in 2008, Stormfront, the leading white-supremacist Web forum, crashed from heavy traffic. The Klan, weakened by lawsuits and infighting, barely exists anymore, but the Internet draws in young racists like Dylann Roof, who is accused of the June 17th massacre of nine people at a church in Charleston. The attack inspired a broad effort to remove the Confederate flag—from the state capitol and from the shelves of Amazon and of Walmart and a host of other retail stores. Defenders of the flag were galvanized, and they organized more than a hundred rallies around the South, interpreting the moment, months after racial unrest in Ferguson and Baltimore, as a sign of a backlash against political correctness and multiculturalism. Trump’s language landed just as American hate groups were more energized than at any time in years. Griffin, the blogger for the League of the South, told me that the removal of the flag had crystallized “fears that people have about what happens when we become a minority. What happens when we have no control over things? You’re seeing it play out right now.”","964","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Over sandwiches in the dining room of Taylor’s brick Colonial, with views of a spacious back yard, a half-hour from downtown Washington, D.C., five of his readers and friends shared their views on race and politics, on the condition that I not use their full names. They were white men, in white-collar jobs, and each had a story of radicalization: Chris, who wore a pink oxford shirt and a tie, and introduced himself as an employee of “Conservativism, Inc.,” the Republican establishment, said that he had graduated from a public high school where there were frequent shootings, but he felt he was supposed to “ignore the fact that we were not safe on a day-to-day basis because of all of these blacks and the other immigrants in our schools.”","965","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

In a study published in 2011, Michael Norton, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Samuel Sommers, a professor of psychology at Tufts, found that more than half of white Americans believe that whites have replaced blacks as “the primary victims of discrimination” today, even though, as Norton and Sommers write, “by nearly any metric—from employment to police treatment, loan rates to education—statistics continue to indicate drastically poorer outcomes for Black than White Americans.”","966","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"The men around the table, unlike previous generations of white nationalists, were inspired not by nostalgia for slavery but by their dread of a time when non-Hispanic whites will no longer be the largest demographic group in America. They uniformly predicted a violent future. Erick, who wore a Captain America T-shirt and unwittingly invoked one of Trump’s signature phrases, told me, “The American dream is dead, and the American nightmare is just beginning.

"In early August, the Republican candidates convened in Cleveland for their first debate. I watched it on television with Matthew Heimbach, the young white nationalist in Cincinnati, and some of his friends. Heimbach, whom anti-racist activists call “the Little Fuhrer,” for his tirades against “rampant multiculturalism,” founded the Traditionalist Youth Network, a far-right group that caters to high-school and college students and pushes for the separation of blacks and whites. Stocky and bearded, Heimbach is ambitious. He graduated, in 2013, from Towson University, in Maryland, where he attracted controversy for forming a “white student union.” He has met with European Fascists, including members of the Golden Dawn, in Greece.","969","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Heimbach rents part of a house on a placid side street and works as a landscaper. He and his wife recently had their first child, a boy named Nicholas. When I asked Heimbach how he got involved with Fascist politics, he laughed. “I was not raised like this,” he said. “I was raised to be a normal small-town Republican.” The son of teachers in Poolesville, Maryland, an hour from Washington, he, like Brad Griffin, credited Buchanan’s book “Death of the West” for seeding his conception of a desolate future. “Even if you play the game, even if you do everything right, then the future, when it comes to your income, when it comes to benefits, when it comes to everything, we are going to be the first generation in American history to be living worse than our parents.” He went on, “My own parents tell me, ‘Well, you should just shut up, you should go get a normal job, and get a two-car garage, and then you’ll be happy.’ ”","970","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"On the economics, Heimbach’s narrative is not wrong. During a half-century of change in the American labor market—the rise of technology and trade, the decline of manual labor—nobody has been hit harder than low-skilled, poorly educated men. Between 1979 and 2013, pay for men without a college degree fell by twenty-one per cent in real terms; for women with similar credentials, pay rose by three per cent, thanks partly to job opportunities in health care and education. Like many ultraconservatives, Heimbach had largely given up on the Republican Party. He said, “We need to get the white community to actually start speaking for the white community, instead of letting a bunch of Republicans that hate us anyway, and don’t speak for our values, be the unofficial spokespeople.”","971","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"During the debate, Mike Huckabee was asked how he might attract enough support from independents and Democrats to get elected, and Heimbach shouted at the TV, “You don’t need to!

"On a couch across from the television, Tony Hovater, who used to be a drummer in a band and now works as a welder, said that, from what he has heard from Trump, he suspects that Trump shares his fears about immigration but can’t say so openly. Hovater told me, “I think he’s, like, dog-whistling,” adding, “He’s saying we should probably favor more European immigration, or maybe more of just a meritocracy sort of system, but he’s not coming out and saying it, because people will literally stamp him: ‘Oh, you just hate Mexicans.’ ” Hovater hopes that Trump will find a way to be more forthright: “Why not just say it?”","973","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"For his part, Hovater hopes to get into politics. This fall, he’s running for City Council in New Carlisle, Ohio, representing what he and Heimbach have named the Traditional Workers Party. He is taking inspiration from Trump’s populist success. “Just like we’re seeing with Trump, if the people honestly feel like you’re fighting for them, they’ll rally behind you,” he said. He knows that his views are “extreme,” but Trump’s success tells him that people support tone over substance. “People will be, like, ‘Well, I’ll take the fighter, even though I might disagree with him on some things,’ ” he said.","974","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As the debate wound down, Trump, in his final statement, recited his mantra of despair. “Our country is in serious trouble. We don’t win anymore,” he said. “We can’t do anything right.” Matthew Parrott, a Web developer who was sipping coffee from a cup adorned with a swastika, said, “He was sassy without being comical. He struck exactly the tone he needed to give the people supporting him exactly what they want more of.” He went on, “The political system hasn’t been providing an outlet for social-conservative populism. You had this Ron Paul revolution, and all the stuff about cutting taxes, small government, and that’s just not the electrifying issue that they were expecting it to be. Simple folks, they want the border secure. They want what Donald Trump is mirroring at them. I think he’s an intelligent businessman who identified what the people want to hear.

"Trump emerged from the debate on a wrathful tear. When Megyn Kelly, the Fox News host, asked him to explain why he called some women “fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals,” Trump replied, “What I say is what I say.” In an interview the next day, he said that Kelly had “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.” In the attendant uproar, Trump played dumb, declaring that only a “deviant” would think he was referring to menstruation, when he was thinking only of her nose.","976","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"On August 16th, with the media in full summer frenzy, Trump made his first detailed proposal, a six-page immigration plan that outlined an unprecedented crackdown. Presented as the remedy for a victimized nation—“We will not be taken advantage of anymore”—Trump’s plan called for the government to deport large segments of the undocumented population, seize money that these immigrants attempt to send home, and, contravening the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, deny citizenship to their U.S.-born children.","979","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based organization that seeks to reduce immigration (it is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center), hailed Trump’s plan as the “American Workers’ Bill of Rights.” Mark Meckler, the co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, described it as a new standard “that all the other candidates will now have to meet,” and Scott Walker immediately echoed Trump’s call for building a wall and ending birthright citizenship. Other Republicans recoiled, convinced that Trump’s nativist turn would taint the Party’s image as ruinously as Mitt Romney’s “self-deportation” comments in his race against Barack Obama. At the time, Trump himself disapproved of Romney’s approach, saying, in November, 2012, “He had a crazy policy of ‘self- deportation,’ which was maniacal. It sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote. He lost the Asian vote. He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.” Trump now faced the risk that his new stance could eventually undo him.","980","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

The police said that, after the men were arrested, one of them, Scott Leader, justified the assault by saying, “Donald Trump was right—all these illegals need to be deported.” (Both men pleaded not guilty.) When Trump was asked at a press conference about the case, and about threats of other violence, he replied, “I think that would be a shame, but I haven’t heard about that. I will say that people that are following me are very passionate. They love this country, and they want this country to be great again, and they are very passionate, I will say that.” (Two days later, Trump, under fire, tweeted, “Boston incident is terrible. . . .

"When Trump leaped to the head of the Republican field, he delivered the appearance of legitimacy to a moral vision once confined to the fevered fringe, elevating fantasies from the message boards and campgrounds to the center stage of American life. In doing so, he pulled America into a current that is coursing through other Western democracies—Britain, France, Spain, Greece, Scandinavia—where xenophobic, nationalist parties have emerged since the 2008 economic crisis to besiege middle-ground politicians. In country after country, voters beset by inequality and scarcity have reached past the sober promises of the center-left and the center-right to the spectre of a transcendent solution, no matter how cruel. “The more complicated the problem, the simpler the demands become,” Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at the University of California in San Diego, told me. “When people get frustrated and irritated, they want to cut the Gordian knot.”","983","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump has succeeded in unleashing an old gene in American politics—the crude tribalism that Richard Hofstadter named “the paranoid style”—and, over the summer, it replicated like a runaway mutation. Whenever Americans have confronted the reshuffling of status and influence—the Great Migration, the end of Jim Crow, the end of a white majority—we succumb to the anti-democratic politics of absolutism, of a “conflict between absolute good and absolute evil,” in which, Hofstadter wrote, “the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Nothing but complete victory will do.” Trump was born to the part. “I’ll do nearly anything within legal bounds to win,” he wrote, in “The Art of the Deal.” “Sometimes, part of making a deal is denigrating your competition.” Trump, who long ago mastered the behavioral nudges that could herd the public into his casinos and onto his golf courses, looked so playful when he gave out Lindsey Graham’s cell-phone number that it was easy to miss just how malicious a gesture it truly was. It expressed the knowledge that, with a single utterance, he could subject an enemy to that most savage weapon of all: us.","984","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Trump has bequeathed a concoction of celebrity, wealth, and alienation that is more potent than any we’ve seen before.

One son, Donald Trump, took up his father’s example, slathered it in gold leaf and topped it with world-class cubic zirconia, cultivated a head of pumpkiny, multidirectional hair, accumulated billions of dollars (though likely fewer billions than he’s claimed), and, by the eighties, became the P.

He congratulated Alejandro González Iñárritu for winning numerous Oscars for “Birdman” with this gracious remark: “Well, it was a great night for Mexico, as usual in this country.” He once told Bryant Gumbel, in an interview for an NBC program on race, what he thought about affirmative action: “If I was starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I really do believe they have the actual advantage today.” In the seventies, the Trump real-estate company was sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in its rental practices in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Queens. After settling the case with Trump, the Justice Department sued yet again for non-compliance. In 1989, Trump took out an ad in the Daily News, and three other newspapers, about the Central Park jogger rape case, in which he declared that the “criminals of every age” who had been arrested twelve days earlier—five African-American and Hispanic teen-agers—were “crazed misfits,” part of “roving bands.” “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY,” the ad read. “BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” Years after it turned out that someone else had committed the crime, and the young men had finally been released from prison, Trump wrote an unapologetic op-ed for the paper in which he called the city’s push for restitution payments to the men “a disgrace.” He made it plain that, to him, their lives were nothing, and, besides, “These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels.”","989","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"

And yet his remarks, like those of other candidates, were calibrated to assure the public that Trump’s comments were “not reflective of the Republican Party.” As if this had been a misstep, an aberration, and not typical Trump. Some are unwilling to go even that far. Chris Christie distanced himself from Trump’s rant, too, but he was quick to add, “I like Donald. He’s a good guy.”","994","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Christie is not alone in his affection. Recently, on “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart gave Bill Clinton plenty of room to tee off on Trump. Clinton declined. Trump, he said, with a wily smile, “has been, believe it or not, uncommonly nice to Hillary and me.” Perhaps. Not long ago, on MSNBC, Trump said that Clinton was “probably” the best of the four most recent Presidents. Then he added, “Frankly, had he not met Monica, had he not met Paula, had he not met various and sundry semi-beautiful women, he would have had a much better deal going.” That “sundry semi-beautiful” bit was an especially, even uncommonly, nice Trumpism. Hillary Clinton, for her part, could not bring herself to do anything more than tap Trump on the wrist. She told CNN that she was “very disappointed” in Trump’s remarks about Mexican immigrants—which, considering the fact that the Clintons attended one of Trump’s weddings, seems quite polite. But very disappointing.","995","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"It’s a wonder, though, that Kristol is so concerned. In large measure, when it comes to issues like marriage equality and Obamacare, the Republicans have come through with Spenglerian stir-the-base rhetoric. After the announcement of the Supreme Court decision on marriage equality, Ted Cruz declared, “Today is some of the darkest twenty-four hours in our nation’s history.” Rick Santorum said that the Court’s decision “put the nail in the coffin” of the institution of marriage itself. “The climate is changing,” the milder Jeb Bush has allowed, but adds, against nearly absolute scientific consensus, “whether men are doing it or not.”","996","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"History is replete with joke candidates for high office. Will Rogers ran for President, in 1928, as the standard-bearer of the Anti-Bunk Party, and wrote a book about his experience: “He Chews to Run.” One Yetta Bronstein, an (imaginary) citizen of the Bronx and the creation of a hoax artist named Alan Abel, was on Presidential campaign posters, in 1964 and 1968, promoting fluoridation, sex education, and, oddly, bingo. (“Vote for Yetta and watch things get better.”) At the 1968 Democratic Convention, in Chicago, the Yippies put forward their candidate: Pigasus. And, for a brief time in 2007, Stephen Colbert entered the race, promising “truthiness” for all.","997","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Donald Trump is a joke, too, but of a different sort. His intention is not to inspire laughter or relief; his targets are not the powerful. He doesn’t punch up. He spews forth ugliness everywhere he goes. It would be nice, and maybe wise, simply to ignore him, in the hope that he will, after all these many years, just go away. But he never really does, and the most immediate concern is not that he will win the office he pursues but that he will get in the heads of the candidates around him. Trump’s father was a self-promoter who dispersed discounts in his balloons. The son offers only toxic gas.","998","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Donald Trump’s campaign slogan is “Make America Great Again!” A better one might be “Only in America.” You could not ask for a better illustration of the complexity of ordinary Americans’ attitudes toward class, wealth, and social identity than the fact that a billionaire’s popularity among working-class voters has given him the lead in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination. In a recent Washington Post/ABC poll, Trump was the candidate of choice of a full third of white Republicans with no college education. Working-class voters face stagnant wages and diminished job prospects, and a 2014 poll found that seventy-four per cent of them think “the U.S. economic system generally favors the wealthy.” Why on earth would they support a billionaire?","999","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Part of the answer is Trump’s nativist and populist rhetoric. But his wealth is giving him a boost, too. The Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg, who’s published reams of work on white working-class attitudes, told me, “There is no bigger problem for these voters than the corruption of the political system. They think big companies are buying influence, while average people are blocked out.” Trump’s riches allow him to portray himself as someone who can’t be bought, and his competitors as slaves to their donors. (Ross Perot pioneered this tactic during the 1992 campaign.) “I don’t give a shit about lobbyists,” Trump proclaimed at an event in May. And his willingness to talk about issues that other candidates are shying away from, like immigration and trade, reinforces the message that money makes him free.","1000","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Trump has also succeeded in presenting himself as a self-made man, who has flourished thanks to deal-making savvy. In fact, Trump was born into money, and his first great real-estate success—the transformation of New York’s Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt—was enabled by a tax abatement worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet many voters see Trump as someone who embodies the American dream of making your own fortune. And that dream remains surprisingly potent: in a 2011 Pew survey, hard work and personal drive (not luck or family connections) were the factors respondents cited most frequently to explain why people got ahead. Even Trump’s unabashed revelling in his wealth works to his benefit, since it makes him seem like an ordinary guy who can’t get over how cool it is to be rich.","1001","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"For someone who talks a lot about winning, Trump has a résumé dotted with more than a few losses. On four occasions, companies he’s been involved with have gone bankrupt. Yet these failures haven’t dented his reputation at all, contributing instead to a sense that he’s had to deal with adversity. In other countries, such failures would make it very hard for him to campaign as a visionary businessman. But the U.S. has always been exceptionally tolerant, in terms of both attitude and the law, toward business failure and bankruptcy. Indeed, Trump brags about how he used the bankruptcy code to get better deals for his companies; as he put it not long ago, “I’ve used the laws of the country to my advantage.”","1002","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Trump is hardly the first Western plutocrat to venture into politics. Think of William Randolph Hearst or, more recently, Silvio Berlusconi. But both Hearst and Berlusconi benefitted from controlling media empires. Trump has earned publicity all on his own, by playing the role of that quintessential American figure the huckster. As others have observed, the businessman he most resembles is P. T. Barnum, whose success rested on what he called “humbug,” defined as “putting on glittering appearances . . . by which to suddenly arrest public attention, and attract the public eye and ear.” Barnum’s key insight into how to arrest public attention was that, to some degree, Americans enjoy brazen exaggeration. No American businessman since Barnum has been a better master of humbug than Trump has.","1003","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Take the debate over how much Trump is worth. It’s impossible to get a definitive accounting of his wealth, since almost all of it is in assets—mainly real estate—that don’t have clear market values. Still, he’s clearly enormously rich. Bloomberg estimates his wealth at $2.9 billion, while Forbes pegs it at $4.1 billion—both tidy sums. But Trump will have none of that: thanks to the value of his brand, he says, he’s worth at least a cool ten billion. This number seems so absurdly over the top as to be self-defeating. But there is a kind of genius in the absurdity. Trump understands that only an outrageous number can really “attract the public eye and ear.”","1004","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"
"Trump’s lack of interest in policy and his inflammatory rhetoric make it easy to dismiss him as a serious candidate, and it’s highly improbable that he could ultimately win the nomination. But his bizarre blend of populist message and glitzy ways has allowed him to connect with precisely the voters that any Republican candidate needs in order to get elected (including many whom Romney couldn’t reach). As Greenberg says, as long as he’s in the race, “Trump is a huge problem for the Party. He’s appealing to a very important part of the base, and bringing out the issues the other candidates don’t want to be talking about.” Republicans may be praying that his campaign is just a joke, but right now Trump is the only one laughing. ♦","1005","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/donald-trumps-sales-pitch"

Among other subjects, he spoke about his big lead in the polls and joked about holding the 2016 election early. “I’d like to have the election tomorrow,” Trump said. “I don’t want to wait.” In another sign of the progress he is making, one of Alabama’s two Republican senators, Jeff Sessions, greeted Trump onstage and praised his tough stance on immigration.","August 22, 2015","1006","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"To say that Trump is flying high would be an understatement. Not only is he crushing his Republican opponents in the polls, many of his critics in the media have thrown in the towel. Having dismissed his candidacy, poked fun at him, and portrayed him (with every justification) as a draft-dodging, racist, sexist huckster, the campaign press is now paying him the ultimate compliment and taking him seriously.","1007","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"On the day of the rally, USA Today reported, with no evident irony, that Trump and his allies were plotting “a path to victory” in the G.O.P. primaries. The Washington Post said that Trump’s Republican rivals were being forced to adopt new strategies to ride out the “Trump tornado.” And a front-page story in the Boston Globe quoted Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, who said, “What is happening with Trump is not a fluke. Yes, he is a great entertainer, but he is able to take advantage of a number of dynamics in American politics as they exist right now. This is an important moment.”","1008","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"We shall see. Perhaps Skocpol is right, and Trump’s rise in the polls represents a deep and lasting political phenomenon. Perhaps, as I suggested a couple of weeks ago, it will wither away, like the candidacies of previous G.O.P. candidates who tickled the party’s base at roughly this stage of the campaign, such as Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. In any case, setting aside Trump’s ultimate fate, his current position demands explanation. How is he doing it? Here are five vaguely plausible theories that I have seen put forward recently.","1009","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"1. He’s a rich celebrity. “Trump is the personification of a 21st-century America fascinated by the super rich and obsessed with celebrity,” James Pindell wrote in the Globe’s Friday story, citing interviews that he’d conducted with a number of historians. It’s not just that Trump’s ceaseless self-promotion and his role on “The Apprentice” have created a level of name recognition that his rivals can’t hope to match. With his status as a bona-fide celebrity, he can get his message out without having to worry about how it is intermediated by the political press, or about whether he is winning the “invisible primary” for the support of moneyed élites. Indeed, rather than being tested by the media, Trump is exploiting it mercilessly, especially the broadcast media.","1010","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Virtually everywhere you look on cable television there is an “exclusive” Trump interview. Since he draws much higher ratings than any other candidate, he knows the cable networks will keep inviting him on and giving him lengthy prime-time interviews, regardless of what he actually says. (This, surely, was the message of the Megyn Kelly dust-up.) The other candidates are forced to rely on occasional onscreen appearances (the debates, especially) and paid media (that is, advertising)—if they can afford it. The celebrity gulf puts them at an enormous disadvantage, which, for now at least, they are failing to surmount.","1011","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"2. He can’t be bought. As the political success of Michael Bloomberg showed, the idea of a billionaire candidate who doesn’t need to kowtow to vested interests can have considerable appeal to American voters. Trump is a populist version of Bloomberg, and he has no compunctions about pointing out how beholden his opponents are to rich donors—who are largely guys like him. During the first televised G.O.P. debate, he was eager to say that he had contributed to the past campaigns of many of his rivals in the full expectation of receiving something in return. He also claimed, effectively, to have paid Hillary Clinton to appear at his wedding. This wasn’t just boasting: it was exploiting his unique position to the maximum.","1012","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Given the widespread belief among voters that most politicians have been hopelessly corrupted by the demands of fund-raising, Trump’s appeal isn’t necessarily confined to ultra-conservatives. Appearing on the Fox Business Network recently, Ralph Nader, the longtime crusader against money in politics, who has mounted two Presidential campaigns as an independent and two as the Green Party nominee, called Trump “a breath of fresh air.” “The two-party tyranny that blocks voter choices and dominates the political scene on behalf of big business needs to be broken up and Trump is the one to do it. It takes a billionaire,” he said. When even someone with Nader’s progressive credentials is making this argument, is it any wonder many other Americans find it attractive?","1013","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"3. G.O.P. voters like his policies. When Trump accuses the Mexican government of sending its criminals to the United States and talks about deporting millions of undocumented workers en masse, many commentators, myself included, see him as engaging in misleading, impractical rabble-rousing. But, as I pointed out earlier this week, the demagoguery is working. Trump isn’t merely matching the more conservative Republican candidates on the immigration issue: he’s beating them. In arecent CNN poll, forty-four per cent of likely Republican voters picked Trump as the candidate who could best handle illegal immigration. (Jeb Bush came in second, with just twelve per cent.)","1014","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"And immigration isn’t the sole issue on which Trump’s views are striking a chord. His tough-on-trade rhetoric resonates with G.O.P. voters, particularly middle-income and low-income white men. Indeed, a recent survey by Pew Research suggested that Republicans, as a group, are now more skeptical of trade agreements, such as the new Trans-Pacific Partnership, than the Democrats are. As Newsweek’s Matt Cooper pointed out in a prescient piece back in June, Trump largely has this issue to himself. Dependent as they are on corporate money, most Republican candidates—from Jeb Bush to Marco Rubio to Scott Walker to Ted Cruz—support trade agreements. Trump, by contrast, is free to take a populist line, which he is doing with great enthusiasm.","1015","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"4. He’s the rider on a white horse. On the radio a while back, I heard Pat Buchanan, who ran for President as a conservative insurgent twice in the nineteen-nineties, and again in 2000, compare Trump to Huey Long, the legendary Louisiana populist who assailed the rich, the corporations, and the metropolitan élites during the twenties and thirties. Like Long, Trump could speak to ordinary folk in a language that they could understand and relate to, Buchanan said. Long was a Democrat, of course, who espoused some policies—such as expanded public services, stricter regulation of business, and higher taxes on the rich—that Trump, in his current incarnation, might well dismiss as socialism. But there still might be something to the comparison. Long “spoke so directly to the people, and that is Donald Trump’s appeal,” Richard D. White, the author of “Kingfish: The Reign of Huey P. Long,” told the Boston Globe. “It is a purely personal relationship with his listeners. It is not based on factual issues.”","1016","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Of course, the divide between populism and demagoguery is often in the eye of the beholder. White, who is now the dean of E.J. Ourso College of Business, at Louisiana State University, highlighted Trump and Long’s penchants for dressing in fancy suits and using incendiary language toward minorities. “The oversimplification of issues is very dangerous, and when you combine that with negativity and fear, the combination is classic populism,” he said. At least one Republican, Frank Luntz, the pollster and strategist, has also suggested that Trump’s candidacy could be dangerous. “There’s something happening out there that is profound, but you gotta be careful; when you tap into it you better have a way to direct it,” Luntz told Politico. “Trump has tapped into it. Bernie Sanders has tapped into it and they’re doing well, but you’re tapping into fire—that’s how hot the anger is. We are in a dangerous political environment that requires a higher standard for the candidates running. It requires them not just to stoke the anger, it’s already there. It requires them to provide the balm of solutions.”","1017","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"5. He’s just a summer diversion. Asked about Trump’s performance in the televised debate and his subsequent comments about Megyn Kelly, Hillary Clinton said, “It’s all entertainment. I think he’s having the time of his life, being up on that stage, saying whatever he wants to say.” Despite Trump’s comments about why she attended his wedding, Clinton is doubtless enjoying the sight of him toying with his Republican rivals, one of whom she may well end up running against. But she also raised a serious point. These days, Presidential campaigns are ludicrously long and bloated. Is there anyone, faced with the prospect of another year and a half of focus-group-tested politicking, who wasn’t secretly (or not so secretly) a bit relieved that Trump entered the fray and provided a diversion?","1018","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"In a column published on the Cook Political Report earlier this week, Amy Walter compared the G.O.P. electorate’s embrace of Trump to a post-college summer fling. “The summer before a presidential election year is a lot like dating in your early 20s. You are unattached and care-free. You want to connect with someone passionately and fall hopelessly in love,” she wrote. “Meanwhile, your parents want you to meet a guy like Jeb Bush.” No wonder G.O.P. voters are dallying with Trump, Walters added. He’s “everything your parents hate. He’s loud. He’s disrespectful. He probably smokes and drives a motorcycle. But, you don’t care.” Eventually, though, you settle down with the responsible guy.","1019","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Which explanation is the most persuasive? Obviously, there is a bit of truth in all of them. I still tend to think his appeal will fade, but it could take a while. In the meantime, Hillary Clinton is right about him enjoying himself. “It’s been wild,” he told the crowd in Mobile, adding, “The reason I am leading is because I know the game. . . . You people are looking for somebody who knows what he is doing.”","1020","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"

"Two months ago, in the first speech of his Presidential campaign, Donald Trump departed from his prepared text in order to speak—vehemently and apparently extemporaneously—about the issues that concerned him most. One of the first was immigration, and he suggested, somewhat paradoxically, that unauthorized immigrants from Mexico were out-competing American workers (“They are beating us, economically”) and also undermining American society. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems,” he added, and then he provided a taxonomy: “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists—and some, I assume, are good people.”","August 19, 2015","1037","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"Some observers thought that the speech was a political disaster, especially because of that one extraordinarily inflammatory word: “rapists.” But it’s clear, in retrospect, that this speech marked the beginning of the Trump surge. The speech inspired weeks of coverage, making Trump—who was unapologetic—the biggest story in political media. A few weeks after the speech, NBC announced that, “due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants,” it would no longer broadcast his Miss U.S.A. or Miss Universe pageants, and he would no longer appear on “The Apprentice,” the long-running reality show. It is possible that, by disrupting Trump’s television career, NBC only made him more motivated to succeed in politics. Less than a month after his launch speech, a poll put Trump, for the first time, atop the Republican heap. It is likely that, by using the R-word, Trump helped establish himself as the only Republican candidate eager to speak his mind on an issue that most of the field would prefer to avoid: immigration.","1038","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"This past weekend, Trump released his first detailed policy statement, on the topic that made him a front-runner; it is called “Immigration Reform that Will Make America Great Again.” He called for more immigration officers, tougher penalties for visitors who overstay their visas, a “pause” in the issuing of new green cards, the end of “birthright citizenship,” and the construction of a “permanent border wall”—to be paid for, he said, by Mexico. This last proposal drew plenty of scorn, since it is hard to imagine how the Mexican government might be induced to spend billions of dollars on a barrier at the behest of U.S. politicians. (Trump suggested that, in the face of Mexican recalcitrance, the U.S. could “impound” remittances from unauthorized workers and charge higher fees to visitors from Mexico.) But some Trump skeptics seemed pleasantly surprised. The editors of National Review, who had previously accused Trump of “intellectual failure” for his unclear statements on immigration, offered qualified praise for the new plan. “It is sensible in its basic outline,” they wrote, “and better in many respects than the ideas presented by his rivals.”","1039","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"

On the matter of birthright citizenship, O’Reilly said that Trump’s plan to abolish it would be foiled by the Fourteenth Amendment, which says, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” Trump, needless to say, was unperturbed. “Many lawyers are saying that’s not the way it is,” he replied—referring, perhaps, to advocates and scholars who argue that the Fourteenth Amendment has been widely misinterpreted.","1040","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"Earlier this summer, it seemed that Trump’s presence in the race could actually make it easier for the other Republican candidates to avoid talking about immigration. They could merely affirm that Trump’s comments about “rapists” were “extraordinarily ugly” or “offensive and inaccurate,” repudiating him without making any specific commitments of their own. Trump’s new proposal may compel them to have the kind of policy discussion that Presidential campaigns are, in general, designed to avoid.","1041","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"In early June, Pew published a new poll chronicling the country’s mixed feelings about immigration. Among other things, the poll provided yet more proof that, when it comes to immigration, Republican politicians are often out of step with Republican voters. When asked to choose between two assertions about the impact of immigration on the U.S., sixty-three per cent of Republicans agreed that immigrants “burden” the country by taking jobs, housing, and health care; only twenty-seven per cent agreed that they “strengthen” the country “through hard work & talents.” But the Republican majority was in the national minority: over all, respondents chose “strengthen” over “burden,” by a margin of fifty-one to forty-one. The numbers explain why, especially in general elections, Republican candidates like Mitt Romney and John McCain have taken pains to emphasize America’s hospitability to immigrants. But the numbers also help account for the frustration among Republican voters who have noticed that, when it comes to immigration, their own party is ignoring them.","1042","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"At the same time, the Pew poll captured a broader ambivalence about immigration. Although Democrats said that they wanted unauthorized immigrants to be able to remain in the country, only forty-eight per cent said that they should be able to apply for citizenship; only twenty-four per cent said that legal immigration should be increased. Meanwhile, a majority of Republicans agreed that granting legal status to unauthorized immigrants was “like a reward for doing something wrong”—and yet a majority of Republicans, even conservative Republicans, said that unauthorized immigrants should nevertheless be “allowed to stay legally.”","1043","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"It is hard to have a consistent position on U.S. immigration laws, partly because the laws themselves seem so inconsistent, and inconsistently enforced: an immigrant who evades armed guards at the border might subsequently arrive in a so-called sanctuary city, in which the federal statutes seem not to apply. Immigrants rearranging—and sometimes risking—their lives must take into account not only the laws that currently exist but also the ways in which those laws will or will not change in coming decades. One of Trump’s simplest and boldest ideas is to end birthright citizenship, the constitutional doctrine under which anyone born inside the U.S. is considered a citizen of it. (Immigration-restriction advocates argue that birthright citizenship incentivizes unauthorized immigration.) Automatic birthright citizenship is widespread in the Americas, but not beyond them; European and Asian countries have more restrictive rules. In other words, birthright citizenship is both an American tradition and a global anomaly, which means that ending it could seem either radical or common-sensical, depending on one’s perspective and objectives.","1044","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"
"Already, Trump’s call for an end to birthright citizenship has brought some clarity to the Republican conversation on immigration. Scott Walker, who used to support a comprehensive reform that would allow unauthorized immigrants to remain in the country, told Fox News in March, “My view has changed.” In an interview with Breitbart last week, he talked about the need to “secure the border,” but offered few details. It wasn’t until earlier this week, when a reporter asked him about Trump’s proposal, that Walker seemed to say, apparently for the first time, that the U.S. should “absolutely” end birthright citizenship. Meanwhile, Marco Rubio said he was “open to doing things that prevent people who deliberately come to the U.S. for the purposes of taking advantage” of birthright citizenship, but said that Trump’s proposal to eliminate the doctrine was “really not a workable plan.” And Jeb Bush said, “We ought to fix the problem, rather than take away rights that are constitutionally endowed.”","1045","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-serious-immigration-debate-thanks-to-donald-trump"

But with the release of his plan, he seems to have started something even more engrossing: a substantive political debate.

Nobody should underestimate Trump’s ability to manipulate the media, or his willingness to do or say anything to further his goals and draw attention to himself. In racing to the head of the G.O.P. polls, he has displayed these talents to the fullest. Underneath it all, though, he’s the same carnival barker that New Yorkers have had to put up with for decades: an aptly named tub of hot air, whose noisy and odiferous utterances rarely withstand serious scrutiny.

For a consumer brand attached to condominiums, golf courses, and reality-TV shows, having a well-earned reputation for exaggerating isn’t necessarily a big problem. The name Trump denotes ostentatiousness: overselling the product is almost part of the appeal.

"A Presidential candidacy is different. After the first burst of publicity, it turns into a fraught, extended exercise in withstanding attacks and critical examinations. This has never been Trump’s forte. When challenged in the past, he has often resorted to sliming his critics or stomping off. In his off-color comments about Rick Perry and John McCain, we have already seen the first of these tactics being repeated.

"The Daily Beast story was the latest indication of what lies ahead. For weeks after Trump entered the race, cable networks treated him as a novelty candidate (and a ratings boost from the gods), according him practically unlimited airtime to say whatever he wanted. Now, finally, some broadcast journalists are starting to ask Trump awkward questions. This weekend, for example, CNN’s Jake Tapper pressed him on how he would deal with illegal immigrants—an issue he has placed front and center in his campaign.","1052","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"As Rob Garver, of the Fiscal Times, pointed out in a brutal post, Trump’s responses amounted to “a sort of immigration-related word salad.” “We have some really bad dudes right here in this country and we’re getting them out. We’re sending them back where they came from,” Trump said, then went on, “The bad ones are going to get out. Then, from that point on, we’re going to look very, very strongly at what we do. And I’m going to formulate a plan that I think people are going to be happy with.”","1053","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"Tapper tried repeatedly to elicit some details, pressing Trump, for instance, on the millions of undocumented immigrants without criminal records who would remain. All he got back was verbiage. “We’re going to see what we’re going to see,” Trump said. He added, “We’re going to take the high ground: we’re going to do what’s right.

"So it is, and that’s one reason why Trump’s rivals for the Republican nomination have struggled to compete with his inflammatory statements. Even in today’s G.O.P., though, rabble-rousing takes you only so far. As time goes on, he will face more questions about his evasions and exaggerations, and the vacuity of his rhetoric will be increasingly difficult to ignore.","1055","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"To take another example, we have Trump’s claim, two weeks ago, that he is worth more than ten billion dollars. In my experience dealing with his more outlandish estimates of his own wealth, a useful, if not entirely reliable, rule of thumb is to move the decimal point one place to the left. That would place his net worth at about a billion dollars, which is actually pretty close to the $1.15 billion figure cited as his minimum net worth in an analysis, by Tim Mullaney of CNBC, of a financial-disclosure form released by the Federal Election Commission last week. (Because most of Trump’s companies are private, any net-worth figure is only an estimate. Forbes reckons he is worth about four billion dollars; Bloomberg says around three billion.)","1056","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"CNBC also questioned the valuation of Trump’s golf businesses at between five hundred and fifty million dollars and more than six hundred seventy-five million dollars. When Mullaney took a closer look, he found that Trump was valuing his golf courses, some of which are well known, at somewhere between two and four times the revenue they generate, whereas most people in the golf industry use a multiplier of one to one and a half times a course’s revenue. “Stacking it up against the universe of other golf-course sales, he is kind of off the charts,” Buddie Johnson, an Arizona-based course developer who wrote a book about valuing golf courses, told Mullaney. “Anyone can say anything. … Such is his verbosity that, when he talks about the valuation of his golf clubs, he talks louder than anyone else, and he thinks that makes it true.”","1057","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-troubles-are-just-beginning"
"Mullaney’s story didn’t garner a great deal of attention, but it displayed the sort of scrutiny that Trump hates. Back in 2005, Timothy L. O’Brien, a former Times reporter who is now the publisher of Bloomberg View, wrote a book about Trump in which he cited reports estimating his net worth at well under a billion dollars. Months later, Trump sued O’Brien—for five billion dollars. (The case was dismissed.

"Measured against the probability of, say, the Chicago Cubs winning the Super Bowl, the Presidential campaign of Donald John Trump, real-estate baron, clothier, and firer of faux employees, has a degree of plausibility. Considered by more conventional measures—and recent polling data notwithstanding—Trump stands almost no chance of gaining the Republican nomination, or ascending to the Presidency if he did. His is a campaign of vanity, of the sort that suggests an inversion of Sherman’s dictum: if he campaigns he shall not be nominated, if nominated he shall not win. This does not mean that his campaign is without significance. Trump has attacked a number of targets in his embryonic candidacy—China, Mexican immigrants, Hillary Clinton—but his most personal grudge appears to be against euphemism. He does not bother to sheath his protectionist urges in pablum about competitiveness, preferring prosecutorial accusation of trade infringement. His gaseous bigotry toward Mexicans who cross the border illegally traffics in unrefined stereotypes, not the language of “fairness” to those immigrants who wait their turn. In launching his campaign he openly stated the underlying rationale of his candidacy: “I’m rich.”","July 11, 2015","1062","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-is-a-rapper"
"This marks a difference between Trump and his fellow member of the fractional one per cent, Mitt Romney. To the extent that Romney’s money came up it was either feebly deployed by his critics as evidence that he was “out of touch” with the concerns of the average recession-era American or, by his supporters, as an indicator of his business acumen and capacity to fix the economy. By comparison, Trump’s money is presented as wealth qua wealth; it abides by him like one of his handlers, ever present, just beyond the camera’s eye, eternally ready to do his bidding. This kind of ostentation looks gauche to Americans who’ve been financially secure long enough to be embarrassed by it, but it also underscores an elemental fact about the billionaire upstart: in all the ways that matter, save actual performing, Donald Trump is a not a politician—he’s a rapper.

"Consider the argument: Donald Trump was gifted with a surname that already sounds like a rapper’s nom de microphone (though the savvy street poet would amend it to something like Trump the Don, so as to conflate the first name with a mafia honorific.) He is the only person in the 2016 Republican field to have appeared both in a commercial endorsing the Wu Tang Clan and the Russell Simmons episode of “Behind the Music.” Trump’s combativeness and overt egomania may induce cringes in the G.O.P. establishment, but this is precisely the behavior we expect—nay, demand—from hip-hop artists. Ditto his tendency to accessorize with beautiful women, a habit that surely motivated his purchase of the Miss Universe pageant. This was not simply a means of burnishing his public appeal by proximity to beauty but also a brilliant means of monetizing male insecurity in a way that has long been painfully apparent within hip-hop culture. Moreover, he’s the only Presidential aspirant with his own clothing line, an atypical venture among real-estate magnates but a virtual requisite for the brand-conscious music impresario—Jay-Z, Diddy, Russell Simmons—looking to diversify his revenue and tastemaking opportunities.

"Hip-hop has been a leading force in what might be called the un-ironic American self-homage. Taken in sum, those dynamics explain why, in the years before he lapsed into birtherism (and found himself lanced—in hip-hop parlance, ethered—by President Obama at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner), Trump, despite his leaden bigotry and general aura of buffoonishness, enjoyed a certain cachet among what might be thought of as a hip-hop demographic. (This was itself notable given that, in 1989, he’d taken out a full-page ad demanding that New York State reinstate the death penalty for the five teenagers charged in the infamous Central Park Five rape case. They were later found to have been wrongfully convicted.) He associated with Diddy and Mike Tyson. His public performance of gleeful affluence seemed to confirm that Trump, despite being born wealthy, embraced the nouveau-riche dictum that there was no point to having money if you had to then be subtle about it. His enduring presence as a figure of public interest is directly tied to the way he offers an aspirational identity that appeals, in particular, to working-class men. (His three million Twitter followers are almost certainly not drawn to him as a standard-bearer of trademark enforcement.) How different is his brand of aspirational identity politics from the story of the Republican Party in the past forty years? His unleavened xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments are controversial but not substantially different from what we’ve heard from various elements of the Tea Party in the past six years.","1066","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-is-a-rapper"

And he lacks the minimal self-awareness required of the country’s chief executive. After making comments about dangerous Mexicans, he told NBC News, “I’ll tell you something, if I get the nomination, I’ll win the Latino vote.” Trump weirdly tends to preface references to ethnic categories with an article, e.g. his statement in 2011 that he has “a great relationship with the blacks.” This sounds like a quibble until you reflect upon the way placing an article before an ethnicity tends to be part of the setup for a statement that is cluelessly offensive.

(Brady has said that destroying old phones is simply part of his normal upgrade m.o., in this instance from a Samsung to an iPhone 6, not evidence of some kind of cover-up scheme.)

But whereas a similar lack of knowledge disqualifies him from being taken seriously on subjects like immigration or taxation, on Deflategate, his passionately intense ignorance is a perfect fit.

Deflategate is less a conventional scandal—with a narrative leading from crime to cover-up to revelation—than a swirling, interminable, self-sustaining opinion storm in which the actual truth, not revealing itself in a timely manner, becomes largely beside the point.

"The N.F.L. doesn’t know. The report of that months-long investigation, conducted by the attorney Ted Wells, concluded that it was more probable than not that a pair of Patriots employees, John Jastremski and Jim McNally, conspired to let air out of the footballs before the start of the Patriots’ playoff game against the Colts, in January; that McNally, who identified himself in a text message with Jastremski as “the deflator,” had likely done the deflating in a private bathroom before taking the balls to the field; and that it was likely that Tom Brady, who had a flurry of conversations and text exchanges with Jastremski after news of the scandal broke, at least knew about the plan. The report did not specify exactly how McNally let the air out, nor did it produce any specific instruction from either Jastremski or Brady for him to do it. Did the Patriots tamper with the footballs? Did Brady know about it? The Wells report believed so, and, based on that report, the N.F.L. fined the Patriots, stripped the team of two draft picks, and suspended Brady for the first four games of the 2015 season.","1071","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-and-deflategate-were-made-for-each-other"

Brady’s own testimony, according to Goodell, was not credible, and the missing phone was proof that he had something to hide. Yet this new morsel, as headline-grabbing as it was, didn’t get us any closer to knowing the central facts about the footballs, which, in as much as any of this matters at all, is the whole point.","1072","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-and-deflategate-were-made-for-each-other"

The Patriots owner, Robert Kraft, sounded equally frustrated and bewildered by Goodell’s decision, saying, at a press conference on Wednesday, “For reasons that I cannot comprehend, there are those in the league office who are more determined to prove that they were right rather than admit any culpability of their own or take any responsibility for the initiation of a process and ensuing investigation that was flawed.” Kraft also argued that “the league still has no hard evidence of anybody doing anything to tamper with the P.S.I. levels of footballs.”","1073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-and-deflategate-were-made-for-each-other"

In the digital present, we’ve come to expect that cover-ups don’t last, that the truth will out, usually sooner rather than later. The Wells investigation was supposed to have found a so-called “smoking gun.” Roger Goodell, in drawing out the punishment process and negotiating with Brady’s lawyers for a reduced suspension, was supposed to have leaned on Brady hard enough to get him to confess or issue an apology. Or else Goodell himself was supposed to have capitulated by now, admitting that the league didn’t have enough hard evidence to punish Brady. John Jastremski and Jim McNally were supposed to have called in to Boston sports radio and spilled the beans. Instead, Deflategate seems to be dwindling in its last act. Opinions on the case, hitting each other back and forth in every Web venue that hosts them, are expressions more of faith—the Patriots are evil, Roger Goodell is inept, Tom Brady is a hero—than of reason.

A Bloomberg poll showed Trump with twenty-one per cent, Bush with ten per cent, and Walker with eight per cent.","1078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Going back to last week, seven polls in a row have shown Trump well out in front. As of lunchtime on Tuesday, the Real Clear Politics poll average, which combines all of the recent surveys, showed him with 23.2 per cent of the Republican vote, Bush with 12.8 per cent, and Walker with 10.6 per cent. Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson were tied for fourth place, at 6.7 per cent.","1079","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"These numbers raise the question of just how enduring Trump’s support will be. Last week, I suggested that the vacuity of his message would ultimately catch up with him, a position that I am sticking with. But he’s undoubtedly the phenomenon of the moment, and it’s worth taking a closer look at the polling data to see where his support comes from, and where it’s likely to go.","1080","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"I’ll start with the new Monmouth University poll numbers, which suggest that Trump is drawing support from across the Republican spectrum. While some of his pitch, such as his comments critical of Mexican immigrants, appears designed to curry favor with Tea Party supporters and other right-wing ultras, he’s also saying something, or doing something, that appeals to Republicans who don’t think of themselves as staunch conservatives.","1081","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Among Republicans who self-identify as “very conservative,” he’s leading his closest challenger, Walker, by twenty-seven per cent to sixteen per cent—an eleven-point gap. Among “somewhat conservative” G.O.P. supporters, he is leading Bush by twenty-two per cent to fourteen per cent—an eight-per-cent gap. And, among “moderate to liberal” Republicans, he is ahead of Bush by twenty-eight per cent to twenty per cent—also, an eight-per-cent lead.","1082","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Trump’s appeal also extends across most major demographic groups, the Monmouth poll found. Among Republican voters aged fifty and up, he is leading Bush by eleven percentage points and Walker by fourteen points. Among G.O.P. voters under fifty, his lead is even bigger: sixteen percentage points over Bush and seventeen points over Walker. As might have been expected, he has a big lead among Republican men: about twenty percentage points. But he’s also picking up considerable support among Republican women: twenty per cent said that they supported him, compared to twelve per cent for Walker and eleven per cent for Bush.","1083","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Numbers like these make it difficult to pigeonhole Trump as the right-wing protest candidate, or as the tribune of any particular group. “Republican support for Donald Trump just continues to grow with no clear sense of who his constituency really is,” Patrick Murray, who directs the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement accompanying the release of the poll results. “This makes it very difficult for his opponents to figure out how to take him on in the upcoming debate.”","1084","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Obviously, that is good news for Trump, but the polling data also contain some less encouraging signs for him. According to the latest survey from Quinnipiac University’s polling unit, which came out late last week, fifty per cent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, and thirty-three per cent have a negative opinion. If you subtract the latter figure from the former one, you get get a “net positive” rating of seventeen per cent. Far from placing Trump at the front of the G.O.P. field, this figure suggests that he is in thirteenth place, sandwiched between John Kasich and Chris Christie.","1085","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"According to this metric, Marco Rubio is leading the G.O.P. race, with a net positive rating of sixty-one per cent. Walker is in second place, with fifty-five per cent, and Bush is in third place, with fifty per cent. Of course, if Trump performs well in the debates and avoids any major slip-ups, his numbers could improve. But the reason that political professionals monitor this figure closely is that it often indicates the amount of upward (and downward) potential a candidate has. Once negative impressions get entrenched, they are tough to shift, and, relative to most of the other candidates, Trump already has fairly high negative ratings among Republican voters. (Among the electorate as a whole, his negatives are much higher—the highest of any candidate in either party—but that’s not the point here.)","1086","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"As the campaign unfolds and scrutiny of Trump increases, historic precedent suggests that his negative ratings will rise further. That doesn’t mean that he can’t win the nomination or put up a strong showing. It does suggest that it might be worth recalling the fate of previous candidates who have surged to the front of the G.O.P. field in the summer before election year.","1087","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"In early August of 2007, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is a friend of Trump, was leading in some of the G.O.P. polls, and one of his closest competitors was Fred Thompson, a former Republican senator from Tennessee, who hadn’t yet officially announced his candidacy. For example, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey of likely Republican voters showed Giuliani at the top, with thirty-three per cent, and Thompson in second place, with nineteen per cent. John McCain, who went on to win the primary, was in third place, with seventeen per cent. The prominent showings of Giuliani and Thompson both proved ephemeral. By January, 2008, when the primaries began, both had seen their poll ratings fall back. McCain and Mike Huckabee emerged as the leading candidates.","1088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"The 2012 G.O.P. primary also involved a lot of twists and turns. In July of 2011, a survey by the research firm Public Policy Polling showed Michele Bachmann, the conservative congresswoman from Minnesota, narrowly leading Mitt Romney, the favorite. In August, Bachmann went on to win the Ames Straw Poll, in Iowa, with 28.6 per cent of the vote, and Newsweek featured her on its cover. After that, Bachmann fell back steadily.","1089","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"In August of 2011, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, surged to the front of the field. In mid-September, he reached a peak of 31.7 per cent in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, before falling back sharply. Shortly after that, Herman Cain, a businessman and syndicated columnist, replaced Perry as the front-runner. At the start of November, Cain, who was wielding a tax-cutting economic program he called his “9-9-9 plan,” hit twenty-five per cent in the R.C.P. poll average: some individual polls showed him with even more support. By the end of the year, he was back in single figures.","1090","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"
"Trump’s candidacy is sui generis. It shouldn’t necessarily be compared with any of its predecessors, each of which succumbed in a slightly different way. Giuliani and Cain were both hit by allegations of marital infidelity. Perry embarrassed himself in a televised debate. Thompson and Bachmann both committed a series of lesser blunders, which eventually took their toll. Trump, conceivably, could avoid these sorts of errors—although his latest statement, that he’d be willing to shut down the federal government to deprive Planned Parenthood of funding, suggests that he’ll continue to be embroiled in controversy. But my point here is a broader one about the G.O.P. primary electorate. History shows that it’s a volatile and disgruntled beast, which often responds well to candidates it perceives as outsiders. Often, however, the romance doesn’t last. Trump is the latest glamorous newcomer to have tickled the fancy of Republicans. By swallowing up the attention of the media, he’s already done a good deal of damage to other candidates, especially the mid-ranking ones, such as Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, who are now starved of attention. But, until we see how Trump responds to the scrutiny that comes with being the front-runner, and how he performs in the debates, it would be premature to read too much into his current position. In Republican primaries these days, early leads don’t count for much.","1091","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-durable-is-donald-trumps-surge"

"One possible interpretation of these figures is that we are witnessing a temporary phenomenon. At some not-too-distant point, Trump will blow up and the real business of electing a G.O.P. candidate will resume.

"At this stage, he isn’t merely leading in the horse-race polls, which can change rapidly. His overweening presence is driving the G.O.P. toward policy positions, particularly on immigration, that make it virtually unelectable. As Karl Rove and other Republican strategists have realized since the late nineteen-nineties, the party’s future depends on attracting Hispanic voters in such battleground states as Colorado, Florida, and Nevada. Now, Trump is pushing a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport undocumented immigrants, and deprive the children of undocumented parents the right to U.S. citizenship. And other G.O.P. candidates are following his lead.","1098","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"Ted Cruz has praised Trump for focusing on immigration. On Monday, Scott Walker, said that he, too, would eliminate the automatic right to citizenship for children born to undocumented immigrants. Yet another candidate who is struggling in the polls, Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, said the same thing on Twitter. About the only Republicans who pushed back publicly against Trump’s immigration proposal were Carly Florina, who said it was “completely unrealistic”; Lindsay Graham, who described it as “gibberish”; and Kasich, who bravely defended the idea of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, calling them “a very important part of most of our communities.” Jeb Bush, who also supports a path to citizenship, was conspicuously quiet.","1099","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-is-crushing-the-g-o-p-lilliputians"
"Perhaps that’s not surprising. The problem that candidates like Bush and Kasich face is that it’s not just Trump’s celebrity and outspokenness that are attracting support. Many Republican voters say they like Trump on the issues, as unrealistic as his proposals are. When CNN’s pollsters asked Republicans which candidate could best handle illegal immigration, forty-four per cent of them said Trump.

"To repeat: it is still early, and no one should underestimate Trump’s capacity to implode.

"On consecutive days last week, two Republican senators, both of whom are hoping to be the next President, released videos in which they destroyed stuff. First, Rand Paul went at a pile of paper, which he said was the United States tax code, with fire, a wood chipper, and a chain saw. (He wore safety goggles—he may be against regulations, but he’s also an ophthalmologist.) The next day saw Lindsey Graham attacking his Samsung flip phone with a cleaver, a blender, and a golf club. He also dropped a concrete block on it, threw it off a roof, and doused it with lighter fluid and ignited it. These videos suggest that Fox News, which is co-hosting the first G.O.P. Presidential debate, in Cleveland, on August 6th, should have in place firm rules regarding props, and that, perhaps, extra fire marshals should be deployed.

"The loose-haired agent of much of the chaos has been Donald J. Trump. About a week ago, John McCain, the Party’s nominee in 2008, told Ryan Lizza, a writer for this magazine, that Trump had “fired up the crazies” in the G.O.P. with his descriptions of undocumented immigrants as rapists. Trump demanded an apology, and said that, anyway, McCain is “not a war hero.” Graham then asked that Trump “stop being a jackass.” Any New Yorker, having witnessed decades of the Donald, could have told Graham that this wasn’t going to happen. On Tuesday, Trump gave out Graham’s personal cell-phone number at a televised event in South Carolina. “Let’s try it,” Trump told the crowd. That inspired Graham, who had complained that Trump was turning the race “into a circus,” to make his video.","1105","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"

A Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Trump in the lead among the candidates, with twenty-four per cent of the vote. Scott Walker had thirteen per cent, followed by Jeb Bush (twelve), Mike Huckabee (eight), and then, in order of diminishing returns, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Chris Christie, John Kasich (who signed on last week), Bobby Jindal, George Pataki, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, and Lindsey Graham—in last place but with a chance of moving up, now that Trump has made sure that everyone knows where to reach him, as soon as he gets a new phone.","1106","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"The poll results matter, even now, more than a year before the election, because Fox and the Ohio Republican Party, which are co-hosting the first debate (with Facebook), have said that the final five national polls leading up to it will determine who takes part—just the top ten. If things keep going as they are, Trump will be front and center, and he may need to be restrained from slapping a gold-lettered nameplate on the lectern. Another reason that the stakes are so high is that other efforts to cull the field have failed. Jeb Bush, whose campaign and its associated super pac have raised more than a hundred million dollars, can’t shake off the insurgents. In an attempt to make the primaries less of a carnival than they were in 2012, Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, pushed to have only nine sanctioned debates. This creates a strong temptation for candidates to stage a scene while they can. The second debate, in September, hosted by CNN, will also use polls to limit the participants to ten. (CNN and Fox will both hold secondary events for any left-out candidates polling higher than one per cent.)

After Trump insulted Mexicans last month, Bush said that he was personally offended, but others were more cautious. Christie commented that although some of Trump’s remarks may be “inappropriate,” he is “a good guy.” Cruz said, “I think he speaks the truth.” But if Trump weren’t around would the other Republicans behave that much more responsibly?","1108","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"

Cruz announced that “the Obama Administration will become the leading financier of terrorism against America in the world,” and Graham thought that the deal looked like “a death sentence for the State of Israel.” Rubio, in a Trump-like move, said that Obama lacked “class.” Bush and Walker got into a fight about whether they’d renounce the deal and start planning military strikes on Inauguration Day or wait until the first Cabinet meeting. Saying it’s Trump who’s wrecking the Republican Party ignores the ways that he embodies it.","1109","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"
"Trump is not going to be elected, but he is intent enough on staying in the race to have filed financial-disclosure paperwork with the F.E.C.—a step that many observers thought he would stop short of—and he promptly put out a press release stating his worth at “ten billion dollars.” (Forbes estimates four billion; the biggest discrepancy comes from Trump’s assertion that his name alone is worth three billion.) In this election, the post-Citizens United financing mechanisms have fully matured, effectively removing the limits and the disclosure requirements for individual donations to campaigns. The money may have to be laundered through a super pac, but that is just a formality. This distorts the process in both parties and might help explain the large assortment of candidates. Cruz may seem like a preening opportunist, unpopular among his colleagues, but, having attracted more than fifty million dollars in contributions, he is a credible candidate. The Times reported that a significant portion of his early money came from a single donor: Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund executive who is so private that one of the few traces of his personal life in the public record is a lawsuit that he brought against a toy company that installed a model train set in his home and, he felt, overcharged him—by two million dollars.","1110","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/broken"

O’Donnell, later wrote that the ad was “tailored to blue-collar resentments over the trade deficit and to rally Middle America against the machinations, real or supposed, of our foreign allies.” In 2012, Trump updated his view of Asians with a comment about his belief that climate change is a hoax.

Trump said, “Go back to Univision.” While Ramos was in exile in the hallway, a well-dressed man in a suit jacket, wearing a Donald Trump sticker, approached Ramos (who is a U.S. citizen), and said, “This is not about you.

He urged his listeners to support Trump because it was a “great opportunity.” “So he’s certainly the best of the lot. And he’s certainly somebody that we should get behind in terms, ya know, raising the image of this thing.” When Trump was asked, on Bloomberg television, about the support that he has received from Duke and other white nationalists, he said, “I don’t need his endorsement; I certainly wouldn’t want his endorsement.” Asked whether he would repudiate it, Trump said, “Sure, I would if that would make you feel better.”","1116","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-doctrine-we-want-deal"

In the Washington Post this week, George Will wrote, “Every sulfurous belch from the molten interior of the volcanic Trump phenomenon injures the chances of a Republican presidency.” Will ran through a possible arithmetic of defeat: in 2012, Mitt Romney lost non-white voters by sixty-three points. He had relied almost exclusively on white voters—they were ninety per cent of his support—and next year the white percentage of the electorate will be two points smaller than in 2012.

Obviously, they are supportive of the Republican Party’s broader aims, too, but if they are forced to choose between the long-term health of the Party and an immediate jump in audience figures, they will go with the ratings every time.","1121","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"Trump, for all his narcissism and offensiveness, has shown that he can deliver mass audiences. For that reason alone, he is guaranteed plenty of attention from the media outlets that serve as primary news sources for many Republican-primary voters. Bush, the Republican National Committee, and the rest of the party establishment would love to ignore Trump and his antics, but the demands of “free enterprise”—the same free enterprise that Bush lauded in his announcement speech—won’t allow it.","1122","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"In the more serious parts of the Republican media, the attitude toward this great irony appears to be one of resigned acceptance, and, in some cases, gallows optimism. I heard several commentators saying that Trump would make the other G.O.P. candidates look good by comparison. Some conservative commentators appear to understand the dangers, however. “I’m not laughing. I’ll be honest with you, I’m crying,” Michael Graham, the host of the Weekly Standard’s political podcast, said. “I was so hoping he would not get in, just because of the clown show of 2004 and 2008, and how delightful it was going to be that the biggest clowns in the race were going to be Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. And now this TV-show fiasco throws himself into this otherwise energetic, spirited, and worthwhile G.O.P. primary.”","1123","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"The immediate question is whether Trump will gain admission to the upcoming television debates, which start in August. If he is onstage, his presence will be a huge distraction. If he is excluded, he’ll be on the sidelines, crying bloody murder. At the moment, it looks like he will be present. Fox, the host of the first debate, has said that it will invite the top ten candidates in surveys of likely Republican voters. According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, Trump currently sits in ninth place, with 3.6 per cent of the vote. And it seems likely that the publicity surrounding his announcement will give him a bump.","1124","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"
"To be sure, Trump could blow up and withdraw at any time. In 2012, he flirted with running for months and then decided against it. This time, he’s gone further—although, according to reports on Tuesday, he still hasn’t filed the necessary papers with the Federal Election Commission. Once the media starts delving into his financial records and business dealings, which include numerous bankruptcy filings by Trump-branded hotels and casinos, he might well have second thoughts.","1125","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"

"Implacable Resolution: The increasingly familiar chin-up, narrow-eyed Mussolini frown. When Trump listens to a hostile question, his lips are closed, his head squares up to a solid block of orange clay, his corn-silk hair surges resolutely forward and backward at the same time. Expressionless, he nods as the hostile sentence is delivered. By evoking Mussolini’s thrusting chin, I don’t mean to imply that Trump is eager to become a military dictator. He isn’t. Donald Trump is something classically American, an unwavering what’s-in-it-for-me capitalist who likes to crush other people. Yet Mussolini and Trump share something: They appeal to an appreciation, even love, of overwhelming ego strength and extreme machismo, however crass in expression—in fact, the crasser and more preposterous the better (shame doesn’t exist for some public men). Those who are drawn to such strength nestle under it. The hero releases his aggression on the world, the aggression that others would be punished for; his ability to get away with belligerence, insults, lies, and threats makes it easier for his audience to accept caution and silence for themselves. He has triumphed for them, and that’s more than enough.","1129","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Trump’s emotional appeal is similar to that of gangsters everywhere, who act out our most violent and anarchic impulses. In a variant interpretation, Elspeth Reeve, at The New Republic, compared Trump not to a gangster but to the “heel” in pro-wrestling matches—the bad guy whose boasts and offensive behavior and barbarian facial hair are part of a ritual that audiences love. But that isn’t quite right. Professional wrestling is scripted, and Trump is spontaneous and improvisatory. In wrestling, the bad guy always loses, and Trump always wins. He is impervious and unremitting. If he says something stupid, he denies he said it—for instance, his suggestion that Megyn Kelly’s tough questions in the recent Fox-hosted Republican debate were produced by menstruation. Trump went to Wharton, he built a great business, he’s intelligent, so how could he have said it? He didn’t say it. His audience loves him not in spite of such “gaffes” as slamming John McCain’s war record; they love him because he says such things. The senselessness of the McCain attack was essential to its popularity. Trump’s speeches and press conferences are a free-association shambles, his “ideas” a series of boasts. When asked, on Tuesday, how he would bring jobs back from China, he talked about buying a hotel in Miami. For his audience, the only thing that matters is that he asserts himself. Reasoning and consistency are élitist weaknesses.","1130","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Beneath Contempt. His mouth drops down and forms a slightly elongated oval, like a stretched Cheerio. The oval is a prelude to a taunt or a threat. When Kelly asked Trump about his derogatory comments on women, he responded, “What I say is what I say. And honestly, Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry. I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn’t do that.” But he would do it, and continued to do it. Donald Trump has made a shrewd estimate of the distaste, in a part of the Republican base, for virtue or high-mindedness or public spiritedness of any sort—what he dismisses as “political correctness.” Such sentiments are for “losers” who don’t understand that winning is the only thing; they are “stupid.” Obama’s mild reasonableness is particularly enraging to members of the Republican base because they suspect the President is outclassing them. Trump releases them from that fear.","1131","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"You-gotta-be-kidding-me. A wide smile, eyes often closed, palms outstretched. In such moments, Trump presents himself as capitalist man, the spirit of rational calculation. Only an idiot could fail to see that he’s right. When asked by Bret Baier, in the debate, about his past support for Hillary Clinton, Trump responded, “I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.” So his own behavior is part of a corrupt system. The important point for him is not the degradation of representative democracy, but only that Trump gets what he wants. Having won, he can laugh at his own cynicism.","1132","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Trump’s manner is the product of business calculation. But many Americans may not realize how much Trump’s voice and gestures are also shaped by New York—the old, hard New York, before gay rights, smoothies, and Brooklyn, the New York that Trump and I grew up in. His temperament is the residue of a thousand wise-guy tabloid columns, the knowing talk of Seventh-Avenue machers and Irish taxi drivers and mobbed-up guys in the outer boroughs. The flavor of it was there, harmlessly, in the lather-and-hot-towels midtown barber shops of my youth, with their uniformed women attending to gents’ cuticles; benevolently, in the incomparable Broadway musical “Guys and Dolls”; and viciously, in the A.M.-radio rat-a-tat of Walter Winchell. Men like Trump always cut to the chase because, for them, there’s nothing but the chase; they cite the bottom line because it’s the only line that matters; they put down women because there’s no reason, most of the time, to take them seriously. If a woman somehow does attain power, they assume she will use it to destroy men. In Megyn Kelly, Trump sees some golden-haired modern variant of Medusa.","1133","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"People are constantly surprised and shocked by Trump because he doesn’t play by any known set of political rules. Even the three formidable Fox moderators (including Chris Wallace) were limited in their understanding of him by what they expected of political candidates—acknowledgment of some minimal level of consistency, plausibility, and accountability. They thought they could trip him up, even trap him, Tim Russert-style, in his contradictions and political changes. But he answered them with gibberish—silly jokes, non sequiturs, and irrelevant assertions. It’s impossible for Trump to contradict himself, since, as many have said, he has no beliefs, in the sense of ideological beliefs.","1134","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"He exploited the country’s bankruptcy laws when his hotel-casino investments in Atlantic City went sour, and anyway, he got out early and made a lot of money. Got it? He made money. A single-payer system, often known as socialized medicine, “works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you’re talking about here.” (i.e., fifteen years ago). Got it? It works. But the Affordable Care Act, which could be seen as a hesitant first step toward a single-payer system, “is a disaster.” You can’t argue with reasoning like this because it always circles back to Trump’s triumphs over the naïve. He’s gone past contradiction, beyond tautology, into infallibility. In advance of the debate, he stopped studying policy papers. He doesn’t need answers; his temperament is the answer. My guess is that he will persist as long as he’s having fun, not spending much of his own money, and enjoying high poll numbers. Which could be right into the primaries next winter. The Republican Party and the media can’t begin to understand him until they look at his face.","1135","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"What does Donald Trump think war is like? On Saturday, he was onstage at the Family Leadership Summit, in Iowa, with the Republican strategist Frank Luntz, railing against John McCain for having told my colleague Ryan Lizza that he, Trump, had “fired up the crazies,” when Luntz tried to slow him down by noting that McCain was a war hero. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said. As Luntz attempted to remind him why, indeed, McCain was —“Five and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp!”—Trump added, “He’s a ‘war hero’ because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.”","July 20, 2015","1136","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-art-of-the-war-hero"
"He repeated the distinction Monday morning in a phone call to the “Today” show, shouting at Matt Lauer about how he’d been misquoted (he hadn’t been) and how “we don’t talk about the people that weren’t captured, and that’s what I was trying to refer to. And I think I did.”","1137","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-art-of-the-war-hero"
"Put aside, for a moment, that McCain is respected not only for having endured captivity but for the way that he conducted himself—with defiance and even humor, despite being tortured. What is troubling, and telling, is Trump’s suggestion that it is a sign of some special merit to evade capture. Trump doesn’t seem to understand that, in war, the troops who are deployed in, or, as McCain was, sent in a plane over hostile territory and shot down don’t really get to decide whether they are captured. There is a lot of luck involved.","1138","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-art-of-the-war-hero"
"Look, after all, at the luck it took for Trump not to end up in a Vietnamese prison camp. He had four student draft deferments, two while at Fordham and two after transferring, reportedly with the help of family connections, to the University of Pennsylvania, options not available to many of the men who were sent to Vietnam. He got a fifth, somewhat iffy medical deferment (“bone spurs”) before another piece of pure luck: in the 1969 draft lottery, a drawing of pieces of paper on which each date of the year was written, the one bearing Trump’s birthday, June 14th, was the three hundred and fifty-sixth picked—meaning that he was safe, because the highest number actually called for induction was a hundred and ninety-five. (If he’d been born a day earlier, on June 13th, he would have been No. 69.) Trump should know more than most about the fragility of luck—he has been in the casino business, after all. But he thinks that being lucky is a reason for pride, not humility.","1139","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-art-of-the-war-hero"
"After escaping the draft, Trump, whose father was a wealthy real-estate developer, got to work becoming a wealthier business developer. Last week, Trump said that the Obama Administration’s negotiators didn’t get a better deal with Iran because “they didn’t read ‘The Art of the Deal’ ”—Trump’s memoir. “Most people did; they didn’t.” The image of a nuclear deal that looks like a Trump property is not an attractive one: a lot of gold-plated centrifuges, even more tangled accounting.","1140","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-art-of-the-war-hero"
"What is worse, though, is the corollary to Trump’s smugness: his open disdain for people who aren’t fortunate. Being poor, he suggests, is as much the fault of poor people as being rich is entirely to his own credit. If they are not rich, then they are losers—and Trump knows what he thinks about losers. Luntz had originally brought up the war-hero point to ameliorate Trump’s comment that, although he had raised money for McCain’s 2008 Presidential campaign—“a million dollars!”—he had “never liked him much after that, ’cause I don’t like losers.” The contempt he has for undocumented immigrants or for a child in a rough neighborhood is of the same species as that he exhibited toward McCain. He likes the people who aren’t struggling. The other Republican Presidential candidates are now trying to distance themselves from Trump’s slurs against prisoners of war; they have been slow to do the same when it comes to his comments about Hispanics and immigrants and a half dozen other groups. They also need to look at how an unexamined affinity for the wealthy has become part of the G.O.P.’s ethos, too.","1141","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-art-of-the-war-hero"
"But perhaps there’s something else that offends Trump about the praise for John McCain’s war record. McCain’s father was a top military commander, and so he had a chance to get a better place in line, too: the Vietnamese tried to move him up in the order in which prisoners of war were released. He refused. (“I just knew that it wasn’t the right thing to do,” he has said. “I knew they wouldn’t have offered it to me if I wasn’t the son of an admiral.”) At the crucial moment—maybe the decisive one of his life—McCain did not seize a privilege he hadn’t earned. That is the antithesis of the Trumpian view of the world—that is to say, the Trumpian view of Trump.","1142","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-art-of-the-war-hero"
"Sometimes the silliest episodes in politics reveal much larger truths. Consider Donald Trump. Last week, Senator John McCain told me that Trump’s recent anti-immigration rally in Phoenix, Arizona, had “fired up the crazies.” Trump responded by mocking the senator’s academic record—he called him a “dummy”—and then by denigrating McCain’s military service. “He is a war hero because he was captured,” Trump said. “I like people that weren’t captured, O.K.? I hate to tell you.”","July 20, 2015","1143","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"The back-and-forth, which Amy Davidson wrote about today, will one day register as another blip of the 2016 Presidential campaign. But it highlighted at least two important truths about American politics, the first of which is that Republicans remain trapped by a prisoner’s dilemma on the issue of immigration.","1144","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"Republicans almost universally acknowledge that, over the long term, their Party needs to increase its appeal to Latinos in order to win the White House. The first step down that path is to talk about immigrants from Latin America in a respectful way and to marginalize prominent politicians who attack immigrants.","1145","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"However, what is good for the Party over all is not necessarily good for individual candidates. Trump began his campaign for President by suggesting that most immigrants from Mexico were welfare-dependent, job-stealing criminals—some were “rapists,” in fact—who had been coddled by Republicans and Democrats who were too politically correct to tell such hard truths.","1146","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"While there was widespread condemnation of Trump’s comments from Democrats and many media commentators, Trump’s Republican rivals remained largely silent. (Senator Lindsey Graham was a notable exception.) The obvious reason behind this silence is that many voters in the G.O.P. primaries are sympathetic to Trump on the issue of immigration. Yes, the typical Republican candidate might think that the G.O.P., in general, needs to condemn anti-immigrant bigots. But there’s no benefit for any one candidate to speak up. A look at the polls supports this cynical analysis: much of Trump’s rise, which has been fuelled by his immigration tirades, has come at the expense of his most conservative rivals, who all see their opening in the race to the right of Jeb Bush, the candidate of the Republican establishment.","1147","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"Unlike the “rapists” remark, however, the remark about McCain’s capture wasn’t a close call. With the exception of Ted Cruz, who seems to be setting himself up as the Trump voter’s second choice, every Republican Presidential candidate rushed to social media to pillory Trump. That, however, may be too little and too late. If the Party’s long-term existential crisis, especially at the Presidential level, is with Latinos, then it not only missed an opportunity to stand with a population being crassly caricatured by a demagogue, it also signalled that attacking immigrants is O.K., while attacking veterans is out of bounds. The condemnation of the “capture” comment, in that sense, then makes the lack of condemnation of the “rapists” comment look even worse.","1148","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"The second thing the incident showed is that political parties in general, but especially the G.O.P., are becoming impotent. After the 2012 election, the new G.O.P. chairman, Reince Priebus, published a refreshingly honest and relatively unprecedented report about why Mitt Romney lost and how Republicans could win in 2016.","1149","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"One of his most important findings was that Republicans needed to moderate their language on immigration. But he went beyond recommending an image makeover. He said that Congress should pass “comprehensive immigration reform,” a phrase that has a specific meaning in the context of the legislative debates over immigration: a bill that includes enhanced border security, new temporary-worker programs, and—most controversially—a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants already in the United States.","1150","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"Trump, who has dominated Republican-primary coverage for more than a month, and who, in a new ABC poll, has registered his largest lead since he entered the race, in June, has been like a Daisy Cutter to this strategy. He has made his rivals look weak and unwilling to speak up for the Latino community, and he has made it even more difficult than usual for them to embrace the one piece of legislation that the R.N.C. believes is essential for the Party’s future.","1151","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"The R.N.C.’s weakness in the face of Trump’s takeover of the process has been revealed in other ways. In addition to pushing Republicans to embrace immigration reform, Priebus embarked on an effort to make the Presidential primary season less circus-like than it had been in 2012 by keeping down the number of debates and making some adjustments to the primary-voting schedule. Trump has upended those efforts.","1152","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"Priebus has been powerless. In a phone call early this month, he gently encouraged Trump to tone down his rhetoric, but Trump mocked him and ignored him. In recent days, the R.N.C. has claimed that it can’t do much more. It says that F.E.C. rules prevent it from excluding Trump from the debates, and the R.N.C. has been unwilling to further distance itself publicly from Trump.","1153","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"This shouldn’t be too surprising. Ever since the nineteen-seventies, when both parties opened up their nominating systems to become more democratic, the parties have been less and less able to exercise control over the messy system of producing a Presidential nominee. Self-funded personalities with no history of working their way up through the ranks have been a feature of almost every campaign.","1154","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-to-g-o-p-youre-fired"
"Even worse for efforts to control the process, the recent Supreme Court decisions on campaign finance have meant that much of the important work of parties has moved over to Super PACs.

"One can laugh at Trump and his absurdities, but it’s wrong to say that he doesn’t matter.

"“As governor of Florida, I defunded Planned Parenthood,” Bush said. “Donald Trump is good at creating misogynist sound bites, but I’ve actually rolled up my sleeves and gotten things done.”","1175","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/trump-fails-to-back-up-misogynist-slurs-with-anti-woman-proposals-rivals-say"
"Governor Walker piled on, touting his own anti-woman achievements during his time in office. “In Wisconsin, I used my power as governor to repeal a law supporting equal pay for women,” he said. “No offense to Mr. Trump, but nothing on his résumé compares with that.”","1176","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/trump-fails-to-back-up-misogynist-slurs-with-anti-woman-proposals-rivals-say"
"The attacks by Trump’s rivals seemed to sting the hotheaded billionaire, who hit back hard on Friday. “When it comes to coming up with solid anti-woman solutions, I do not intend to be lectured by Jeb Bush and Scott Walker,” he said, noting that the wall he intends to build on the border with Mexico would keep out many women.","1177","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/trump-fails-to-back-up-misogynist-slurs-with-anti-woman-proposals-rivals-say"
"I don’t know about you, but I’m grateful to Donald Trump for one thing. He’s made the first official Republican Presidential debate, which will take place on Thursday night, at Cleveland’s Quicken Loans Arena, a heck of a lot more interesting than it would have been had he decided to sit out the 2016 race. Rarely, if ever, has a debate this early in the primary process created such keen anticipation.","August 5, 2015","1178","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"Not that anyone should expect an in-depth or illuminating discussion of the real issues facing the country, domestic and foreign. With ten candidates onstage, each of whom will probably speak for about ten minutes, it will have the theatricality of a casting call for the lead role in a new Broadway show. One called “Obama The Bad,” perhaps, or “Modern America Sucks.” Based upon what we saw in New Hampshire on Monday night, where fourteen of the Republican candidates appeared together, we can assume there will be frequent fulminations about undocumented immigrants, rote pledges to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and outraged attacks on Planned Parenthood.","1179","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"What makes this debate different is that Trump, who skipped the New Hampshire event, and who is boasting a double-digit lead over his closest rivals, will be standing center stage, with Jeb Bush on one side of him and Scott Walker on the other. Questions abound. How combative will he be? Will any of the others try to take him down? And with so many candidates vying for attention, what tack will the moderators—Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace, all of Fox News—take?","1180","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"Interviewed by Fox’s Bill O’Reilly on Tuesday, the front-runner admitted he’s a bit apprehensive. “You don’t know what is going to come at you,” Trump said. “You don’t know where these other people are going to come. You don’t know whether or not the three folks that are asking the questions are trying to trick you up.” Although Fox is generally supportive of the Republican Party, Baier, Kelly, and Wallace are all experienced journalists who will probably be looking to force the candidates to deviate from their prepared messages. “I’ve got some doozies in there,” Wallace told the Washington Post’s Krissah Thompson, patting his pre-debate binder.","1181","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"The debate will last two hours. Since each candidate will be allotted roughly equal time, the moderators won’t get many chances to interrogate Trump. If they confine their questions to his favorite subjects—immigration and the incompetence of career politicians—he will probably sail through. As he said to O’Reilly, he’s been talking about these things for years, and he’s amply prepared to do so again. But if he’s asked about less familiar topics, or is subjected to awkward questions about his own record, such as a history of associations with companies that filed for bankruptcy, or his unsubstantiated claims about President Obama’s birthplace, he might find things trickier.","1182","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"One or more of the other candidates may also challenge Trump, knowing he is likely to hit back. The billionaire assured O’Reilly that he wasn’t out to hurt anyone, and that he wouldn’t initiate any personal attacks, but added that he would respond if provoked. Appearing on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” on Wednesday, he repeated this message, saying he was hoping for a “civil” debate. This suggests that Trump won’t repeat his criticisms of Jeb Bush—including that Bush can’t win, and describing him as “out of touch with the American people.” Plus, since former Texas governor Rick Perry has failed to make the cut for the prime-time debate, the target of some of Trump’s harshest comments will be absent.","1183","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"If Trump doesn’t go on the offensive, will anybody else?","1184","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"Many political insiders think Bush and Walker would be ill-served by tackling Trump. Quoting George Bernard Shaw, one New Hampshire Republican told Politico, “The old maxim applies: Never wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.” That seems like sound advice. If Trump’s candidacy endures, his principal rivals will eventually have to confront him head-on. But, for now, their primary aim should be to expound on their own platforms, appear to be plausible occupants of the Oval Office, and reinforce their position as the leading orthodox candidates.","1185","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"More interesting is the calculus facing the other seven participants in the debate: Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio. None of these candidates is enjoying a great campaign, and a couple of them—Christie and Paul—are floundering in the polls. This gives them an incentive to lob a few grenades. Since Christie is friendly with Trump, however, it seems unlikely that he will seek to play the role of assassin. Paul has no such ties, and he’s already made dismissive remarks about Trump. Last week, he attributed Trump’s rise in the polls to a “loss of sanity,” adding, “We’re going to come back to our senses and look for someone serious to lead the country at some point.”","1186","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"In addition to a possible set-to between Paul and Trump, political professionals will be monitoring the other second-tier candidates, to see if any of them shows signs of breaking out. Cruz and Huckabee, who are both accomplished public speakers, will be seeking to position themselves as conservative tribunes, as will Carson, the former surgeon, who will be making his début on the national political stage. Rubio, whose poll ratings don’t match his perceived status as one of the leading candidates, needs to make a good impression. Kasich, the governor of Ohio, will also be worth watching. Although he’s only been in the race for a few weeks, he has started out strongly, and some shrewd handicappers regard him as a dark horse.","1187","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"For all of the candidates, Trump included, the first imperative is avoiding a terrible blunder that could upend their campaign, such as the one Perry made, in November, 2011, when he couldn’t remember the name of a federal agency he’d pledged to abolish. (It was the Department of Energy.) In normal circumstances, the possibility of witnessing such harrowing moments is one of things that prompts people to watch Presidential debates. On this occasion, thanks to Trump, the event promises to be compelling viewing regardless.","1188","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-do-you-debate-trump"
"On Monday night, the brief, frantic skirmish between Donald J. Trump and other forces in the Republican Party seemed to have stalled. The weekend had started so well for those in the G.O.P. who thought that their cohorts’ Trump fever might break; on Friday evening, he had besmirched Megyn Kelly, of Fox News—their own Megyn Kelly—in terms that seemed disqualifying. Trump appeared, in short, to have said that a woman they admired was having her period when she was asking hard questions as the moderator of the G.O.P. candidates’ first debate. And who, even among those who took pleasure in Trump’s disparagement of Mexicans (and other immigrants), John McCain (and other prisoners of war), and Rosie O’Donnell (and women generally), wanted to think about something like that? And yet, two days later, it was Trump who, catching his breath from calling his critics “deviants” and “sick,” was tweeting that Kelly’s boss, Roger Ailes, had called him to negotiate a peace. “He is a great guy & assures me that ‘Trump’ will be treated fairly on @FoxNews. His word is always good!”","August 11, 2015","1189","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup"
"A few hours later, Ailes put out a statement confirming the accord, and Kelly, of whom Trump had also said, “She’s zippo … I have no respect for her,” told Fox viewers that it was “time to move forward.” By then, Reuters/Ipsos had released a new, post-debate poll; it found Trump still, somehow, in the lead among Republicans, with twenty-four per cent. Jeb Bush came in second, with twelve per cent. It was a small poll, with a margin of error of more than six per cent, but it was another indication that the debate and the Donald, rather than helping to narrow the field, have left it even more wide open than it was before. And Trump is still crashing through it.","1190","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup"
"Why did the other Republicans think that Trump would crumple in shame? He never has before. It is a measure of the 2016 Presidential race that the strongest point Trump raised in his defense over the weekend—he called into the Sunday news shows on every major channel except Fox—was that, a minute or two after crudely insulting Kelly in a CNN interview (“And you know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her—wherever”), he had crudely insulted her colleague Chris Wallace in similar terms (“You know, blood pouring out of his eyes, too”). By “wherever,” he told George Stephanopoulos, on ABC, “I was referring to nose, ears. They’re very common statements. And only a deviant would think of what people said.” He hadn’t specified those parts, he said, because he just wanted to move on and talk about important things, like “jobs.” In fact, he moved on to talk about how Chris Wallace, in his view, compared to his father, Mike, the longtime CBS correspondent. “The great Mike Wallace was a friend of mine. In fact, he interviewed me on ‘60 Minutes.’ It was a phenomenal ‘60 Minutes’ .… And the son is only a tiny fraction of Mike, believe me.” The lady is a lightweight; the loser never lived up to his dad. These are stock characters in Trumpland, where one can also bump into the occasional Killer or Great Guy.","1191","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup"
"There are, after all, a few problems with Trump’s argument that he was just, in the Wall Street Journal’s memorable phrase, using “facial hemorrhages as a metaphor for anger.” One can begin with the obvious: more of Kelly’s body was implicated than was Wallace’s, and Trump has a long history of slurs aimed at women’s anatomy, which was what Kelly was asking him about. But stranger still is the idea that there was any anger to describe, literally or metaphorically. “Look, she asked me a very nasty question. I have nothing against Megyn Kelly, but she asked me a very, very nasty question,” Trump said. She was “very inappropriate,” and “very angry.” And yet, in the video, she is calm, and never stops smiling. She did not, it is true, surrender or laugh appreciatively when he interrupted her to make a joke about how he thought another woman was ugly. Is that what an angry woman looks like from the Republican debate stage?","1192","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup"
"If Trump is betrayed by the “wherever,” the Republican Party is undermined by its capacity to look at every manner of assault on women and say, in effect, “Whatever.” There is a muddle in the matter of the Party’s message on Trump and Kelly. For one thing, the Republican men rushing to Kelly’s defense do not look much like beacons. Erick Erickson, the conservative activist, said that he was so appalled that he was disinviting Trump from his RedState Gathering conference. Erickson is the man who called Wendy Davis, the Texas legislator, “Abortion Barbie,” and, writing about Michelle Obama, speculated about whether “Obama’s Marxist harpy wife would go Lorena Bobbitt on him.” Kelly once chastised Erickson on Fox for saying that wives contributing more to the family income than their husbands was unnatural and bad for children. (As I’ve written before, Kelly is a smart woman who, occasionally, stops pretending that the men around her at Fox are making any sense at all.) At the RedState conference, Jeb Bush congratulated Erickson on his gentlemanliness in disinviting Trump, saying, “I tell you what, you’re on the side of women.” Bush, who had turned to the topic when Erikson mentioned his wife, continued, “Come on! Give me a break. I mean, do we want to win? Do we want to insult fifty-three per cent of all voters? What Donald Trump said is wrong.”","1193","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup"
"The problem is that Bush and the other Republicans are not clear in their own minds about why Trump is wrong. Last week, Bush said, “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women’s health issues” (he later said that he “misspoke”)—a quote Trump brought up on the Sunday shows, when talking about how he would be “phenomenal to the women” who were, themselves, phenomenal. There is plenty of menstruation-free misogyny at play, starting with the assumption that women are an alien group “we” have to be careful not to offend. The hope among Republicans is that they will never have to say whether their politely unspoken assumptions are the same as Trump’s loudly stated one—that, having roused the base, Trump is so crass that he will flame out. Jeb Bush seems particularly vulnerable to this presumption. But this does not seem to be a political moment in which tackiness alone is going to get someone off the debate stage. The greatest fear, within the G.O.P., seems to be that Trump will force them to look rude. And it has left them paralyzed.","1194","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup"
"It was a classic Trump move to ask, with outrage and wounded innocence, why anyone would think that mentioning blood and a woman’s anger in the same sentence would have a certain implication. (It’s actually a decent question, as disingenuous as Trump was to pose it.) His G.O.P. opponents thought that the answer was too obvious and unpleasant to talk about. The offense for them was the application of a stereotype to Kelly. They weren’t about to engage with or challenge any stereotypes about women themselves.","1195","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup"
"When the other G.O.P. candidates challenge Trump, it tends to be by arguing that he is not a real Republican—he was once pro-choice, and he has given money to Democrats. On the first point, the G.O.P. risks alienating women voters when candidates, like Marco Rubio, rush to stake out ever more extreme positions on restricting reproductive rights, a point that Hillary Clinton seized upon on Monday. On the issue of political donations, Trump’s comment, in the debate, that he gives money to all sorts of candidates to buy access and to get them to do what he wants, has been a hard one for his opponents. They seem to find talking about their donors almost as mortifying as talking about Megyn Kelly’s body. At the debate, Trump had said that Clinton had to go to his wedding because he’s donated to her family’s foundation. Clinton said that she’d gone because she “thought it was going to be fun.” Did the G.O.P. think that a Trump candidacy would be fun, too?","1196","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup"
"“I do whine because I want to win,” Trump said on Tuesday morning. “And I’m not happy about not winning, and I am a whiner, and I keep whining and whining until I win.”","1197","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup"
"If you decided to skip last night’s Republican debate, you made an error.

"Donald Trump, as expected, was the big story of the night, but not in a way he would have wished. From the beginning, the three Fox moderators—Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace—appeared to be on a mission to knock him off his perch as the Republican front-runner, or, at least, to prove that he was worthy of the position.","1199","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Biff. That was Baier, with the first question of the evening, addressed to all the candidates but seemingly designed to force an acknowledgment from Trump that he wouldn’t necessarily support the Republican nominee and might end up running as a third-party candidate. (Boos rang out from the crowd at the Quicken Loans Arena.)","1200","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Bang. That was Kelly, with her first question to Trump, reminding him that he had described women as fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. “Only Rosie O’Donnell,” Trump interjected with a forced smile, but Kelly was in no mood for humor. “For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O’Donnell,” she said sternly. Obviously somewhat taken aback, Trump tried to downplay his sexist remarks as “fun, it’s kidding,” and then complained, peevishly, that Kelly hadn’t been nice to him.","1201","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Wallop. The sound of Wallace landing another haymaker on Trump’s comb-over, this time in the form of a question about four firms bearing his name that have filed for bankruptcy protection. Given a record like that, Wallace asked, why should we trust you with the nation’s finances? Trump replied that these were just four deals out of hundreds he’d done, and that, like many businessmen, he had only been using the bankruptcy laws to his advantage. And he personally had never gone bankrupt, he added. He should have stopped there, but he didn’t. When Wallace followed up with a question about the last bankruptcy, of the Atlantic City-based Trump Entertainment Resorts, in 2009, which cost nearly a thousand jobs, he couldn’t resist another tribute to his capitalist acumen: “I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City before it cratered,” he said. “I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I’m proud of it.”","1202","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"There were more tricky questions—about his many political flip-flops, and about the lack of evidence that he has provided to back up his claim that Mexico is sending criminals across the border to the United States. If it had been a prize fight and the judges had been members of the political commentariat, they would probably have adjudged Trump a standing eight count, or even stopped the contest before he suffered more punishment, some of it self-inflicted.","1203","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"But, of course, the judges are ordinary Republican voters, many of whom share Trump’s disdain for the political class, including political journalists. (“They are a very dishonest lot, generally,” he said at one point.) In the recent past, Trump’s run-ins with the media have only helped him, and we’ll have to wait for some post-debate polls to see whether this happens again. Although on the defensive for much of the time, he didn’t back down, and he came across, as he always does, as a man apart from the rest of the field. That, of course, is the key to his popularity.","1204","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Perhaps the most bizarre moment was when Trump responded to yet another tough question, this one from Baier, about why, in the past, he had made financial contributions to Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton. Trump said that he had contributed to “everybody,” including several people on the stage, and explained that his donations were strictly transactional. “When they call, I give,” he said. “And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me.” His donations to the Clinton Foundation provided an example of how this worked, Trump went on. “Hillary Clinton: I said, ‘Be at my wedding,’ and she came to my wedding. She had no choice, because I gave to a foundation.”","1205","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"It barely needs saying that advertising on national television that you bought at least one of your wedding guests isn’t standard practice for political candidates during debates. But it was that sort of night: downright freaky. At one point, Chris Christie and Rand Paul looked to be heading for a brawl over whether the government should gather the phone records and other private data of ordinary Americans. (Paul was con, Christie was pro.) At another juncture, Trump and Jeb Bush got all lovey-dovey. “He is a true gentleman, he really is,” the former said of the latter, after the latter denied having called the former “a clown” and “a buffoon.”","1206","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Not simply because they both have jet-black hair, Scott Walker and Ted Cruz appeared to be competing for the title of baddest, darkest, deadliest conservative of all. Walker took an early lead by bringing up Planned Parenthood and Hillary Clinton’s e-mail troubles. But Cruz, who never allows anyone to outflank him on the right, made up some ground late by suggesting that he had led the fight against Planned Parenthood, and pledging that, on his first day in the White House, he would “rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama.”","1207","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Mike Huckabee, who also ran in 2008, didn’t say anything much of note. Delivering his closing statement, he seemed more like the proprietor of an auto shop than a man gunning for the White House. “I think America is in trouble, but it is not beyond repair,” he said. Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon turned politician, spoke softly, rarely pausing to sully his presentation with actual policy details. “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins,” he said in his closing statement. “The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.”","1208","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Through it all, Bush tried to act all grown-up, Presidential, and voter-friendly. He defended his immigration stance, which includes providing a path to citizenship. He banged on about education and his record as governor of Florida, as he always does, and he avoided any nasty entanglements with Trump, or anybody else. The folks I watched the debate with, none of whom are political professionals, thought he made a pretty good go of it. On Twitter, the political experts said that he seemed nervous and halting.","1209","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"For my part, I thought Bush did at least as well as Senator Marco Rubio and Governor John Kasich, the home-town boy, whom many of the pundits hailed as the victors. Then again, Rubio almost always gets good reviews from the professionals. It is the Republican voters who have left him languishing, with about five-per-cent support in the opinion polls. Kasich, cheered by the crowd, appeared to be positioning himself as a more proletarian, Midwestern version of Bush. Most of his policy positions are solidly right-wing; his record is solidly right-wing. But he has one issue on which he’s broken ranks with his party—Medicaid. He said repeatedly that the Republican Party needed to present an inclusive and optimistic platform, and, in his swan song, he added, “People have hope again in Ohio.”","1210","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"In the end, though, the story was Trump, whose message was more downbeat. “Our country is in serious trouble,” he said in his closing statement. “We don’t win anymore. …We can’t do anything right.” Shortly after he left the stage, he complained to reporters about how he had been treated, noting that several of the other candidates had remarked to him that he had received the toughest questions. “I think Megyn behaved very nasty to me,” he said. Then, perhaps realizing that he sounded a bit ridiculous complaining about a debate moderator doing her job, he added, “I had a really great time. I thought it was a fantastic debate.”","1211","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

But if we are really interested in the outcome of the election in November, 2016, and the ultimate welfare of the country, they are much more significant. Taken together, they show how the G.O.P. is facing a dilemma that goes well beyond the fact that, for now, its Presidential primary has been hijacked by a self-promoting megalomaniac.","August 12, 2015","1255","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"The first announcement is that the “big-government crisis” is over. What big-government crisis? you may ask. The one that the Republicans cooked up in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when, partly owing to a slump in output, and partly owing to the Obama stimulus and other recession-related outlays, federal spending as a proportion of G.D.P. rose by about four percentage points—from 19.1 per cent in 2007 to 23.4 per cent in 2010. On the back of these figures, some G.O.P. scaremongers portrayed the President as a crypto-socialist intent on strangling the private sector and turning the United States into Sweden, Norway, or some other bloated welfare state where living standards are considerably higher than they are in the United States.","1256","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"Of course, none of the Republicans mentioned the last bit, but you get my drift. With federal expenditures rising sharply, the critics demanded big cutbacks, and they are still demanding them. At last week’s G.O.P. debate, virtually all of the candidates talked about lifting the oppressive yoke of government, and Jeb Bush repeated his pledge to cut the federal work force by ten per cent.","1257","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"What the Republicans don’t seem to have noticed is that their demand for a substantial downsizing has already been met. Thanks to a prolonged, if unspectacular, recovery in G.D.P., and to budget cuts endorsed by both parties at the local and national levels, the size of the government has been steadily falling relative to the rest of the economy. You can see this in the official statistics for federal outlays, which in 2014 fell back to 20.4 per cent of G.D.P. And you can see it even more clearly in the figures for government spending of all types, which includes spending at the local and state levels, as well as transfer payments and interest on the national debt.","1258","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"At the start of 2008, according to a valuable new analysis by David Beckwith, an economist at Western Kentucky University who formerly worked at the Department of the Treasury, this broader measure of government spending came to about thirty-five per cent of G.D.P. By the start of 2012, the figure had risen to close to forty-two per cent of G.D.P. That’s not quite at Scandinavian levels of spending, but it represented a significant jump. Since then, however, there has been a big drop, and over-all spending is back close to thirty-five per cent of G.D.P. In Beckwith’s words, “The huge run up in total government expenditures during the crisis is largely gone.”","1259","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"My second announcement is that Obamacare—the G.O.P.’s primary exhibit in its case that the Democrats are leading the country to rack and ruin—is doing what it was designed to do, which was to bring down the number of uninsured.","1260","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"The source here is a new set of figures published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday. They show that the number of Americans without any health coverage has fallen from sixteen per cent of the population in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, to 9.2 per cent in the first three months of this year. For the first time in recent memory, the percentage of uninsured people is in the single figures. “The health law remains controversial, and that will likely continue to be the case,” Larry Levitt, a senior vice-president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focusses on health care, told the Huffington Post’s Jonathan Cohn. “But we now have facts that can be used to judge the A.C.A. rather than hypothetical arguments, and there’s no doubt at this point that more people are getting insured and it’s making a difference in their lives.”","1261","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"If any of the G.O.P. hopefuls, or anybody at the Republican National Committee, have publicly acknowledged either of these developments, I must have missed their statements. Rather than dealing with what’s actually happening, most of the G.O.P. candidates are still trying to outdo each other in their animus toward the federal government and its works, particularly the Affordable Care Act.","1262","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"A reasoned conservative response to the experience of Obamacare would be to accept the fact that it has done much of what it set out to do without bankrupting the country or destroying jobs, while also pointing out that it has had some nasty unintended consequences, such as a lack of competition among insurers in some areas and, in others, an increase in deductibles so large it may discourage people from seeking the care they need. But, rather than go down this route, almost all of the Republicans continue to demand an outright repeal of the law, without giving a coherent explanation of what they would replace it with.","1263","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"Which, in a way, isn’t surprising. Given how far to the right the Party’s base has shifted, adopting such a stance may be the only way to win the nomination.","1264","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"There’s probably more to it than that, though. If you take away from the G.O.P. its claims that government is running amok, the economy is in the tank, and Obamacare is a disaster, what issues does it have left? A possible list would include immigration, Planned Parenthood, ISIS, and Hillary Clinton’s e-mail server. Maybe I’m missing something, but that hardly sounds like a recipe for victory in the general election. The Republicans don’t just have a Trump problem: they have a reality problem.","1265","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"Donald Trump’s lead among the Republican candidates for President continues to be the strangest thing about the latest polls—about American politics, in general. But what may be more consequential is that, in some polls, Jeb Bush, the supposed front-runner, isn’t in second place; he’s in third, behind Scott Walker. The numbers have been close, often with just a percentage point between them (fourteen per cent for Bush, fifteen for Walker, nineteen for Trump, in a Wall Street Journal poll released Monday), and, in a Fox News poll released Tuesday, Bush gained ground (fifteen per cent to Walker’s nine, and Trump’s twenty-six). With the lift from the Fox numbers, the Real Clear Politics average has Bush ahead of Walker by about two points, which is within the margin of error. But a tie is a loss for Bush. He has drawn in a hundred and twenty million dollars in campaign funds—about ninety million more than Walker has. Bush should be beating him and Trump; he should be beating everybody. Instead, he goes into the first debate Thursday night with the risk that Trump will make him petulant and the other candidates will make him look soft and privileged. With that setup, Walker could win the debate.","August 4, 2015","1266","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"Could he win the nomination? The problem with a money lead like Bush’s is that, in the post-Citizens United system, money can be raised, in large quantities, very, very quickly. A candidate no longer needs the infrastructure of veteran bundlers who will round up twenty-seven-hundred-dollar checks from hundreds of people. There can be one big check—written to a Super PAC, rather than a campaign, but that’s stopped making much of a difference. A Times analysis found that, so far, just a hundred and thirty individuals or families have given half the money for Republican candidates. According to the paper, “At least $13.5 million of the $20 million raised by Mr. Walker’s super PAC came from just four donors.” Diane Hendricks, of Wisconsin, described as a “roofing billionaire,” gave five million. Bush, until now, has been the beneficiary of the dutiful G.O.P. money, from the donors who are simply going to be there for the Party’s candidate, and think that it’s going to be him. But, if there’s doubt, he’ll have to share the wealth.","1267","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"Walker is looking for it. This weekend, he was at a retreat for Freedom Partners, a network associated with David and Charles Koch, in Southern California, to answer questions before an audience of big donors. So were, by invitation, Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Carly Fiorina. (Trump, who wasn’t, said that the others had gone to “beg,” and wished them good luck with that.) When the moderator, Mike Allen, of Politico, asked if Walker was intimidated by the amount of money that Bush had raised, he said, “He’s done a good job with connections to the family. And that’s great.”","1268","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"That reply suggests another possible move for Walker, when it comes to differentiating himself from Bush. He is the regular guy, not the son and the brother of a President. In the debate Thursday night, Trump might well make that point for him, either with an outright insult or a reminder that Bush, even with his name and his institutional support, hasn’t been able to close the deal. (The irony of Trump having been born into wealth is not likely to slow down Trump.) Bush went to Andover and then graduated from the University of Texas, and before he became governor of Florida he had a business career that can make him look like a meandering trader in influence. Walker dropped out of Marquette University, worked briefly in marketing for a local Red Cross chapter, and then, when he was still in his twenties, went into politics. He doesn’t have a college degree. If a Clinton is running against a Bush, the dynastic complaint is cancelled out. The dynamic of a confrontation between Scott Walker and Hillary Clinton would be markedly different, and perhaps more dangerous for Clinton.","1269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"Walker is best known for his systematic efforts, as the governor of Wisconsin, to destroy labor unions. These have gone well beyond haggling over the terms of contracts for state employees to a dismantling of the mechanisms of collective bargaining in both the public and the private sector. (Dan Kaufman wrote recently in the Times Magazine about how Walker succeeded in getting anti-union measures passed with an approach that the governor himself described as “divide and conquer”—something that could be useful with the overcrowded Republican field.)","1270","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"His ability to pass “right to work” legislation in Wisconsin, and his promise to do so on a federal level, is a draw for conservatives. But it’s a hard call as to whether the Koch circle is more drawn to that or to his resistance to environmental regulations, particularly those aimed at the fossil-fuel industry, and his contempt for efforts to limit climate change. (The Kochs’ network is not endorsing a primary candidate, but David Koch has said that he leans toward Walker, and the brothers have financially supported his campaigns for governor.) Summing up Walker’s environmental record, Vox noted, almost with awe, that he “doesn’t even like recycling.”","1271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"At the Koch event, when Walker was asked if he thought that President Obama was a Christian, he said, “I don’t know.” He has said this before, qualifying it only with a willingness to “presume” that Obama is not lying when he says that he is a Christian. The appeal to Tea Partiers and birthers is not subtle. Walker has also spoken out against marriage equality, despite his own children’s views to the contrary and the marriage of a family member to another woman. He told reporters that he attended the reception, but stayed away from the ceremony.","1272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"Walker is reportedly studying hard for the debate. In particular, he wants to show that he can give persuasive answers on foreign policy. In February, at a Conservative Political Action Conference, in response to a question about what he might do about ISIS, he referred to the angry protests in Madison during his anti-union battle, which led to a failed recall drive. If he were President, Walker said, the United States would","1273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"Walker’s comparing supporters of American labor with Islamist terrorists generated so much mockery that his even more alarming stated commitment to a broadly conceived interventionist policy (“here or anywhere in the world”) got less attention than it should have. But the comparison wasn’t a gaffe; it was Walker’s conception of history. William Finnegan, in a Profile of Walker in The New Yorker, quoted his comments on Ronald Reagan’s destruction of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization: “That was the first crack in the Berlin Wall and the fall of Communism, because from that point forward the Soviets and the Communists knew that Ronald Reagan wasn’t a pushover.” As PATCO falls, so falls the Soviet empire. Trump is not the only Republican candidate with an odd sense of scale, or lack of perspective. There are many absurdities still to be wagered with in this race. And there is so much money to put on the table.","1274","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"

"“Get a warrant! Get a judge to sign the warrant!” Senator Rand Paul, of Kentucky, shouted, about a quarter of the way through the first Republican Presidential debate, last night in Cleveland. His target was New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, but one might be forgiven for thinking that he was warding off some unseen men, equipped with handcuffs or straitjackets, come to take him—or possibly another of the ten candidates on the stage—away. But which one? The debate, hosted by Fox News, Facebook, and the Ohio G.O.P., was supposed to bring on a winnowing of the field. That doesn’t seem to have happened. No candidate looked dominant—not Donald Trump, who talked about all the politicians he had bought (“When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. … With Hillary Clinton, I said, ‘Be at my wedding,’ and she came to my wedding”), and not Jeb Bush, with his uncomprehending answers about his family connections (“Maybe the barrier—the bar’s even higher for me”). The minor candidates solidified their toeholds; the field even seemed to expand, as the moderators played a video clip of Carly Fiorina, who was seen as the winner in the earlier debate among seven low-polling candidates who didn’t make the cut for the prime-time stage. At one point, the candidates were asked whether God spoke to them directly. This could go on for a long time.","August 7, 2015","1290","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"Trump did make it clear that, if Trump were the nominee of the Republican Party, he would support Trump. The debate opened with a call for candidates to raise their hands if they couldn’t commit to supporting whoever the Republican nominee might be and who might consider running as an independent. It yielded what was, no doubt, the intended result: Trump, stage center, standing alone, hand raised, wondering why he should “respect” anyone given his position in the race. (“I’m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.”) Maybe that’s when he decided that the moderators didn’t like him. Megyn Kelly asked about his tendency toward misogynistic insults: “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals.’ ” Trump interrupted to say that it was “only Rosie O’Donnell”—an unparalleled moment in drive-by ad-hominem debate attacks. But O’Donnell (who tweeted, “try explaining that 2 ur kids”) wasn’t the woman in front of him, and so, after barking something about political correctness, he said, “And honestly, Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry. I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.”","1291","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"Kelly smiled. A few minutes later, she asked Scott Walker about his opposition to abortion even in cases when the mother’s life was in danger. “Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion?” she asked. Walker equivocated, essentially insisting that such a choice never really came up. But then there was never a moment in the debate that Walker really seized. (On Russia: “You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop.”) Walker, who has ranked ahead of Bush (though behind Trump) in some polls, may have had the most to gain in the debate. Instead, he plodded along, even as the abortion discussion veered into anti-choice one-upmanship, with Huckabee invoking “DNA schedules” as a reason to give fetuses Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Trump said that he’d “evolved” from the pro-choice views he’d held in the nineteen-nineties, in part because he had some friends who “were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn’t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar.”","1292","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"But where were the debate superstars? Cruz was more like a lava lamp. He seemed so oleaginous as he outlined hidden Iranian plots, and yet he has a core of fans who consider him profound; its members will be pleased with how he did. Cruz was upset that President Obama hadn’t defended crusaders and the Inquisition. Paul was upset that Christie had hugged Obama. Christie said that his more memorable hugs had been with the families of 9/11 victims. He also said that it was “completely ridiculous” for Paul to talk about limiting the National Security Agency’s surveillance of ordinary Americans. Christie wasn’t alone. When Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon, was asked whether he would countenance waterboarding, he said that “what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business,” as though there were no international Convention Against Torture, or simple ethical constraints. Huckabee said, “The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things.”","1293","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"The most fractured rhetoric on the purpose of American military action, though, came from Bush, and in a way that shows his weakness as a candidate. Kelly asked him how he could look at the families of soldiers who’d died in Iraq “and say that your brother’s war was a mistake.” His answer had a stream-of-consciousness quality to it. Bush mentioned twice how difficult it had been for him to talk to families of soldiers in Florida (“It was really hard to do”), said that Obama shouldn’t have left Iraq, and ended with something like a non sequitur about how “to honor the people that died, we need to—we need to—stop the—Iran agreement, for sure.” He has been asked this question, in one form or another, more times than there are Republican candidates in the primaries. He still doesn’t have an answer.","1294","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"Is it Trump’s fault that Bush comes across as well-mannered but nebulous? Trump does encourage brute branding. When one of the moderators said, “Mr. Trump, Obamacare is one of the things you call a disaster,” Trump corrected him: “Complete disaster.” But the other contestants seemed able to figure out what character they are playing in this reality show—Bush hasn’t yet, given that the role of “undisputed front-runner” doesn’t seem to be available. Rubio, for example, talked brightly about how Hillary Clinton wouldn’t be able to “lecture” him; he’s kept himself in for another few rounds. Rubio also suggested that anyone who complained about his lack of experience was aiding the enemy, since Clinton would win a “résumé competition.” The G.O.P. primary race certainly isn’t one of those. It is a collection of niche candidates, and the niches are so entrenched that it is hard to imagine how they will be shaken out. There is even a semi-sensible niche, occupied in this debate by John Kasich, the governor of Ohio. He made obvious points that have eluded many in his party: about not turning down Medicaid money that could help people in his state, or how, if he learned that his daughters were lesbians, his love for them would be what it always was: “unconditional.” The audience cheered for that. But it also cheered when Huckabee complained about the military trying to accommodate transgender soldiers. Bush, meanwhile, tried to explain who he was by citing nicknames others had given him. He boasted about being known as “Veto Corleone,” and later said, “In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it.” How do you earn a Jeb? And how is Jeb going to earn this nomination?","1295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"“Our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid,” Donald Trump said, surrounded by leaders and politicians. A sign that the system was broken, he said, was how many of them listened to him politely—“You know, most of the people on this stage I’ve given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.” Apart from Rand Paul, the other candidates left the task of going after him to the moderators. (Afterward, Trump complained that Kelly “behaved very badly.“) Chris Wallace, of Fox, pressed Trump on the bankruptcy of four businesses that had been associated with him. Trump responded by offering up the sort of knowing assertions about how the system is rigged, which he tosses out to his supporters like coins. “I’m not going to name their names because I’m not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they’ve used the law. … When I use it, it’s like, ‘Oh, Trump, Trump, Trump.’ ”","1296","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"And more Trump. Before the bankruptcy question was done with, he’d insulted Atlantic City, saying of his creditors, who’d lost a billion dollars, “These lenders aren’t babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, O.K.?” Trump is here to confirm your fears, about killers and criminals, both among people in business or those trying to cross the border—“If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal immigration”—and then to offer something shiny. The wall that he’d build along the length of the border (“Mexico’s going to pay for it,” he told Bill O’Reilly last week) could, he said, have “a big beautiful door”—a classy one, no doubt. After the debate, Trump told Fox News’s Sean Hannity, “We had such a great crowd, and they really agreed with what I said,” which is a measure more of his gleeful shamelessness than the debate’s reality. Trump is having fun; he’s not about to leave. He’s ready to earn his Donald.","1297","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"

"In the United States, our most successful demagogues have often become so by making skillful use of whatever the newest media was at the time. Charles Coughlin, the Catholic priest who railed against Jews and capitalism in the nineteen-thirties, did most of his railing via the radios that the American masses had just recently acquired. In the early fifties, Joseph McCarthy took advantage of television’s advent to attract gavel-to-gavel attention for his congressional hearings. Donald Trump is a celebrity demagogue, and, for the moment, anyway, the leading Republican Presidential candidate, because of reality television and Twitter.","August 12, 2015","1316","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-g-o-p-s-misogyny-primary"
"Both forms shaped Trump’s persona: he’s their creature. On his own reality-TV show, “The Apprentice,” and now on the campaign trail, Trump displays the particular personality traits that get amped up, hyped, and rewarded on the crassest of these series: he’s as thin-skinned, tantrum-prone, “outrageous,” and narcissistic as a “Real Housewives” villain.","1317","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-g-o-p-s-misogyny-primary"
"Trump also does a lot of his posturing on the Internet, where trollish taunts can win you a following, and where women sometimes come in for particular contempt. He has a taste for that, too, as we all know now, if we didn’t before the debate last Thursday.","1318","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-g-o-p-s-misogyny-primary"
"Here in America, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, sexism is very much on the wane, but misogyny is not. Sexism—the conviction that women don’t deserve equal pay, political rights, or access to education—can be combatted by argument, by anti-discrimination laws, and by giving women the opportunity to prove their ability. Misogyny is not amenable to such advances; they can in some circumstances exacerbate it, though they may drive it underground. An example of misogyny is when someone online threatens to rape and mutilate a woman whose opinions that person does not like. Another is when a Presidential candidate says of a female journalist whose questions he finds impertinent, “There was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her—wherever.”","1319","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-g-o-p-s-misogyny-primary"
"The day after Trump made his comment about Megyn Kelly, he was disinvited from the RedState network’s annual conference of G.O.P. leaders. RedState’s editor-in-chief, Erick Erickson, who is also a Fox News commentator, explained, “As much as I do personally like Donald Trump, his comment about Megyn Kelly on CNN is just a bridge too far for me.” He went on, “There are just lines of decency a person running for president should not cross.” That may have been cheering to Republican women. The defense of some sort of decorum in public life seems like a reasonable position to stake out, especially for a true conservative. Ross Perot, the last shoot-from-the-hip, vote-for-me-I’m-a businessman, Republican-ish candidate we saw on the Presidential debate stage, was not given to insulting women. So on one level, Trump’s preening misogyny and gross-out insinuations are something new—a weird product of his own personality and the id-indulging media through which he generally communicates. In their exchange at last week’s debate, Kelly reminded him, “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals,’ ” and then asked if that called to mind “the temperament of a man we should elect as President.” It was a legitimate question, but Trump offered no real answer, let alone regret; the problem, he said, was “political correctness.” None of the other nine candidates onstage countered this interpretation. So, if a fellow Republican were put off enough to cancel a speaking invitation for Trump, that seemed promising. It was a little deflating when one considered that Erickson himself was prone to Trump-like woman-baiting. (A tweet from 2010, spotted by my colleague Ryan Lizza: “Good thing I didn’t suggest the feminists … you know … shave. They’d be at my house trying a post-birth abortion on me”).","1320","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-g-o-p-s-misogyny-primary"
"The Republican Presidential candidates’ debate last week, in Cleveland, provided an opportunity to think about the relationship between this kind of misogyny and the eagerness to stake out a more and more draconian position on abortion. I’ve never believed that being anti-abortion makes you a woman-hater. People hold anti-abortion views for many reasons, including, most fundamentally, the belief that life begins at conception. But it’s hard not to see some sort of misogyny in the unseemly scramble to plant a flag at the very farthest frontier of anti-abortion territory, positively eager to reiterate, as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker did, that bans on abortion should include no exception to save the life of a woman. Rare as such situations are—anti-abortion advocates are right to say that they don’t occur often—why would you want to bar even the possibility of saving a woman’s life over that of the fetus she is carrying? And whatever their motivation or intentions, the effect of the substantial restrictions on abortion that the Republican candidates favor would be damaging to women.","1321","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-g-o-p-s-misogyny-primary"

"This will be the first and the last time Donald Trump is described as a model of restraint, but let it be said: at his Presidential announcement speech, in New York last Tuesday, Trump managed to stand in front of a microphone for more than forty minutes, his mouth moving for the duration, without taking a single jab at Hillary Clinton. In this way he distinguished himself from the rest of the Republican field. The day before, in Miami, Jeb Bush swiped at Clinton—twice by name and a few more times by obvious implication—in his own announcement speech. Last month, launching his campaign, Marco Rubio posited himself as a perfect contrast to Clinton, warning that “a leader from yesterday began a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday. Yesterday is over.” (So is Trump’s restraint: within hours of his speech, he flew to Des Moines and accused Clinton of “playing the woman card really big.

Now, with Clinton officially running and the Republican field nearly complete, the scattershot censure of the past few months has begun to coalesce into several reasonably distinct lines of attack.

The “brick phone,” in fact, is a favorite reference of Rubio, who is forty-four, and who has said that the Clintons arrived in Washington back when people were lugging those two-pounders around. Never mind that Motorola’s DynaTAC 8000X is a relic of the Reagan era, not of the nineteen-nineties (the age of the clamshell).

Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman, has also found his inner egalitarian, telling a gathering of conservatives in February that “if there’s not a private luxury jet and a quarter-million-dollar speaking fee waiting for her, you can forget” seeing Hillary Clinton in public.

Her stewardship of the failed health-care plan during the Clinton Administration associated her with “big government,” though she has done little in the past twenty years to reinforce that impression. No matter. If the Democrats ran a blue dog for President—not a centrist “blue dog” Democrat but an actual, barking blue dog—Republicans would call it a “liberal,” as Fiorina, Bush, and others are calling Clinton now. To Fiorina, Clinton’s announcement speech was a “long litany of left-wing causes”; Walker saw it as confirmation that “her views are out of touch with mainstream America.” Bush has been more precise. In April, he e-mailed supporters about a speech that Clinton gave on the rights of women and girls. “Hillary Clinton,” Bush wrote, “said that people’s deep-seated religious beliefs need to be changed in order to advance her own personal political agenda. Wow.” She didn’t say that, but Bush—to ingratiate himself with the religious right, which distrusts him—repeated the charge last Monday.

Fiorina has been goading Clinton to “name an accomplishment” from her time at the State Department, while Fiorina’s rivals see a highlight reel of destruction. Ted Cruz has been rumbling about the “Obama-Clinton” axis for months now. Bush charges that a “phone-it-in foreign policy” is “leaving a legacy of crises uncontained, violence unopposed, enemies unnamed, friends undefended, and alliances unravelling.” (If that sounds like the rap on his brother’s Administration, Jeb is leaving the ironies unacknowledged.)

"“I think people wonder,” Romney said on “Morning Joe,” “can they really trust Hillary Clinton?” Not if the G.O.P. can help it. And, in truth, Clinton has not helped herself on this score. Her use of a personal e-mail account to conduct State Department business and the Clinton Foundation’s acceptance of donations from foreign governments have stoked the engines of indignation on the right. Fiorina told a group of party activists that Clinton “tweets about women’s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights.” To Cruz, Clinton “embodies the corruption of Washington,” which is putting it mildly compared to Rand Paul, who charges both Clintons, flatly, with thinking that “they are above the law.”","1349","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"
"The focus on Hillary Clinton’s character is the one line of attack that appears to be registering with the broader electorate. Last Wednesday, Quinnipiac reported a “continuing slide” in the percentage of swing-state voters who view Clinton as honest and trustworthy. In Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the trust deficit is eight to fourteen points. It is unclear whether the Republican candidates can claim credit for this, or whether news coverage is what has driven Clinton’s numbers down. Certainly, the press corps has pursued the e-mail story and dug into the Clinton Foundation’s finances without any need of encouragement from the G.O.P.","1350","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"
"There is danger for Clinton in the trust gap, if it opens wider. When a candidate isn’t trusted to say what she means or do what she says, then it ceases to matter, really, what proposals she offers on renewable energy. But “trust,” as measured by polling firms, is an abstraction. The question that will decide the election is not “Do you trust this nominee?” but “Do you trust this nominee more than you trust the other nominee to make progress on the issues that matter to you?” On that question, Clinton should like her odds. While Bush, in the Quinnipiac poll, beats Clinton by four points on who’s more “honest and trustworthy,” Clinton tops him by fourteen points on “who understands the problems of people like you.” Bush isn’t alone in this deficiency. The whole Republican field is proudly, doggedly committed to a set of economic policies that reinforce the party’s identification with the already prosperous, and that has lost the popular vote in five out of the past six Presidential elections.","1351","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

"When Martin O’Malley, one of the back-running Democratic Presidential candidates, accused “party bosses” of fixing the nomination process, it was enough to bring on a wave of nostalgia. Party bosses! The concept is as distant as a time when there really were party bosses, people like Thomas Pendergast, whose machine ran Kansas City when Harry Truman was a senator (bosses often came with “machines”), or Chicago bosses like Edward Kelly, in the Roosevelt era, or Richard J. Daley, in the Eisenhower-Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon era. But, despite O’Malley’s complaint, it is hard to make a case that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman who heads the Democratic National Committee, is a boss or controls a machine, even if the debate schedule—four “authorized” debates before the Iowa caucuses, on February 1st, and just six in all—does skew suspiciously toward the already widely known Hillary Clinton.

Priebus can seem like the dad in an old-time situation comedy, the ineffectual, slightly comic figure who accidentally switches shopping lists with a shady neighbor. Priebus aside, the Republican Party may nonetheless have acquired a new sort of boss, or perhaps anti-boss—Fox News Channel’s Megyn Kelly, who is politically alert, unflinching, and, to judge from the evidence of recent years, attuned to reality. That’s what so annoyed the onetime “mastermind” Karl Rove when, on the night of the 2012 election, he refused to accept the arithmetic of the decisive Ohio vote. Kelly tried to help him with the math, and their curious dialogue continued two days later, when Rove insisted several times that Obama’s victory wasn’t all that impressive and Kelly said, “You keep saying that, but he won, Karl, he won … and that’s what the Republicans care about, what the Democrats care about.”","1354","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"

Rather, the beginning of the slow-motion end for Trump, if indeed it is the end, won’t have come from a private conversation among city bosses or a shove from Reince Priebus—or from the other Republican candidates, who are either ineffectual or have shied away.

Thomas Nast drew caricatures so devastating that they roiled the ample guts of our town’s Boss, William Marcy Tweed. Will Rogers’s homespun barbs humbled the devious of the early twentieth century. Mort Sahl, the Eisenhower-era comic whose prop was a rolled-up newspaper, used conventional one-liners to wage radical battle: “I’ve arranged with my executor to be buried in Chicago, because when I die I want to still remain politically active.” Later, Dick Gregory, Richard Pryor, and Joan Rivers continued to draw comic sustenance from what Philip Roth called “the indigenous American berserk.”","1362","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"Four nights a week for sixteen years, Jon Stewart, the host and impresario of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” has taken to the air to expose our civic bizarreries. He has been heroic and persistent. Blasted into orbit by a trumped-up (if you will) impeachment and a stolen Presidential election, and then rocketing through the war in Iraq and right up to the current electoral circus, with its commodious clown car teeming with would-be Commanders-in-Chief, Stewart has lasered away the layers of hypocrisy in politics and in the media. On any given night, a quick montage of absurdist video clips culled from cable or network news followed by Stewart’s vaudeville reactions can be ten times as deflating to the self-regard of the powerful as any solemn editorial—and twice as illuminating as the purportedly non-fake news that provides his fuel.","1363","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"Stewart grew up in New Jersey. He was schooled at William & Mary, in Virginia. Adrift for a while, he took odd jobs. He tested mosquitoes from the Pine Barrens for encephalitis. He put on puppet shows for disabled children. At the Bitter End and other clubs around the city, he studied all the varieties of standup. He proved especially fluent in a meta-Borscht Belt post-Friars Club rhythm. As a performer, Stewart is nearly as connected to Molly Picon and Professor Irwin Corey as he is to George Carlin.","1364","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"On January 11, 1999, he made his début as “The Daily Show’s” host, replacing a less political wisenheimer named Craig Kilborn. Initially, Stewart seemed ill at ease with the trappings of his position. He wore a suit that first night, and, in the midst of an interview with the actor Michael J. Fox, he blurted, “Honestly, I feel like this is my bar mitzvah. I’ve never worn something like this, and I have a rash like you wouldn’t believe.” The evening was rounded out by a report on the Clinton impeachment hearings by Stewart’s “chief political correspondent,” a young improv comic named Stephen Colbert.","1365","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"Stewart soon found his footing, and what he became, with the help of his writers, his co-stars, and a tirelessly acute research team, was the best seriocomic reader of the press since A. J. Liebling laid waste to media barons like William Randolph Hearst and Colonel Robert R. McCormick. Stewart demonstrated that many of the tropes favored by the yellow press of Liebling’s day have only grown stronger. “There is no concept more generally cherished by publishers than that of the Undeserving Poor,” Liebling wrote. The contempt that he found in the plutocrat-owned, proletarian-read press, Stewart found on Fox News—particularly in ersatz journalists like Stuart Varney, a sneery character out of Dickens who regularly goes on about “these so-called poor people” who “have things” but “what they lack is the richness of spirit.” Stewart’s evisceration of Varney was typically swift and unforgiving. Perhaps his greatest single performance came in 2010, with a fifteen-minute-long bravura parody of the huckster and conspiracy theorist Glenn Beck.","1366","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"There was always something a little disingenuous about Stewart’s insistence that he is a centrist, free of ideological commitment to anything except truth and sanity. In fact, his politics tend to lean left of center. He’s been aggressive toward, and ruthlessly funny about, unsurprising targets from Donald Rumsfeld to Wall Street. His support for L.G.B.T. rights, civil rights, voting rights, and women’s rights has always been unambiguous. His critique of Obama is generally that of the somewhat disappointed liberal, particularly on issues like Guantánamo and drones. But Stewart is a centrist only in this sense: he is not so much pro-left as he is anti-bullshit.","1367","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"At the same time, he has occasionally dropped the nightly gagfest to reveal flashes of earnest anger and unironic heart. Just after 9/11, he began his program with a personal monologue: “The view from my apartment was the World Trade Center. And now it’s gone. And they attacked it, this symbol of American ingenuity and strength, and labor and imagination and commerce, and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? The Statue of Liberty. The view from the south of Manhattan is now the Statue of Liberty. You can’t beat that.” More recently, after a grand jury on Staten Island failed to bring any charges related to the death of Eric Garner, an African-American whose crime was the sale of loose cigarettes, Stewart declared himself dumbstruck. “I honestly don’t know what to say,” he told his audience. “If comedy is tragedy plus time, I need more [bleep]ing time. But I would really settle for less [bleep]ing tragedy.” Similarly, after this year’s mass murder in Charleston, Stewart said, “I honestly have nothing other than just sadness, once again, that we have to peer into the abyss of the depraved violence that we do to each other and the nexus of a just gaping racial wound that will not heal yet we pretend doesn’t exist.”","1368","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"Stewart set out to be a working comedian, and he ended up an invaluable patriot. But the berserk never stops. His successor, Trevor Noah, will not lack for material. As Stewart put it wryly on one of his last nights on the air, “As I wind down my time here, I leave this show knowing that most of the world’s problems have been solved by us, ‘The Daily Show.’ But sadly there are still some dark corners that our broom of justice has not reached yet.” ♦","1369","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/exit-stage-left"
"If you’re following the 2016 Presidential campaign closely (and, at this early stage, I’m not suggesting that’s necessary), you’ll find an interesting subplot. While much of the media is focussing on the rise of Donald Trump and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders, the two pre-race favorites, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, are continuing to focus on each other. At the start of this week, the Clinton campaign put out a video highlighting what it said were Bush’s “extreme ideas about immigration” and claiming that he was following Trump’s lead. On Thursday, the Bush campaign released a video highlighting Clinton’s e-mail travails and promoting Bush’s upcoming e-book, ”Reply All,” which will contain some of the e-mail exchanges he had when he was the governor of Florida.","August 27, 2015","1370","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"It’s pretty clear what’s going on here. The seasoned operatives running both campaigns are operating on the assumption that, six or seven months from now, Jeb and Hillary will both be on their way to securing the nominations of their respective parties, after which they will face each other in a general election. The Trump tornado will have blown itself out. Sanders will have maxed out his support among progressive Democrats. Order will have been restored, and it will be Bush versus Clinton, after all.","1371","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"On the Democratic side, arguably, this strategy of playing a long game makes sense. Clinton, despite recent slippages—notably in New Hampshire, where two successive surveys have shown Sanders ahead of her—retains a big lead in the national polls. For example, a Quinnipiac University survey of likely Democratic voters released on Thursday showed Clinton at forty-five per cent and Sanders at twenty-two per cent.","1372","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As my colleague Ryan Lizza pointed out in a post arguing that Vice-President Joe Biden can’t win the nomination, Clinton also has the support of a majority of elected Democrats, which, in the past, has been a good predictor of success. I’m a bit less convinced than Ryan that a Biden campaign would be a no-hoper. In the Quinnipiac poll, he came in third, at eighteen per cent—not bad for someone who isn’t even a candidate yet. But there is no doubt that, right now, Clinton is the strong favorite. Most British bookmakers, where people wager real money on these things, have the odds of her getting the nomination at one to three or one to four. This implies that bettors put the probability that Clinton will prevail at seventy-five or eighty per cent.","1373","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Bush’s campaign, on the other hand, appears to be in free fall. His poll numbers are tanking, his message is blurred, his verbal stumbles are multiplying, and his money men are reportedly getting nervous. In the betting market, he remains the favorite to get the G.O.P. nomination, but at some of the sites his odds have slipped to seven to four, which implies that the probability of his winning is about a third. Rather than worrying about Clinton, Bush and his strategists desperately need to find a way for him to counter his Republican rivals—not just Trump, whose whirlwind campaign would be difficult for any regular politician to deal with, but Marco Rubio, John Kasich, and Carly Fiorina, any of whom could conceivably end up supplanting him as the moderate conservative candidate. (I use “moderate” in a relative sense. All of the G.O.P. candidates, Bush included, are solidly on the right.)","1374","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Until Memorial Day, when Trump wasn’t yet in the race, Bush was polling in the mid-teens—enough to keep him in or close to the lead. The new Quinnipiac poll has him at seven per cent, sharing third place with Rubio and Cruz. That’s just one survey, of course, but the Real Clear Politics poll average also shows him dropping into single figures, at 9.8 per cent. And it’s not just the national polls that are bringing bad tidings. In Iowa, Bush is tied, with Rubio, for sixth place—yes, sixth—behind Trump, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, and Fiorina. In New Hampshire, he is in third place: Kasich, who is making a big effort there, has moved ahead of him (with both of them well behind Trump). In South Carolina, too, Bush is in third place, behind Trump and Carson. Based on these numbers, it appears that he could fail to win any of the first three primaries, leaving him acutely vulnerable going into the Nevada caucus and Super Tuesday.","1375","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Of course, these numbers will change over the next few months. But they are unlikely to move in Bush’s favor unless he hones his message and stops tripping over himself. What does he stand for? Going into the campaign, it seemed pretty straightforward: competence, conservative economics, and a shift toward the center on immigration and other social issues. But in none of these areas has he really delivered. His verbal clangers have made him look like a gentleman amateur, rather than a seasoned politician capable of taking down a Clinton or a Biden. Beyond some sunny rhetoric about boosting the G.D.P. growth rate to four per cent a year, his economic plan remains largely undefined.","1376","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Perhaps most alarming of all, Bush seems unsure whether he truly represents a break with the xenophobic, homophobic, modernity-loathing wing of the Republican Party. He has allowed Kasich, in particular, to position himself as a plausible, electable alternative. (One telling example: while Bush is running away from the Common Core education standards, which he previously backed, and which many conservative Republican activists hate, Kasich is still supporting them.)","1377","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Meanwhile, the gaffes keep coming. Every week, it seems, Bush or a member of his staff has to try to walk back one of his public comments. Most recently, he suggested, after using the term “anchor babies,” that he was referring not to children born in the United States to Hispanic parents but to those born to Asian parents. That hop from the frying pan into the fire allowed Trump, of all people, to accuse him of being offensive. And it’s not merely that Bush appears to have inherited the family weakness for malapropisms. He seems incapable of saying anything snappy or memorable. With Trump regularly tearing him to shreds in interviews and on Twitter, the best he can manage in response are statements like “Mr. Trump doesn’t have a proven conservative record.”","1378","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As long as Trump’s campaign seemed likely to fade quickly, staying above the fray was a defensible strategy. It jibed with the old edict “Never wrestle with a pig. You get dirty and, besides, the pig likes it.” But things have moved on, and it’s clear that Trump isn’t going away anytime soon. Moreover, Trump is a typical bully, and so, as long as he senses weakness on Bush’s part, he will continue to torment him with comments like “Jeb Bush is a low-energy person,” or, as he put it in Alabama last weekend, “a very, very low-energy person.”","1379","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"

"But wait, you may ask, hasn’t Bush already tried that? He has. On Monday, he went to Texas to denounce Trump’s heartless and impractical immigration plan.

A recent CNN/ORC poll found him tied with Ted Cruz for fifth place in the field, with support from only six per cent of those polled, behind Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio.

Ron Paul toured the country, telling Republican voters things you might think they wouldn’t want to hear. In the 2012 primary, he finished in second place, behind Mitt Romney, in New Hampshire, with 22.8 per cent of the vote. Four years later, one poll has Ron Paul’s less recalcitrant son at only four per cent. The Web site FiveThirtyEight points out that, nationwide, Rand Paul’s support is currently lower than his father’s was at this point in 2012.","1383","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"What went wrong? There is no shortage of explanations, partly because contemporary politics has no shortage of professional explainers. The Politico story claimed that Paul is “allergic” to buttering up big donors, and suggested that his campaign is chaotic. (It included a particularly vivid anecdote about a near-physical altercation between Paul’s campaign manager and a member of his security staff, who was described as a “a 280-pound retired New York police detective and Paul family loyalist.”) Paul himself told a reporter for the Boston Globe that one of the obstacles he faced was a crowded Republican field. “Obviously, everybody’s numbers come down when you divide it many different ways,” he said.","1384","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"None of this quite explains Paul’s collapse, especially considering that some polls from last summer put him in the lead. Writing in this magazine last year, Ryan Lizza traced Paul’s incomplete journey from an idea-driven libertarian—he once supported the legalization of all drugs, and argued that a free society should tolerate “unofficial, private discrimination”—to an elected politician more willing to consider the exigencies of party loyalty. After Mitt Romney lost to Obama in 2012, many voices in the Republican Party were calling for a change, and the official G.O.P. post-election report warned that “public perception of the Party is at record lows.” This seemed like an opening for a nonconformist such as Paul.","1385","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"In 2012, Paul opposed the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a government corporation that loans money to foreign customers of U.S. companies. He said it was absurd for the government to borrow money from overseas while also loaning money to foreign companies, and he was one of twenty Senators who voted against its reauthorization. Since then, the anti-Ex-Im movement has grown, and what was once considered a fringe movement celebrated a triumph when the Bank’s charter expired on the last day of June this year. Then, this past Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved to revive the Bank, angering many of his fellow Republicans. Senator Ted Cruz, another Presidential candidate, accused McConnell of having told a “flat-out lie” by denying, at a lunch meeting, that he had a secret plan to revive the Ex-Im Bank. Cruz, canny as always, probably calculated that his blunt language would get him plenty of press, and he was right. (The effort to revive the bank seems to have failed.)","1386","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Paul, by contrast, has forged a strategic relationship with McConnell, who also happens to be Kentucky’s other Senator, and his eagerness to argue against the Ex-Im Bank suddenly seemed to have cooled. Late on Friday afternoon, during a radio interview, Sean Hannity asked Paul about Cruz’s claims. “I wasn’t at that lunch,” Paul said, executing a rather inelegant pivot. “But what I can tell you is that there’s a disconnect—conservatives want to vote on defunding Planned Parenthood.” Paul often wants to talk about defunding Planned Parenthood, these days, and while primary voters surely agree with his position, it doesn’t much distinguish him from the rest of his Republican competitors. (Bush, Rubio, and Walker also support defunding.)","1387","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"So what makes Paul stand out? For a time, one of his signature issues was opposition to the National Security Agency’s bulk data-collection practices, but the issue grew muddier in June, with the passage of the USA Freedom Act, which ruled that data would be collected by telecommunications companies, instead of by the government; Paul considered this a very partial victory, and he delivered a long and equivocal speech expressing his mixed feelings. Paul’s interest in criminal-justice reform once marked him as an unorthodox Republican, but an increasing number of Republicans are now talking about changing the way we fight crime. On national security, Paul used to be skeptical about the need to confront regimes deemed hostile—last fall, he parted company with many Republicans by calling for “an effective diplomatic solution for limiting the Iranian enrichment program.” But when the Obama Administration announced its nuclear deal with Iran, Paul joined his Republican rivals in calling it “unacceptable.” Finally, Paul has failed to establish himself as the candidate of Silicon Valley, which is often described as a libertarian-friendly community. The Politico story explained how Paul has failed, so far, to cultivate fruitful relationships there. And when Hillary Clinton suggested we ask “hard questions” about the “gig economy” typified by companies such as Uber, Paul responded with acerbic tweets—only to be upstaged by Bush, a few days later, who used Uber to visit a start-up in San Francisco.","1388","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Some of the people who should be most enthusiastic about Paul’s Presidential campaign have found themselves disheartened by it. Last week, Nick Gillespie, the editor-in-chief of the libertarian site reason.com, laid out the many un-libertarian things Paul has done and said. He called his campaign “doubly frustrating”—that is, neither principled nor successful. Maybe Paul would always have struggled to win over Republican primary voters. And maybe, during the gruelling months to come, he will rebound and, like a number of candidates in 2012, have a moment near the front of the pack.","1389","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"But whatever happens, potential supporters like Gillespie shouldn’t be so disappointed. Even as his campaign struggles, many of his issues are doing surprisingly well—in fact, that’s a big part of the reason why Paul has struggled to define himself. The formerly indomitable Ex-Im bank has been vanquished, though perhaps it will return in another form; the N.S.A. has been reformed, though lightly; a “diplomatic solution” seems imminent in Iran, though of course people disagree about its effectiveness; criminal-justice reform has bipartisan momentum, though it may yet meet with resistance; politicians wishing to hamper companies like Uber are meeting stiff resistance, though they will keep trying. These are all tentative, partial, and temporary victories—but then, politics rarely offers any other kind. Rand Paul is struggling in the polls, but Paulism looks pretty healthy. That’s not good news for the Presidential candidate, but it’s also not such bad news for the guy who may still be, come 2017, a Senator from Kentucky.","1390","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"

On Thursday, it will be the turn of George Pataki, the former governor of New York. Who knows whom Friday will bring? Lindsey Graham? Rick Perry? Donald Trump? Herman (999) Cain? Ted Nugent?","1398","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Here, in alphabetical order, are the eight Republican candidates who, by Thursday, will be officially running: Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Pataki, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Santorum. Then there are Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, two front-runners who have all but announced that they are in. Currently in the “exploratory” stage, we have Graham, Trump, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, and the benighted Chris Christie. That makes fifteen, with other outlying possibilities, too.","1399","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"The number turns out to be too high for Roger Ailes, Hannity’s boss at Fox News. The network (along with Facebook) is set to host the first televised G.O.P. debate, in Cleveland, on August 6th, and it has said that it intends to limit participation to the top ten candidates in the polls, plus those who are tied. “It was a difficult call based on political necessity,” Howard Kurtz, the veteran media reporter, who now works for Fox, explained in a post on Tuesday. “With 17 or 18 Republicans gearing up to run, you simply can’t have a viable debate with all of them. Each candidate would receive a miniscule amount of time. No sustained questioning would be possible. And it would be bad television.”","1400","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Not everyone associated with the Republican Party is happy about Fox’s decision. Appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Wednesday, Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, accused Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, of colluding with Fox to cull the field prematurely. “There are fourteen candidates who are serious people,” Kristol said (doubtless prompting a protest call from Trump). “I think they all deserve to be on the stage.” He proposed that they have two debates, with the candidates split up randomly. “Republicans would be interested. They wouldn’t turn off the TV halfway through.”","1401","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Kristol raises a good point. If Fox applied its proposed criteria on the basis of current polling data collated by Real Clear Politics, Santorum, who won eleven state primaries in 2012, would barely make the cut. Fiorina, the only female candidate, who has reportedly impressed Republican audiences in Iowa and New Hampshire, would miss out. So would Graham, Jindal, and Kasich, all experienced elected officials. That doesn’t seem fair, or even particularly democratic. So what to do?","1402","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"The G.O.P. needs a procedure that affords all of the candidates an opportunity to impress while also acknowledging that voters (and viewers) can’t be expected to take all fifteen or twenty candidates seriously. One solution might be to turn the early stages of the G.O.P. primary into a version of “Survivor,” the long-running reality-television series.","1403","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"Here’s how it could work. Following Kristol’s suggestion, Fox and Facebook would hold two debates on August 6th, with the candidates drawing lots to decide whether they appeared on the first or the second one. Each would receive the same amount of airtime, and the questions in the two debates would be broadly similar.","1404","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"For the second debate, which CNN is scheduled to host from the Reagan Library, in Simi Valley, on September 16th, things would be different. A limit of twelve candidates would be imposed. Rather than follow the “Survivor” template literally, and have the candidates themselves decide who gets to appear at the debate and who doesn’t, it would be best to rely on surveys of likely Republican voters. The top dozen candidates in the poll of polls on September 9th, a week before the debate, would make the cut; everybody else would miss out. I’d leave it to the network executives and the R.N.C. to decide whether this debate would need to be split in two, like the first one. (CNN has suggested an alternative format for its event, using the full slate of candidates, in which the top ten candidates appear in one debate and the rest in another.)","1405","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"The winnowing process wouldn’t end there. For the third debate, which will take place in October, there would be another cut, to ten candidates, with the poll of polls again deciding who is invited. And for the fourth debate, in November, there would be a final cut, to eight candidates.","1406","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"By that stage, the G.O.P.’s Iowa caucus would be on the horizon—it’s now slated for February 2nd, but may well move up a bit—and the field might be starting to narrow of its own accord, regardless. But for now, and for the next few months, there are too many candidates, and some way of treating them equitably needs to be found.","1407","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"
"My solution perhaps isn’t the best. Quite probably, it would favor candidates who have raised enough money to launch advertising campaigns and boost their poll numbers—but the current system does that anyway. Another possible objection is that focussing attention on the minor players would blur the message of the front-runners. I doubt that would happen. Bush, Rubio, and Walker would still get the bulk of the media’s attention.","1408","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republican-survivor-a-proposal-for-culling-the-g-o-p-field"

"Days before Donald Trump helped draw twenty-four million viewers to Fox for the first Republican Presidential primary debate, Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, took to YouTube for a new-media gambit. Broadcasting from a drab Washington, D.C., apartment, the Brooklyn-bred Democratic candidate delivered a fifteen-minute speech, which was screened for a hundred thousand fans at gatherings around the country. Among the venues registered on the Sanders Web site: “a GMO-free restaurant in the same parking lot as Sapphires Strip Club” (Las Vegas, Nevada), “My Home in the Woods” (Burton, Ohio), and the “Schatsky Family Household” (New York, New York).","1410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/enter-sandman"

The apartment, according to an article called “Teach Your Parents Well,” in Dwell, had been eco-fitted at the behest of Ronen and his sister, when they were eight and five. “I just said they should do a sustainable apartment, and they hired an architect,” said Ronen, who will attend the University of Chicago, after a gap year spent farming in Europe and hiking the Appalachian Trail.","1411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/enter-sandman"

"In his opening monologue for “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart, referring to the murder of nine congregants in their own church by a twenty-one-year-old young man who’d spent nearly an hour in their prayerful company before shooting them, said, “I didn’t do my job today. So I apologize. I’ve got nothing for you, in terms of jokes and sounds, because of what happened in South Carolina.” He’d been scribbling furiously on a piece of paper on the desk in front of him, looking away from the audience. “And maybe if I wasn’t nearing the end of the run, or this wasn’t such a common occurrence, maybe I could have pulled out of the spiral. But I didn’t. And so I honestly have nothing.”","1427","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/jon-stewarts-charleston-despair"
"Stewart is in the midst of his final month and a half on the air, and, just this week he expressed his delight at Donald Trump’s entry into the Presidential race by quipping, “A billionaire vanity candidate taking an escalator to the White House!,” before thanking Trump “for making my last six weeks my best six weeks.” The monologue matched his funniest and most exuberant ever, with Stewart using his full bag of tricks—putting on accents, mugging for the camera, his hands flying around in front of him. The laughter was supercharged by the reminder that this kind of thing was now finite, and someone else would have to get us through Election Day. The segment ended with Stewart, a giddy lame duck, faking an extended orgasm.","1428","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/jon-stewarts-charleston-despair"
"But, on Thursday night, Stewart sounded tired and despairing, as if coming to terms with the fact that the nation’s most poisonous problems would outlast his ability to mock or rage against them. That he would go and they might win. “We have to peer into the abyss of the depraved violence that we do to each other and the nexus of a gaping racial wound that will not heal yet we pretend doesn’t exist,” he said. It seemed for a moment that Stewart, who once hosted a rally in Washington to restore sanity and open-minded discourse to politics, would steer his audience toward some hopeful moment of zen. “I’m confident though, that by acknowledging it, by staring into that, and seeing it for what it is”—but then he paused for a few beats—“we still won’t do jackshit. Yeah, that’s us.”","1429","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/jon-stewarts-charleston-despair"
"Stewart’s monologue was, in several ways, a darker cousin to the remarks that President Obama had made during a press conference earlier in the day. “I’ve had to make statements like this too many times,” he said. He was talking about gun violence, and mass shootings, and how, compared to other ostensibly advanced nations, the United States was uniquely afflicted by this epidemic. Nine people dead, the shooter using a .45-calibre handgun that he’d reportedly been given by his father for his birthday. That’s us.","1430","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/jon-stewarts-charleston-despair"
"“And it is in our power to do something about it,” Obama continued. “I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now. But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it. And at some point it’s going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it, and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively.”","1431","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/jon-stewarts-charleston-despair"
"This wasn’t like after Sandy Hook; you didn’t get the sense that the President was poised in the coming days to announce any new gun-control initiatives that would inevitably be swallowed up into the congressional maw, where, as Stewart and not the President might say, they’d do “jackshit” about it. This time, the President sounded angry and frustrated in much the same way that a private citizen might, at a loss to suggest a way forward. Before there might be legislation, the country would need to clear another, far more basic hurdle: simple acknowledgement that a problem—of gun violence, of racism—exists at all. But, like Stewart, Obama is nearing the end of his run, and his remarks, though they incorporated the oratory of Martin Luther King, Jr., and pointed toward a future of hope and peace, sounded almost resigned. He seemed to suggest that the country’s reckoning would have to happen without him.","1432","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/jon-stewarts-charleston-despair"
"Hillary Clinton’s big speech about the economy on Monday generated a wide range of reactions from the punditocracy. The Times’s David Brooks thought it was politically clever: “She’s cleared the first political hurdle of the campaign,” he wrote. Vox’s Matthew Yglesias said that Clinton’s policy agenda amounted to a rebuke of neoliberalism and indicated a “paleoliberal revival.” Politico’s Ben White reckoned that the speech was a non-event. “The snap reaction among Wall Street investors, economists and ardent financial reformers who thrill to the soak-the-rich rhetoric of Bernie Sanders was a collective: ‘Meh. What’s next?’ ” he reported.","July 14, 2015","1433","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"My reaction was that the speech suggested serious intentions to tackle the problem of wage stagnation and to boost middle-class incomes (“That will be my mission from the first day I’m President to the last,” Clinton said), while still seeking to hold the center ground of today’s Democratic Party, which has shifted to the left since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in 2008, and the later rise of Occupy Wall Street. Compared to the starry-eyed supply-side revivalism of Jeb Bush and the relentless labor-bashing of Scott Walker, though, her speech was on a different plane completely.","1434","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"In terms of policy details, it was pretty much as expected. Many of the proposals that Clinton outlined were part of a lengthy report on “inclusive prosperity” that was published, earlier this year, by the Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta, her campaign manager. The C.A.P.’s panel of experts, led by Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, and Ed Balls, the Labour Party’s top spokesman on economic issues, proposed boosting the minimum wage, investing in child care and education, setting up an infrastructure bank, changing the tax code to eliminate loopholes enjoyed by the rich, expanding tax breaks for profit-sharing and employee share ownership, and strengthening collective bargaining.","1435","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clinton proposed all of these things. She also embraced President Obama’s recent move to expand overtime pay, called for more paid sick days and family leave, and promised to prosecute individuals and firms on Wall Street. (On my Twitter stream, that last pledge sparked some skepticism. One person sent me a link to an OpenSecrets.org page showing that three of Clinton’s top four campaign donors, in the course of her career, are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase.)","1436","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"One thing Clinton didn’t do was utter the “R-word”—redistribution—which would surely be a central element of any serious revival of old-fashioned American liberalism. Instead, she talked about encouraging “fair growth,” which is another term for inclusive prosperity. Speaking on this theme, she said, for example, “We have to get serious about supporting workers,” and, referring to the need for tax reform, “Those at the top have to pay their fair share.”","1437","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clinton didn’t spell out how she’d revive labor unions, which now represent less than seven per cent of workers in the private sector. The only specific tax changes she proposed that would affect the very rich were eliminating the carried-interest deduction enjoyed by hedge-fund managers and private-equity managers, and enacting the “Buffett rule,” which would apply a minimum federal tax rate of thirty per cent to people earning more than a million dollars a year. These are two eminently worthwhile proposals, ones that President Obama has also endorsed. By themselves, however, they wouldn’t do very much to address the remarkable concentration of income and wealth at the very top of the income distribution.","1438","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"To be fair to Clinton, nobody is quite sure how to tackle that problem. At the very least, it would require a three-pronged approach: far-reaching changes to the tax code aimed at taxing wealth and restoring the progressivity that was part of the code until Ronald Reagan came to power; reining in the financial sector, which is responsible for much of the rise in inequality over the past thirty years; and challenging the social norms and corporate-governance structures that facilitate the outlandish pay packages received by senior corporate executives.","1439","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clearly, Clinton isn’t willing to go that far, although she did say that she’d get back to us with some proposals to encourage long-term investing over short-term trading. “The speech revealed a woman who does not have her heart in class conflict,” Brooks rightly noted. Like many centrist Democrats, she prefers to talk about expanding opportunity while proposing individual measures with a redistributive aspect, such as providing child care for working mothers and expanding financial aid for students from modest backgrounds. Over the past twenty-five years, this pragmatic approach has produced some major advances for Americans of modest means, such as the repeated expansion of earned-income-tax credits and the Affordable Care Act.","1440","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"It is an eminently defensible philosophy, and Brooks may also be right when he argues that it’s more politically palatable to the American public at large than the fire-and-brimstone stuff that Clinton’s competitor Bernie Sanders is offering up. You have to wonder, though. Over the holiday weekend, I ran into a retired businessman who used to own a firm that employed more than a hundred people. I’ve never been an extremist of any sort, he said, but I’ve come to the conclusion that America, at this stage, would benefit from a modest dose of socialism.","1441","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"

"According to the poll, there is widespread fear that, if the debate were to be viewed in foreign countries, the cost to the United States’ prestige around the world would be incalculable.","1445","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/nation-worried-that-rest-of-world-might-see-debate"
"On a more personal level, many expressed concern that any international broadcast of the debate would greatly diminish their desire to ever travel abroad or talk to foreigners.","1446","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/nation-worried-that-rest-of-world-might-see-debate"
"In another measure of Americans’ discomfort with Thursday’s televised event, two of the TV programs they identified as being the biggest embarrassments to America, “Duck Dynasty” and “Jersey Shore,” still lagged far behind the debate.","1447","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/nation-worried-that-rest-of-world-might-see-debate"
"Those surveyed strongly agreed that the U.S. government should block the foreign transmission of the debate, or that Fox News should air an explanation of the contest beforehand, but they were at a loss as to what that explanation could possibly be.","1448","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/nation-worried-that-rest-of-world-might-see-debate"

"As you may have heard, two more candidates have entered the G.O.P. primary contest: Ben Carson, the famous neurosurgeon from Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, who turned to conservative politics a few years ago, and Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. And Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, who ran for the Republican nomination in 2008, is expected to announce his candidacy on Tuesday.","May 5, 2015","1453","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"With Huckabee in, there will be six confirmed candidates. The other three are all senators: Ted Cruz (Texas), Rand Paul (Kentucky), and Marco Rubio (Florida). Then there are Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, who are both busy raising money and making what amount to campaign speeches, but who have yet to make their candidacies official. Beyond these eight lie a host of maybes, wannabes, and long shots. They include the former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum and the former Texas governor Rick Perry, both of whom lost to Mitt Romney in 2012; John Kasich, the governor of Ohio; Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana; Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina; Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey; and Donald Trump, the governor of Trump Tower and a bunch of upscale golf resorts.","1454","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"

"If your head is spinning, join the club. Nobody should be expected, or forced, to keep up with every detail of the G.O.P. primary, especially when, Lord help us, we still have more than eight months to go until the Iowa caucuses. At this stage, the important thing to remember is that there are really two spectacles taking place: a high-stakes horse race for the Republican nomination, and a circus held on the infield of the track. Although the events run concurrently, and are ostensibly geared toward the same end, they shouldn’t be confused with one another. One is a serious political contest. The other is a sideshow, designed to amuse the spectators, give the media something to cover, and further the ambitions, varied as they are, of the participants.","1456","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Ostensibly, the G.O.P. field looks confusing and wide open. In many polls, nobody gets the support of even twenty per cent of potential Republican voters. But if you allow for some variability from survey to survey, a distinctive pattern has emerged. The Real Clear Politics poll of polls, which combines data from many individual polls, shows that Bush has been in the lead for most of the past six months, and that he’s still ahead, with a polling average of 15.5 per cent. Rubio has been gaining ground since he announced his candidacy three weeks ago, and is now in second place, at 14.3 per cent. Walker, who enjoyed a surge earlier this year, is now in third place, with 12.8 per cent.","1457","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the horse race is settling down, with Bush as the front runner, Walker and Rubio tucked in behind, and Paul and Cruz further back. A new survey, by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, confirms this picture—indeed, it suggests that the front runners may be pulling a bit further ahead. The poll showed Bush at twenty-three per cent, Rubio at eighteen per cent, and Walker at fourteen per cent. Paul and Cruz were both at eleven per cent.*","1458","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Huckabee could yet emerge as a sixth serious contender. A fixture on conservative television and radio, the Arkansan will pick up votes from evangelical Christians, although it’s hard to see him expanding much beyond that demographic. The rest in the field look as though they are destined for the circus. Of course, one of them could still burst through the rails and join the front-runners, as Herman Cain did for a time in 2011. But the polls, the money, and the political topography are against them.","1459","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"The ultra-conservative end of the field is already crowded, with Walker, Paul, and Cruz competing against each other, and Huckabee and Carson about to join them. Carson, an African-American who grew up in a poor family in Detroit, has a compelling personal story to tell, and his message of small government and self-reliance goes over well with many Republicans. But the long buildup to his campaign launch has been marked by a series of inflammatory statements, including one, while he was discussing same-sex marriage, in 2013, in which he equated gays with members of NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association. (He later apologized.) And in March of this year, he said that being gay is a choice, and added, “A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they’re gay.’ ” It’s not clear whether Carson has been deliberately outrageous in order to attract the attention of right-wing talk-show hosts, or whether he is just gaffe-prone. In either case, he is looking increasingly like a fringe candidate.","1460","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"The moderate-conservative end of the G.O.P. field has a bit more space open than the conservative end. With Chris Christie’s candidacy snarled up in the Fort Lee traffic, Bush and Rubio are the two leading contenders in this part of the spectrum—although, as I’ve noted before, it’s far from clear that either of them deserves to be called a moderate. Potentially, there is room for an avowedly non-ideological candidate who can reach across party lines, and Fiorina may be aiming to occupy it. Since entering politics, she has adopted conservative positions on issues such as climate change, same-sex marriage, and eliminating the estate tax. In the campaign video announcing her candidacy on Monday, however, she didn’t focus on any of these things. Instead, she attacked Hillary Clinton, but also, by extension, many of her Republican rivals, saying, “Our founders never intended us to have a professional political class…. If you’re tired of the sound bites, the vitriol, the pettiness, the egos, the corruption… then join us.”","1461","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"As the only woman likely to enter the G.O.P. field, and a possible foil for Clinton, Fiorina is guaranteed to receive some media attention. Her challenge is that many people don’t think she has much of a record to run on. If this were 1998, when she was a senior executive at Lucent Technologies, and Fortune magazine named her as the most powerful women in business, she would be in better shape. However, her tenure as Hewlett-Packard’s C.E.O., from 1999 to 2005, was widely criticized, and ended with the board of directors forcing her out (albeit with the consolation of a twenty-million-dollar golden parachute). In 2010, she ran for the U.S. Senate in California, and Barbara Boxer beat her handily. During the campaign, the Los Angeles Times reported that Fiorina hadn’t voted in numerous elections. She apologized, saying, “Shame on me.”","1462","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Currently, Fiorina is running dead last in the G.O.P. polls, but she was visited New Hampshire on Monday, attending a luncheon with local lawmakers and pressing the flesh. In the early stages of Presidential races, hope springs eternal. And even if things don’t work out for her campaign, it will probably help her sell some books. As it happens, she’s got a new one that is being released on Tuesday: “Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey.”","1463","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"

"The life of a working actor is one of endless degradations. Sure, the glamorous aspects are glamorous, but for most people they’re wedged among rejection, instability, and odd jobs—witness the actors reportedly paid to play Donald Trump supporters at his campaign announcement last week. Michael Tyburski and Ben Nabors’s short film “Actor Seeks Role,” the latest in our Screening Room series, captures some of the humiliation, underscored by real peril. The opening scene contains a small surprise (no spoilers—watch it now, without reading further, if you haven’t), but it’s based on a real thing that actors do for cash. When they wrote the film, Nabors’s wife was a medical student at Cornell, and she would tell him stories about “standardized patients,” or medical actors. Paul, the actor played by Alex Karpovsky, appears to be talented at what he does, but that makes his grim quality of life only more depressing. From the framed pictures around his apartment, he wants to be a serious actor—but the city is full of would-be Brandos, and the ratio of people to parts is unsparing.","June 22, 2015","1481","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-screening-room-actor-seeks-role"
"Tyburski and Nabors, who have collaborated on three short films (their first, “Palimpsest,” premièred at Sundance, in 2013), wanted to explore the overlaps between acting and medicine. “Hospitals have rooms called things like ‘medical theatres,’ and there are, of course, curtains around a patient’s bed,” Tyburski said. “In my romanticized version of how medical acting works from the performer’s perspective, I like to think that this is essentially still a sort of stage for the actor. It might not be the big Broadway début that they originally envisioned, but it’s all still performance, complete with a curtain and all. At the end of our story, our main character has essentially found his ‘stage’ and ‘audience,’ but it’s not quite how he imagined it.”","1482","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-screening-room-actor-seeks-role"
"You likely know Karpovsky as Ray from “Girls” (he’s also an indie-film director), but Tyburski became aware of him from a Talk of the Town piece by Tad Friend, who wrote that the actor “shows promise of becoming his generation’s Woody Allen, a deadpan noticer of indignity.” Perfect! It turned out Tyburski and Karpovsky both live in Greenpoint, and they scheduled the shoot around “Girls.”","1483","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-screening-room-actor-seeks-role"
"So how do Karpovsky’s experiences stack up against Paul’s? He’s also done gigs that count as “acting” only if you squint. In his twenties, he worked at a travelling carnival, where he got his first taste of typecasting. “They divide you into rides and games,” he recalled. “As soon as you walk in, they suss you out based on how you look. If you seem like a slimy type of guy, you’re a gamer. If you’re a meathead muscle jock, you’re a rider. I’m kind of skinny so they made me games, but I didn’t like it very much, so I switched to rides. I ended up doing the Tilt-A-Whirl, a.k.a. the Spinning Teacups. I would take the tickets and help people get on and off.”","1484","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-screening-room-actor-seeks-role"
"He continued, “Another weird job was during the Internet boom. A lot of weird companies had money. There was one called Rumpus Toys—they made Teddy bears. My friend Andy and I dressed up as life-size versions of the Teddy bears, and would go to stores like Sam’s Club and dance around the display area that we’d rent for the day. We’d drive from store to store in the Rumpus Road Rocket, which was a yellow school bus. They gutted out all the seats and made it into a lounge. It kind of made no sense.”","1485","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-screening-room-actor-seeks-role"
"In his pre-“Girls” life, he had some random day jobs, too. He was a caterer. He worked for five years as a karaoke-video editor—you know, the videos of people running on the beach and riding in rowboats that have nothing to do with the songs you’re singing. “I’ve edited hundreds upon hundreds of karaoke videos,” he said. “You may have seen my work without knowing it. I tried to assemble it in some kind of narrative. I didn’t go to film school, and it was an incredibly educational experience for me. I actually made my first three movies through their office.”","1486","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-screening-room-actor-seeks-role"
"Olga Flores, the seventh of eleven siblings, was born in a small town in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo thirty-nine years ago. “There was no work,” she told me recently. “The only thing for a woman to do was to get married, have children, and cook for her whole life.” A job in a nearby city would have required a high-school certificate, but her education ended in middle school. So in January of 1998, when she was twenty-one, Flores arranged to come to the United States illegally. She took her first trip on an airplane, to northern Mexico, and made her way to Sonoyta, a town on the Arizona border.","1487","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"One of her brothers had immigrated to Columbus, Ohio, a few years earlier, and he helped her make arrangements to cross into the U.S. “There were about a dozen of us,” she recalled. “It was a small truck, with the seats taken out. They told us to lie down in the back, head to feet, feet to head, so there would be room for everyone.” They drove for about three hours, stopped at a mobile home in the desert, then continued on to Phoenix. A friend had set up another ride, which would take them across the country, to Ohio. “It was so cold, and I didn’t have a jacket,” Flores said. “We slept in the car and ate at McDonald’s. It was the first burger I ever had. It was very tasty.” When she reached Columbus, she paid her brother a thousand dollars, which he turned over to the guides, or coyotes, who had made the trip possible.","1488","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Eventually, Flores got a job as a cashier at a Wendy’s. “It was really hard for me, because I couldn’t tell what the Americans wanted,” she said. “When I learned more English, I started taking orders.” She soon met David Flores, who was also in the United States illegally. They got married and had twin boys, David and Luis, in 2000, and a third son, Iker, four years ago. “David has always been a really good person and a really good father,” Flores said. “In Mexico, we are used to men not washing dishes and not doing anything around the house, and he is the opposite.” Today, David operates a taco truck, which he stations in a parking lot near the small duplex apartment where the family lives, just outside Columbus. David is in the truck from 11 A.M. to 9 P.M. on weekdays, and on Sundays he works at McDonald’s. When Olga is not caring for the children, she is in her kitchen, preparing the rice, intestines, and tongue for the truck.","1489","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Like many people who have arrived illegally from Mexico, Flores has built a productive life here. She is a longtime resident, has no criminal record, and is the parent of American citizens. Through much of Barack Obama’s Presidency, there was a political near-consensus regarding the need to address the status of immigrants like Flores. Under the immigration-reform law passed by the Senate in 2013, she would have had a path to become a citizen; under the executive actions announced by President Obama in 2014, she could have obtained work papers and a driver’s license. But the House failed to vote on the Senate’s immigration bill, and a federal court in Texas has placed Obama’s initiative on hold.","1490","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The result is a comprehensive breakdown in public policy. During the Obama Administration, which purports to be dedicated to easing the plight of residents like her, Flores and her peers have faced greater threats of deportation than at any time in decades. Republicans, for their part, have ended their brief experiment, reflected in the Senate bill, in bipartisanship on immigration. The Party is now close to united in opposition to any initiative that might offer Flores and others the chance to become American citizens. Flores, and the roughly eleven million people in similar situations, have no choice but to wait and worry.","1491","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Donald Trump, in his speech announcing his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination, in June, addressed the issue of illegal immigration from Mexico. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” (The crime rate among first-generation immigrants is significantly lower than that of the general population, according to Bianca Bersani, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.) Trump’s remarks prompted several of his business partners, including Univision and Macy’s, to sever their ties with him, but the comments have led to relatively little examination of the lives of the immigrants themselves.","1492","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"For many years, Flores’s legal status existed for her as a kind of background anxiety, affecting her life in modest ways. Because traffic stops by the police could lead to deportation, she drove the family car as little as possible, and never out of state. “Here, at least, we know the city, we know the streets, we know which are one-way or two-way,” she said. “If we go somewhere else, we are scared that we don’t know the area.” Now her situation has taken on a new urgency. Early this year, her son Iker had a series of infections that proved resistant to treatment. “The first two times that I took him to the doctor, they said it was an ear infection and then a throat infection, and they did not draw blood. On the fourteenth of February, we noticed that he had some red dots on his ears. That’s when they drew blood. Four days later, they told me he had cancer of the blood”—acute lymphocytic leukemia. Iker has begun a course of chemotherapy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, in Columbus, which is likely to take three or four years.","1493","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“Before I had children, I thought about what if the police would pick me up—I would just leave, go back to Mexico, even though I haven’t been there in a long time,” Flores told me. “Now that my child is sick, I really do worry. Medicine back home is very different. When you go to the doctor, you have to take money before things happen. He has a higher probability of surviving in the United States. Now we have to stay.”","1494","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"When I visited the Floreses’ apartment, Olga demonstrated a trick with sour cream that she had learned during a stint working at Chipotle. She emptied a five-pound jar into a metal bowl, then whipped it with a wooden spoon. “If you whip it first, it comes out of the squirt bottles easier,” she said. The family’s duplex is in a town-house development. There are two refrigerators squeezed into the kitchen, to accommodate the restaurant-size quantities of food that the family must buy and prepare every week for the taco truck. Iker sat on the sofa watching cartoons on a big-screen television. He’s an outgoing kid, who moves seamlessly between English and Spanish, but he has been having a tough time with the chemotherapy. He’s weak and very thin, and has trouble keeping food down. Lately, he has been struggling to walk up the stairs to his bedroom, so Olga is carrying him around more than she once did.

"Shortly after Iker’s cancer was diagnosed, Flores went to see Julie Nemecek, an immigration lawyer in Columbus, to ask about her options for establishing a more secure basis for remaining in the United States. Nemecek had handled many similar cases before. “Most of the people I hear from have been in Ohio for a long time, and the vast majority are undocumented, because they snuck across the border,” she said. “They have made lives here. They have been in hiding, hoping that when they drive to work or take their kids to school they won’t get stopped.” Nemecek offers clients like Flores little reassurance. “Everything is in limbo, so people are uncertain, and they feel hopeless,” she said.","1496","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"When Barack Obama ran for the Presidency, he pledged to enact comprehensive immigration reform, but he didn’t push the issue in his first two years in office, when Democrats had strong majorities in both houses of Congress. Instead, he made what became known as a “down payment” for a bipartisan immigration bill later in his Presidency.","1497","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“There was definitely in the Obama Administration an intention to do tough enforcement as a down payment for comprehensive immigration reform later,” Marc Rosenblum, of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said. Rosenblum is the deputy director of the institute’s U.S.-immigration-policy program. “The idea was to prove to Republicans that he could be trusted on enforcement, so that he could get a path to citizenship in return.”","1498","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The first part of the down payment was to toughen enforcement at the Mexican border. Under Obama, a record number of agents are patrolling the border: nearly twenty thousand, roughly five times as many as there were two decades ago. In the light of this change, the Obama Administration has claimed that the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border has reached a forty-year low. (The faltering economy during Obama’s first term, which made the United States a less promising destination, was certainly another important factor in the decline.)","1499","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The more controversial part of Obama’s down payment involved immigrants who had already arrived and settled in the United States. The Administration greatly expanded a program known as Secure Communities, in which information was shared between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the F.B.I. Whenever anyone was arrested and booked, his or her fingerprints would be sent to the F.B.I., as before, but now the information would also go to the immigration authorities. “It was a huge force multiplier,” Rosenblum said. “The program was pitched as a tool to find serious criminals, but, at least initially, the vast majority of people were picked up for traffic violations and very minor offenses. A lot of these people ended up being deported.” Julie Nemecek recalled, “Around 2010, the number of my Mexican clients increased, with enforcement getting really, really heavy because of Secure Communities. People were getting picked up left and right when their only offense was driving without a license or drunk driving.” As a result of tougher enforcement, deportations soared under Obama. Since 2009, removals of illegal immigrants have averaged more than four hundred thousand per year, compared with an average of two hundred and fifty thousand per year under George W. Bush.","1500","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Secure Communities had an enormous impact on the day-to-day lives of Latinos in the United States. “There are people who are not a safety threat who are snared into the deportation apparatus,” Clarissa Martínez, the deputy vice-president of the National Council of La Raza, a leading Hispanic-rights organization, told me. “Also, when you start deputizing local law enforcement to help apply immigration law, you are going to have abuses, and that’s what happened. People feel that regardless of whether you are first-, second-, third-generation American, the folks who are going to be stopped are going to be Latinos.” Rosenblum said, “Until the last decade or so, the chances were, if you made it past the border, you were not going to get deported, unless you were committing serious crimes. But, with the crackdown, the broader immigrant community felt under attack. They lived here, and suddenly they were unable to work, unable to drive.”","1501","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Still, the underlying theory was that Secure Communities would be the stick, and comprehensive immigration reform would be the carrot—and the goal appeared within reach after Obama was reëlected, in 2012. The defeat of Mitt Romney brought Republicans to the realization that they had to broaden their appeal to Hispanics, the fastest-growing group of potential voters in the nation. In March of 2013, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, released a report that said the Party “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” In short order, many Republicans in the Senate, including such prominent figures as John McCain and Marco Rubio, did just that, and a bill that included a path to citizenship for people like Olga Flores passed by a vote of sixty-eight to thirty-two.","1502","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The battle over immigration reform presents a clash of fundamentally different visions of the role of the federal government. The President and his allies assert that their position is based on a combination of realism and compassion. They argue that it’s impossible to deport all of the country’s illegal immigrants. In addition, they say, it’s heartless to break up families who are long settled in the United States.","1503","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Opponents of reform, who are led by Jeff Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama, believe that national security, along with the rule of law, compels a different approach. “If everyone who enters the country illegally can stay and become a citizen, that just encourages more people to come illegally,” Sessions told me. “If people see that they have nothing to fear after they cross the border and settle here, then that creates an incentive for more people to come, and that’s wrong. If they are here illegally, they should be deported.” What’s more, he argues, a porous border invites criminals, including terrorists, to settle in the promised land of the United States.","1504","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Yet John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, and Eric Cantor, the Majority Leader, described themselves as supporters of immigration reform, and it was clear after the 2012 election that the votes were there to pass it. “Boehner promised the President that he was going to bring a bill to the floor,” a former White House aide told me. “There’s always a significant House-versus-Senate rivalry, so the Senate bill itself was going to be a nonstarter in the House. But some sort of reform bill was sure to pass if it came to a vote.” Virtually all of the Democrats in the House, as well as some Republicans, supported comprehensive reform along the lines of the Senate bill, but immigration reform was anathema to the Tea Party. Boehner asked staff from the House leadership to come up with a proposal that modified the Senate bill without gutting it. The result was an outline of recommendations, but conservatives in the House persuaded Boehner to back away from them.","1505","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"After the passage of the Senate bill, chances for any sort of reform bill in the House began to recede. The government shutdown, for two weeks in October of 2013, poisoned relations between the President and congressional Republicans. Then, on June 10, 2014, Cantor lost a primary to a poorly funded and largely unknown challenger, who focussed his campaign on Cantor’s alleged softness on illegal immigration. The victor, David Brat, went on to win the seat. Republican support for reform suddenly vanished. As the former White House aide told me, “There was always this germ of hope, but then Eric Cantor lost his primary. There was probably a five-per-cent chance before that, and it went to zero.”","1506","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Olga Flores speaks English imperfectly, so some of our conversations were interpreted by Jessica Pantaleon Camacho, who works as an assistant in Julie Nemecek’s law office. Pantaleon Camacho was born in Mexico twenty years ago and brought to the U.S. illegally as a three-year-old. “When I started going to high school, I convinced myself that school was the only way I could get my family out of the situation,” she told me. “I took all Advanced Placement classes starting in my sophomore year. I graduated near the top of my class.” Her teachers wrote enthusiastic recommendations to colleges, and Pantaleon Camacho was accepted at several schools, with scholarship offers. “When I was about to graduate, we had to decide what school,” she said. “That’s when they told me that I needed a Social Security number. I wasn’t able to provide it.”","1507","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Pantaleon Camacho is among the “Dreamers,” the term that has come to define the group of people who were brought illegally to the United States when they were children. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, known as the DREAM Act, was presented several years ago as a modest alternative to the round of comprehensive immigration reform that was stalled in Congress at the time. The law would provide a path to citizenship for people like Pantaleon Camacho, who had essentially lived their entire lives as Americans. It failed, and the President began taking a series of unilateral executive actions designed to ease the plight of the Dreamers. On June 15, 2012, the Obama Administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program would give as many as 1.7 million people work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation, which was renewable for another two years. In most cases, this meant that the Dreamers were also eligible for driver’s licenses and, in some states, for in-state tuition at state universities. Almost eight hundred thousand individuals applied for DACA coverage, and about eighty-four per cent of them were approved.","1508","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Pantaleon Camacho was one of them. “It has changed my life,” she told me. “I have a Social Security number and a driver’s license. I am able to drive without fear of being pulled over and being sent back to Mexico.” Her job in the lawyer’s office is on the books. She was admitted to Bowling Green, a state university in Ohio, but she is ineligible for any scholarship assistance, so she takes classes at a local community college. “It all comes out of my own pocket,” Pantaleon Camacho told me. Her situation is much improved but still tenuous: her DACA status expires roughly at the end of the Obama Administration, and no one knows what the next President will do with the program.","1509","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"DACA did nothing to help families like the Floreses, in which the parents came to the U.S. as adults and the children were born here. By 2014, immigration activists began putting greater pressure on Obama to take executive action to help more families. “When Boehner pulled out of the process, that’s when there was a total focus on the President, because the legislative door had been shut,” Clarissa Martínez, of La Raza, said. The White House felt the heat. “There was a period in 2014 when the immigration activists gave up on Congress and said it’s now on the President,” the former White House aide said. “They started calling him Deporter-in-Chief. The President brought them all in. He said by criticizing him they were letting the Republicans off the hook. He said he needed more time. He said, ‘I will do everything I can at the end of the summer.’ ” But Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races, like Kay Hagan, in North Carolina, implored the White House not to take any controversial steps on immigration before the midterm elections. Obama agreed; activists seethed; virtually all the Democratic candidates, including Hagan, lost anyway.","1510","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Finally, on November 20, 2014, just a few weeks after the elections, Obama launched his long-awaited series of executive actions on immigration. As the President explained in a rare prime-time address from the White House, the centerpiece was an initiative called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, known as DAPA. This program, which would be run by the Department of Homeland Security, was aimed at the parents of American citizens who were themselves illegally in the country but had been law-abiding residents of the United States since 2010. Following a case-by-case review, they would receive an immigration status known as “deferred action,” enabling them to apply for work permits and driver’s licenses. DAPA was intended to cover about 3.6 million people, more than thirty per cent of the illegal immigrants in the United States. The D.H.S. made plans to hire as many as three thousand new employees, some of whom would work in Arlington, Virginia, in an eleven-story building that the government leased for $7.8 million a year. (Also on November 20th, Obama expanded eligibility for the DACA program, and replaced Secure Communities with a program that targets serious criminals.) According to Obama’s plan, the government would begin accepting applications for deferred action under DAPA in February, 2015.","1511","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“DAPA is of tremendous magnitude,” Clarissa Martínez said. “It’s what Americans want of the undocumented community—that they come forward, go through criminal-background checks, and those who are working do so legally. For the American public, it sounds practical and pragmatic to give people who have deep roots in the community and have good moral character a chance to get right with the law. The announcement of these programs was an incredible step forward and the biggest progress we’ve seen on the issue in two decades.”","1512","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The Floreses pride themselves on using fresh, authentic ingredients for their food truck. Olga showed off a large maguey leaf, from a variety of agave, which David was about to cut up, toast, and use as a seasoning for the meat before he grilled it. “The best things,” Olga said.","1513","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Olga Flores has not closely followed the twists and turns in immigration policy, but, like most immigrants, she was aware of DAPA and planned to take advantage of it. There is a cruel asymmetry to immigration law: the people with the most at stake have the most trouble understanding it. This is because, even for lawyers, immigration law is notoriously complicated. It’s related to, but ultimately very different from, other criminal or civil litigation; immigration law has its own traditions and doctrines—and the rules often change. For civilians, the morass is difficult to navigate, and for non-English-speaking immigrants the law can be nearly impenetrable. Still, everyone knew that Obama’s November 20th directives were hugely significant. On the night of Obama’s speech, many immigration-rights groups around the country held viewing parties to celebrate the news. Flores was hopeful, too. “We were very excited,” she told me.","1514","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"But two weeks after Obama’s announcement Texas and sixteen other states sued the federal government to stop the DAPA program. Eight states joined later. The heart of the case against the Administration is the contention that Obama overstepped his authority in establishing the program. “The case isn’t about any particular immigration policy; it’s about the rule of law,” Scott Keller, the Texas solicitor general, told me. “DAPA rewrites the immigration statutes, and the executive does not have unilateral authority to do that. Congress has not granted the executive the power to deem people who are unlawfully in the country to be eligible for work permits, Medicare, unemployment benefits, and access to international travel. Congress has done quite the opposite. The executive can’t do it alone.”","1515","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Obama Administration lawyers fired back from several directions. First, they argued that Texas and the other states lacked standing—that is, that they had no right to file the case in the first place, because DAPA imposed no obligations on the states. “The core of Texas’s argument is that they will have to pay for driver’s licenses for the beneficiaries of DAPA,” an Administration official told me. “But that’s not enough to get them standing. It’s a very incidental expense, and they could raise their prices to cover it, anyway. States don’t get to sue just because they don’t like the policies of the federal government, and that’s what this case is really about.” The plaintiffs have argued that they have standing because DAPA will encourage illegal immigration, which would be an imposition on states. Yet fourteen states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of DAPA, asserting that the program would actually help, not burden, individual states. “When immigrants are able to work legally—even for a limited time—their wages increase, they seek work compatible with their skill level, and they enhance their skills to obtain higher wages, all of which benefits State economies by increasing income and growing the tax base,” the brief explains.","1516","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"On the merits, too, Administration lawyers argued that the President was within his rights to extend these benefits to undocumented people. “This whole case is a matter of enforcement priorities,” the official said. “We can deport four hundred thousand people a year, but we can’t deport all eleven million undocumented people here, so the President has a right to establish his priorities for the limited time he is in office. And he’s saying that he is not going to deport people with children and ties to the community who are willing to undergo a background check.” George H. W. Bush had a similar program for a select group of immigrants, and it proceeded with little fanfare and no legal challenge.","1517","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Like the plaintiffs in many civil cases, the Texas solicitor general had wide latitude in choosing the court where he wanted to file the suit. Lawyers often do some judge-shopping if they think it will help them win their cases, and it was quickly evident that the Texas lawyers shopped wisely. Keller’s predecessor brought the lawsuit in Brownsville, close to the Mexican border. The local federal judge assigned to the case, Andrew Hanen, had already shown a marked hostility toward President Obama’s immigration policies. Hanen had been appointed to the district court in 2002 by George W. Bush, and, in earlier rulings, he had called the President’s deportation policy “misguided” and asserted that it “endangers America.”","1518","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"According to the President’s plan, the government was going to begin accepting applications for deferred action under DAPA on February 18th. Less than forty-eight hours before the program went into effect, Judge Hanen filed a hundred-and-twenty-three-page opinion issuing a preliminary injunction that put DAPA on hold. In the case known as Texas v. United States, he ruled that Texas and the other states did have standing to challenge the law, and then he ruled against the Administration on an esoteric but important matter. Hanen held that the Administration had failed to follow the correct procedures in putting DAPA into effect; he said that the Department of Homeland Security should have given the public the chance to be heard in what’s known as notice-and-comment rule-making before implementing the new policy. The opinion did not directly address the underlying legality of DAPA, but the judge offered clear hints that he was dubious about the program. DAPA “does not represent mere inadequacy; it is complete abdication,” Hanen wrote. “The D.H.S. does have discretion in the manner in which it chooses to fulfill the expressed will of Congress. It cannot, however, enact a program whereby it not only ignores the dictates of Congress, but actively acts to thwart them.”","1519","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"In a further rebuff to the Administration, Judge Hanen issued a stay on DAPA covering the entire country, even though his jurisdiction covered only part of Texas. Administration lawyers rushed an appeal of Hanen’s stay to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit—one of the most conservative circuits in the country. On May 26th, a panel of the appeals court ruled, two judges to one, that Hanen was correct to enjoin DAPA. Earlier this month, during a hearing before another three-judge panel, the same two judges maintained their skepticism about Obama’s immigration initiative. Regardless of what the Fifth Circuit ultimately rules, the losing party will still have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. As Jeff Sessions, Obama’s chief adversary in Congress, put it, “The courts may take longer than the President will be in office.” The Department of Homeland Security has put the plan to hire three thousand people to administer DAPA on indefinite hold.","1520","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"It’s always been a key part of the Administration’s plan to establish DAPA before the end of Obama’s term, making it difficult for any successor to withdraw a benefit that has already been granted. But by delaying his actions until after the 2014 midterms the President may have given his opponents, in Congress and in the courts, the time and the tools to unravel his most important work on immigration.","1521","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The oncology and hematology clinic of Nationwide Children’s Hospital is a determinedly sunny place. The furniture in the waiting room is colorful, the pictures on the walls cheerful. Entertainment options for the young patients abound. Iker Flores perched himself on an examination table and quickly lost himself in a video game. His prognosis is good; his cancer has a very high survival rate. Iker has become used to the chemo port affixed to his chest. But the treatment sessions, which last as long as twelve hours at a time, are gruelling. This visit was to check his blood to see if he was ready for a chemo session the next day. The doctors decided to put off treatment for a little while to allow Iker to regain some strength.","1522","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The strain on the family, financial and otherwise, is considerable. The Flores children have health insurance through a nonprofit company in Ohio called CareSource, and the hospital has not pressed them for additional payments. But Olga had to give up part-time work cleaning houses to take care of Iker. He had been attending a Head Start program when he became sick, but he’s had to drop out. “The timing for DAPA was perfect for us,” Olga told me. “Even a few days before he was diagnosed, he was going to school nine to two. Now he can’t even go to school. I was helping my husband. Now I can’t work.”","1523","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"At one point, immigration represented a kind of exception to the polarization that dominates contemporary politics in Washington. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama pushed Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. And the Senate passed its bipartisan immigration bill only two years ago. But, as the Presidential campaign has heated up, the issue has come to split the parties in stark ways. “The experience under Obama and Bush has upped the ante on what we want to hear from candidates that are vying for the Presidency in 2016,” Clarissa Martínez said. “Both Obama and Bush said they wanted to get it done, and their hearts may have been in the right place, but they both ran into trouble with Congress. That’s why hearing that somebody believes in immigration reform is not good enough. We want to know what they will do on their own as President.”","1524","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Trump’s comments about immigrants from Mexico drew condemnation from many Republicans for his impolitic tone, but, in their substance, his views are widely shared within the Party. At various times, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, and Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor, all supported versions of immigration reform that would allow people like Olga Flores to become citizens. All have tacked right. Bush has talked recently of a path to “legalized status” for undocumented aliens rather than a path to citizenship; he also said recently that he would repeal DACA and DAPA. Rubio has said that he now favors a piecemeal approach to immigration, rather than a comprehensive bill; and Walker recently said, “I don’t believe in amnesty” for those who have entered the country illegally. Rubio and Walker have also denounced DACA and DAPA. The other Republican candidates have talked about immigration almost exclusively in terms of border enforcement. Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, recently asked a group of supporters to “imagine a President that finally, finally, finally secures the borders,” and he criticized Obama’s “lawlessness and the President’s unconstitutional executive amnesty.”","1525","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Hillary Clinton, in contrast, has staked out a position to the left of President Obama. In an appearance in Las Vegas, in May, Clinton said, “We can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship.” She said it was “beyond absurd” to think that all eleven million illegal immigrants in the country could be deported. And she said that she would expand DACA and DAPA. “If Congress continues to refuse to act, as President I would do everything possible under the law to go even further,” she said, suggesting, for example, that she would extend protection to the parents of Dreamers.","1526","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"For now, though, the only certainty for Olga Flores and others in similar situations is more uncertainty. If Clinton wins, and Congress remains in Republican hands, the new President will be reduced to attempting the same kind of piecemeal executive actions as Obama—if the courts even allow those to proceed. If a Republican wins, Flores’s chances of deportation will rise. Either way, the issue will remain on the national agenda, even as the opportunity to come to any solution continues to recede. ♦","1527","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"

"This time, though, it’s slightly different. Hours after Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, a suspected homegrown Islamist terrorist, shot and killed four U.S. Marines at a Naval Reserve center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Donald Trump, who is now leading the polls in the Republican Presidential primary, seized upon the tragedy, claiming that the problem isn’t the proliferation of deadly firearms, but a lack of them in certain locales, such as the so-called “gun-free zones” at military sites.","1529","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"According to news reports, Abdulazeez, a twenty-four-year-old Kuwaiti-born U.S. citizen, was armed with at least three guns, including an AK-47 assault rifle. How he got hold of these weapons wasn’t what concerned Trump, however. “Get rid of gun free zones,” he tweeted on Friday morning. “The four great marines who were just shot never had a chance. They were highly trained but helpless without guns.”","1530","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"Trump was evidently referring to a Pentagon regulation, dating back to 1993, that prohibits some members of the military from carrying firearms while on base. His comments echoed those of gun enthusiasts, who highlighted, on social media, a picture of a sign prohibiting firearms that was on the door of the Chattanooga military-recruitment office where Abdulazeez reportedly opened fire before moving onto the Naval Reserve center, less than ten miles away.","1531","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"

"As usual, however, Trump has things backward. The issue isn’t gun-free zones; it is free-for-all gun zones, which decades of lax firearms laws have produced all over the country. In an America held hostage by the gun lobby, radicalized lone-wolf terrorists can get their hands on deadly weapons and mountains of ammunition just as easily as disturbed post-adolescents, delusional military subcontractors, virulent racists, and anybody else.","1533","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"If the initial reports about Abdulazeez’s radicalization prove accurate, this will be the second attack in three months attempted by heavily armed homegrown Islamists. In Garland, Texas, in May, a sharp-shooting traffic cop killed two would-be attackers before they could reach their target, a crowd attending an event featuring cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad. Like Abdulazeez, Elton Simpson and Nadir Hamid Soofi were both American Muslims, and they, too, were reportedly armed with AK-47s.","1534","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"According to officials, at least some of the weapons in Abdulazeez’s possession were obtained legally. We don’t know yet whether the authorities had any prior inkling of his conversion to radical Islam. In the Garland case, it turned out that Simpson had been the subject of an F.B.I. inquiry into his possible links to extremist groups. Indeed, back in 2011, according to the Times, he had been convicted of lying to federal agents about a planned visit to Somalia. But that didn’t prevent Simpson and Soofi from arming themselves for their attack. According to a law-enforcement source cited in a CNN report, they had six weapons in their car, all of which had been bought legally.","1535","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"Evidently, the existing system of background checks for gun purchases failed to raise any alarms in these two instances. That was also the case with a .45-calibre handgun bought by Dylann Roof, who was arrested for the shootings in at a Charleston church last month, and it has been the case with all too many others who have carried out massacres.","1536","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"Trump ignores all of this, of course, and he couldn’t even get the details straight about those “gun-free zones.” He ignored the fact that the military police who enforce the laws on military installations are routinely armed, as are other soldiers engaged in security roles, such as guard duty. Moreover, the four marines were killed not at the recruitment center, where the sign prohibiting firearms was located, but at the Naval Reserve center. It was there, too, that Abdulazeez was reportedly shot dead by police, who had pursued him from the recruitment office. Sadly, neither the military guards nor the police managed to stop Abdulazeez before he had killed four people. But to claim that these victims would be alive if they had been armed is pure speculation.","1537","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"What isn’t speculation is that America has witnessed yet another gun massacre—which doesn’t, unfortunately, imply that policy changes are likely. In the past sixty years, the laxity of this country’s gun laws has survived just about everything: Presidential assassinations and attempted assassinations, drug wars, gang wars, cops getting shot, children accidentally shooting themselves or their parents, an epidemic of gun suicides, workplace massacres, mall massacres, theatre massacres, school massacres, and even church massacres. Now, we have another deadly phenomenon that highlights the dangers of ready access to firearms: the rise of domestically grown Islamist terrorists.","1538","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"At least two reactions are possible.","1539","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"One, favored by Trump and the N.R.A, would counter guns with more guns. They would further encourage the proliferation of hidden-carry laws, which enable people to carry concealed weapons, and place heavily armed guards anywhere a potential terrorist could strike—at government buildings, sports grounds, schools, theatres, transport hubs, malls, even churches. Over time, such a strategy would turn the United States into an even more militarized place than it already is. Whether it would prevent more terrorist attacks is a lot less clear.","1540","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"The other option is the one that anti-gun activists, police chiefs, and sensible politicians have been promoting for decades: reform guns laws to keep deadly weapons, particularly rapid-fire guns, out of the hands of disturbed individuals and people of ill intent. Such a policy agenda wouldn’t stamp out domestically grown jihadism either. But it would surely make things more difficult for would-be attackers.","1541","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"Which way will America go? It’s hard to know, but one conclusion can’t be avoided: in an era of domestic terrorism, gun laws are turning into a national-security issue.","1542","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lax-gun-laws-are-becoming-a-national-security-issue"
"Anyone who has followed Hillary Clinton’s career knows that she regards encounters with political reporters with about the same level of enthusiasm that most people regard dental appointments. “Look, she hates you. Period,” one Clinton campaign veteran told Politico’s Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman (who has since moved to the Times) last year. “That’s never going to change.”","July 8, 2015","1543","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Fair enough. After all the horrible things that have been written and said over the years about the former First Lady and Secretary of State, and about her family, it would be surprising if she didn’t dislike the media. But, as Ronald Reagan’s handlers discovered many years ago, the problem with giving journalists the slip, which Clinton has been doing with evident enthusiasm in the early weeks of her Democratic primary campaign, is that eventually this avoidance strategy becomes the story. So, just as Michael Deaver, Larry Speakes, et al. prevailed on the Gipper to do the occasional press conference in an effort to keep the jackals at bay, Clinton’s communications advisers evidently persuaded her to sit down with CNN’s Brianna Keilar for an interview that was advertised as the first of many media interactions to come.","1544","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"If the Clinton campaign thought that she would be treated more softly by Keilar than by one of the network’s more well-known names—Wolf Blitzer or Jake Tapper, say—it was disappointed. Keilar peppered Clinton with questions about the private e-mail server she used as Secretary of State, polls showing that many American distrust her, and the big crowds that her opponent Bernie Sanders is attracting. Then, when Tapper asked Keilar about the interview, Keilar criticized the answers Clinton gave her, saying, “I did not hear a more open or transparent Hillary Clinton.”","1545","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Keilar’s raspberry wasn’t the only one blown in Clinton’s direction. She “looked and sounded cagey and defensive, when her apparent goal is to inspire,” Lloyd Grove, an editor-at-large for the Daily Beast, wrote, adding, “The candidate was, by turns, self-justifying and pugnacious, and occasionally just plain inauthentic.”","1546","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Clinton certainly didn’t sound very convincing at times, especially when she sought to blame Republicans for whipping up concerns about her deleted e-mails and other matters. Given that she didn’t have anything new to announce, it was perhaps surprising that the campaign chose to put her out there now. Why not wait until next week, when she is due to give a speech laying out some economic proposals? As Clinton showed when she steered a question from Keilar about Donald Trump toward the Republican Party’s position on immigration, she’s much more comfortable and persuasive when talking about policy issues.","1547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"On the positive side, Clinton avoided making any major gaffes, which was probably her primary goal. In today’s always-on media climate, attacks and mistakes dominate the news cycle, and all campaigns know this. If a campaign can supply the former and avoid the latter, it is doing fine. Failure to abide by this maxim leads into Trump territory, where his obnoxious remarks about Mexicans are currently doing serious damage to his business empire. (David Remnick has more on Trump’s campaign.)","1548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"In any case, forging a working relationship with the national media is just one of two immediate challenges facing Clinton. The other—what to do about the rise of Bernie Sanders—is far more important. Earlier this week, in a front-page piece in the Times, the Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, who ran Howard Dean’s 2004 Presidential campaign, was quoted as saying about Clinton, “Certainly she could lose Iowa.”","1549","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Even if this happened, Trippi added, Clinton would probably go on to win the nomination. That’s true. But just a few weeks ago, the very idea of Sanders winning the Iowa primary would have seemed far-fetched. Now, perceptions are changing. In an interview with Politico (for a piece headlined “The socialist surge”), Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor, compared Sanders to Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern, two liberals who, in 1968 and 1972, picked up a lot of support in the early primary states and derailed establishment favorites.","1550","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"It’s far too early to mention Hillary Clinton in the same breath as Lyndon B. Johnson or Ed Muskie, but how she chooses to deal with the Sanders phenomenon will have a greater impact on public opinion than whether she gives regular media interviews. So far, she has largely adopted a watching brief. A Clinton adviser admitted to the Times that the campaign had underestimated Sanders’ appeal in Iowa, but added, “It’s too early to change strategy because no one knows if Sanders will be able to hold on to these voters in the months ahead.”","1551","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Most likely, he will hold on to a good number of them.","1552","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"There are two reasons Sanders is doing so well. Firstly, he’s perceived as an outsider, and he’s tapping into a progressive movement that has little faith in the Democratic Party establishment. Secondly, the primary timetable favors him. On a national basis, according to a recent CNN/O.R.C. poll of likely Democratic voters, Clinton still has a huge lead over Sanders: fifty-seven per cent to fourteen per cent. (In fact, the poll found that Sanders was in third place, behind Vice President Biden, who got sixteen per cent despite not having entered the race.) It so happens, though, that Iowa and New Hampshire both contain many white, college-educated liberals who are sympathetic to the Vermont senator’s views. Sanders is polling less well among other elements of the Democratic coalition, particularly African-Americans and Hispanics, who won’t come out in force until the primary contest moves to states like South Carolina.","1553","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Clearly, Clinton can’t do anything about the electoral calendar. Can she successfully counter Sanders’s political message in the early primary states? Over the next few weeks, as she starts rolling out her campaign proposals, we should get some indication. After that, she is planning on taking a vacation. The schedule for televised Democratic debates, of which there will be half a dozen, has yet to be set, and voting day in Iowa is still almost seven months away. But the race is now on.","1554","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"

"The Times report that Vice-President Joe Biden is seriously considering entering the 2016 Presidential race isn’t exactly news. He’s been mulling such a move for at least a couple of years. “It’s as likely I run as I don’t run,” Biden said on the talk show “The View” in February, 2014. In an interview with Politico’s Glenn Thrush that month, he laid out the sort of campaign he could conduct, focussing on rising inequality and the wage squeeze. “It’s either going to be me or someone else who is going to make this argument in the Democratic Party.” As I wrote at the time, “He’s still full of energy, he’s served President Obama loyally, he loves the game, and he thinks—pundits and pollsters be damned—that this might be the moment for an old-school, shit-kicking, hand-grasping, mouth-running, stick-up-for-the-working-stiff pol like himself.”","August 3, 2015","1561","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"During the year and a half after those stories appeared, Hillary Clinton cemented her position as a prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination, and most pundits assumed Biden was out. That was premature. In January of this year, he told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that he still hadn’t made up his mind, noting, “There’s plenty of time.” Now, however, the clock is ticking. In recent weeks, as Amy Chozick, of the Times, reported on Saturday, some of Biden’s aides have been meeting with potential donors and campaign staffers who have not yet committed to Clinton. The report said that confidants of Biden expect him to make a final decision one way or the other by early September.","1562","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Two things appear to have prompted Biden to get serious. The first was the death, in May, of his forty-six-year-old son Beau, who had urged his father to take a third and final tilt at the Presidency. (Biden’s previous campaigns were in 1988 and 2008.) The other factor was the growing perception among political professionals that Clinton could be vulnerable in a general election, which is partly based on polling data showing that many voters distrust her. “The No. 1 thing voters want is a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, and the veep is leading in those polls,” William Pierce, the executive director of the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC, told Chozick.","1563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"The poll that Pierce was referring to was carried out by Quinnipiac University and released late last week. It found that just thirty-seven per cent of likely voters find Clinton “honest and trustworthy,” and that fifty-seven per cent don’t. For Biden, the figures were reversed. Fifty-eight per cent of the respondents said that they found him honest and trustworthy; thirty-four per cent said they didn’t. The Vice-President also led the former Secretary of State on the issue of empathy. Asked whether he “cares about the needs and problems of people like you or not,” fifty-seven per cent said yes, and thirty-five per cent said no. When the pollsters asked the same question about Clinton, forty-five per cent of people said yes, and fifty-two per cent said no.","1564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"This was just one poll, and its results didn’t all come out in Biden’s favor. Fifty-eight per cent of respondents said that Clinton had “strong leadership qualities,” compared to fifty-two per cent for Biden. Still, the survey found that in head-to-head contests with the Republican candidates, Biden did at least as well as Clinton. In a matchup with Jeb Bush, Clinton trailed by one percentage point, and Biden led by one point; in a matchup with Donald Trump, they both led by twelve percentage points.","1565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"If these figures are taken at face value, they suggest that Biden could be a viable candidate in the general election. But in order to get there, he would have to overcome Clinton’s enormous lead in money, organization, and electoral support. The Clinton campaign has already raised well over fifty million dollars, and it is aiming to raise a hundred million by the end of the year. (That doesn’t count all the money that will be raised by super PACs and other organizations allied with Hillary.) Clinton already has big political operations in the early voting states. And, according to the Huffington Post’s poll average, she is leading Bernie Sanders by 56.9 per cent to 18.9 per cent among likely Democratic voters.","1566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Although he’s not currently a candidate, Biden is in third place, with twelve per cent of the vote. If he were to enter the race, that figure would almost certainly rise, at least for a while. But he would still be a long-shot candidate. Positioning himself to the left of Clinton, he would be competing with Bernie Sanders for the votes of progressive Democrats, some of whom wouldn’t welcome his late entry. He would also need to pick up support from moderates who have doubts about the Clintons.","1567","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"At seventy-two, Biden potentially faces an age issue. (Clinton is five years his junior; Sanders is a year older.) A bigger challenge, however, might be demonstrating that he has what it takes to be President. Despite his long history as a senator and Vice-President, many members of the political and media establishment have long seen him as lacking the necessary gravitas and depth for the highest office. Doubts about Biden’s seriousness date back to his 1988 Presidential bid, which was derailed by allegations that he had exaggerated his college record and plagiarized part of a speech.","1568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Nineteen eighty-eight is a long time ago, and Biden has achieved a lot since then, including serving as Vice-President for the past six and a half years. An eminently decent and likable man, he has never had the stench of corruption that attaches itself to many people who stay in Washington for a long time. About the worst that you hear said about him is that he is a blowhard who occasionally blurts out embarrassing things.","1569","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"In an era of scripted politicians and carefully orchestrated campaigns, some Democrats may see Biden’s spontaneity as a plus. And the issues of the moment play to his strengths. As long ago as 1988, he was talking about increasing social mobility, defending the middle class, and challenging the notion that you can’t buck the market. “For too long in this society, we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community,” he said in his first announcement speech. “For too long as a nation, we have been lulled by the anthem of self-interest. . . . We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference.”","1570","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Back then, Biden was a youngish Roman Catholic pol on the up, and, doubtless, the echoes of John F. Kennedy in his speech were deliberate. Today, he is older and more grizzled (as are many of the rest of us). Taking on the Clintons and the Republicans is a task that would give anyone pause, let alone a seventy-two-year-old who has just lost his son. Even after the latest round of speculation, it is perfectly possible, indeed likely, that he will stay out of the race. But if he decides to give it a go, he might surprise a few people.","1571","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Hillary Clinton, in her memoir “Living History,” recounts her struggle to defend her privacy while residing in the White House. Some of her stories have a gothic tone. After Bill Clinton’s first inauguration, Harry and Linda Thomason, friends from Hollywood, found a jocular note under a pillow in the Lincoln Bedroom. It was from Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host. How did the note get there? “I don’t believe in ghosts, but we did sometimes feel that the White House was haunted by more temporal entities,” Clinton writes.","1572","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"A few months later, as she grieved over the death of her father, she noticed that furniture in the living quarters had been disturbed. She discovered that security officers had searched for bugging devices, without consulting her. “I suddenly remembered the Rush Limbaugh note,” she writes. “I was undone by the invasion of privacy. Yes, we were living in a house that belongs to our nation. But there’s an understanding that individuals who occupy it are allowed some rooms of their own.”","1573","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"That sensibility partly explains this summer’s Clinton non-scandal or mini-scandal or proto-scandal, as it may be. The matter arose from a decision by Clinton when she was the Secretary of State to eschew the government’s e-mail system for a private one. In this hot summer of Donald Trump’s smash reality show and excited crowds for Clinton’s Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders, the e-mail imbroglio is giving her supporters indigestion. The headlines recall the bewildering, partisan-inflamed, and largely inconsequential controversies that surfaced during her husband’s Presidency—Whitewater, Travelgate, the Paula Jones case, the Monica Lewinsky matter, and, finally, President Clinton’s impeachment hearings. It was an era in Washington about which only white-collar defense lawyers may feel nostalgic.","1574","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Now the Clintons again confront a scrum of Republican congressmen and conservative activists who are clearly out to get them. Yet the tenacity of Republican opposition researchers does not by itself explain why Clinton and her husband are so often beset by accusation. Both of them too often co-author their dramas by obfuscating and tolerating conflicts of interest, such as when, between 2009 and 2013, with Hillary Clinton guiding American foreign policy, the Clinton Foundation accepted large donations from foreign governments, including several that abuse human rights.","1575","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"The e-mail case is, so far, a more ambiguous tangle. In late 2008 or early 2009, the incoming Secretary installed a private server at her New York home. She has said that she wanted to avoid carrying multiple e-mail devices, something that using the State Department system might have required. “What was supposed to be convenient has turned out to be anything but convenient,” Clinton remarked last week. Late last year, Clinton turned over to the State Department about thirty thousand e-mails from her home system. But, before doing so, she and her attorneys singled out more than thirty thousand other e-mails, which they deemed to be “private,” and, as far as is known, deleted them permanently. Clinton has said that the deleted notes concerned only “yoga routines, family vacations,” and the like. Her unilateral culling raised eyebrows, but her lawyers approved her action, and her assertion of privacy rights seems to have resonated with Democratic voters.","1576","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Now, however, the F.B.I. is involved. This is because an inspector general for U.S. intelligence agencies, and another for the State Department, reviewed a sample of Clinton’s e-mails and identified classified information in some of them. By near-automatic protocol, that finding was referred to the Justice Department. One of the F.B.I.’s tasks in the weeks ahead will be to look into whether, amid all the e-mailing to and from Secretary Clinton, any crime may have been committed, by anyone. There is no indication that Clinton is the target of a criminal inquiry.","1577","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Unfortunately for the candidate, though, the law around handling classified information can resemble a house of mirrors. The federal government routinely classifies many more documents than it needs to, including ones containing publicly known or harmless information. Consequently, government employees must treat subjects widely covered in the media, such as the fact that the U.S. carries out lethal drone strikes, as if they were super-secret. And even the most innocuous discussions with foreign government officials may be judged classified. This is often silly, yet the F.B.I. goes by the book. If Clinton and her aides swapped classified information over an unsecured e-mail system, they could be questioned about mishandling state secrets.","1578","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"That misdemeanor has ensnared several high office-holders in the recent past. In 2001, John Deutch, President Clinton’s second C.I.A. director, admitted to a single count of mishandling classified material, because he kept top-secret files at home on a Macintosh connected to the open Internet. (Bill Clinton pardoned him.) In 2005, Samuel Berger, a former Clinton Administration national-security adviser, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, because, after leaving office—for reasons that remain unclear—he removed classified documents from the National Archives and destroyed them. Earlier this year, General David Petraeus pleaded to a misdemeanor after allowing his mistress and biographer to read sensitive notebooks that he kept when he ran the C.I.A.","1579","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"In each of those cases, the evidence of serious or willful neglect was much clearer than anything that has emerged about Hillary Clinton’s e-mailing. It has not yet been independently determined whether any of the classified information in her correspondence was marked as such, for example, or how sensitive the secrets discussed might have been. Still, it is conceivable that more striking evidence of deception or serious neglect may eventually surface, and, in any event, the investigations will go on—and on and on, if past inquiries of this type are any guide.","1580","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Hillary Clinton’s vulnerabilities as a Presidential candidate are visible and often remarked upon—conspicuous wealth, a self-protecting style, and the baggage accumulated during three decades in public life. Her strengths are less often acknowledged. For one thing, she is a formidable campaigner—always on message, gaffe-free in debates and town halls, encyclopedic on policy, and comfortable with confrontation and competition. News cycles about faltering front-runners are as much a ritual of early primary seasons as eating pork on a stick at the Iowa State Fair. Hillary Clinton’s campaign is only starting. It will likely be another August before anyone can rate her chances to return to the temporally haunted living quarters she knew as a spouse, to take up rooms of her own. ♦","1581","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"

"In May, as David Letterman wrapped up more than three decades on the air, many people wrote about their experiences with Letterman and his show. I wanted to do something a little bit different: wait a while and then write about my experiences without Letterman and his show.","July 16, 2015","1596","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"I started watching Letterman at the end of junior high. It wasn’t a regular occurrence: I was little and it was late, and “Saturday Night Live” (which was on once a week at 11:30 p.m. rather than five times a week at 12:30 a.m.) was an easier sell to my parents. When high school arrived, with its starting time of seven-thirty in the morning, there was a drastic tapering off of nearly all post-prime-time viewing, except for the occasional Friday-night show. I saw enough Letterman to know the basics—the pet tricks, the high-concept suits—but I wasn’t watching with any regularity.","1597","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"Letterman returned to me, as he did for many people, in college. That’s when I attended religiously. The show meshed perfectly with college, both in the sense that it layered anarchy and irony over an undeniable work ethic and in the sense that it was easy to schedule classes a little later in the morning. Those years, the late eighties, were the glory years of the NBC show, the time when nearly every rule that governed the relationships between network and performer, and between performer and audience, was thrown out the window. Plenty of other things were thrown out the window as well, not to mention off the roof. For a half-decade or longer, I was watching perhaps ninety per cent of the shows, and I can remember many specific ones, from Lou Reed and Tim Reid (early 1989) to Larry King and some old guy who played the spoons (spring, 1991). There was a period when it seemed like Richard Simmons was on three times a month.","1598","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"After college, my relationship with the show changed. It happened to everyone I knew. Work, kids, and responsibilities came for us. Regular viewing of Letterman—what later came to be called “appointment TV”—slipped away, though there was a brief reunion in the final days of the NBC show and the first days of CBS, when late-night melodrama was thick in the air and Dave’s show was suddenly starting an hour earlier. The DVR era arrived, which theoretically renewed the possibility of watching, but that never really happened. The few times I taped the show and watched it the next day, it felt disorienting to the point of vertigo, some kind of cosmic cheat. Letterman was for late nights. How could you make sense of him with sunlight streaming in?","1599","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"And so I made my peace without Letterman—or rather, without watching him. I never doubted that he was there, and that gave me comfort enough. Even if I wasn’t watching, I knew that he was still puncturing self-important politicians in his monologue, still skewering celebrities in his interviews. I knew there were still loopy bits and skits. I didn’t know what they were, but that didn’t matter. Whenever anything happened that thrust Letterman or the show into the public eye—his heart surgery in 2000, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center the following year, the sex scandal in 2009—I watched more regularly for a little while, but it never lasted.","1600","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"When Letterman announced his retirement, I took it as a challenge to start watching again. I added a cup of coffee in the evening, as a booster, and tried to get back into the swing of things. Around the time I started staying up late again, I read a piece in the Times about the psychologist Ellen Langer, who, in the early eighties, isolated a group of elderly men and delivered to them a steady stream of pop culture from two decades prior. After only five days of immersion in Langer’s retro-tank, talking about old sports heroes and singing along to old music, the men not only felt younger, but performed better on tests. They had better manual dexterity. Their sight improved. Something like that happened to me when I recommitted to Letterman, but rather than my senses sharpening, my sensibility did. I woke up the next morning with shards of the show still lodged in my mind, which stayed with me in the course of the day. I saw the world a little differently: it was less claustrophobic, less calculated, less corporate. It wasn’t exactly the same experiment as Langer’s. It was impossible to confuse the elderly, bespectacled Dave of 2014 with the young man of the mid-eighties (when, I realized with shock, he was younger than I was when I returned to watching regularly). Still, the show was a blueprint for moving forward into the day, as much tonic as comic.","1601","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"The end approached. I braced myself. That final run of shows was everything I expected. It was celebratory and sad. At times, it was disappointing, but in the best way—many of the celebrity guests seemed to be using the show the way that I had, to inhabit their younger selves. Bruce Willis wore a wig that looked like his eighties hair. Jerry Seinfeld performed the same standup routine he had done in 1982. Right up to the end, Letterman maintained his longstanding and highly self-aware interest in anticlimax: the flattest show was the next-to-last one, with Bill Murray (who was warm and invested but not particularly funny) and Bob Dylan (who was cold and distant and, in his own way, hilarious).","1602","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"And then there was the last episode, the true finale. It’s not an exaggeration to say that I loved it. It filled me with love. And what does that mean in this context? That I felt that I understood it fully, right down to the randomness of the flashbacks, the sometimes awkward interactions with other celebrities, and the cheap but perfectly serviceable editing of the final video montage. It was just a normal slideshow, not overproduced, not overdone, intended to trigger memories rather than replace them. It felt like something that could have come from my high-school graduation banquet. In a sense, that’s exactly where it did come from.","1603","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"And then, no Dave. It’s been weeks. At first, I didn’t feel like giving up. I sought out old shows on YouTube, the older the better. I watched the first show, of course, the one with Larry “Bud” Melman’s creepy opening and Bill Murray and Mr. Wizard. I watched clips of Captain Beefheart and Brother Theodore and Cher and Professor Irwin Corey and Eddie Murphy and Teri Garr. I told myself that what I was doing wasn’t nostalgic but, rather, therapeutic, and I promised myself that I would reread the article about Ellen Langer’s study to make sure.","1604","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"I didn’t reread it. Instead, I started to understand that the show was never coming back. Reruns weren’t substitutes. They were stopgaps. Once or twice in the week of the final show, I turned on the TV at the time when Letterman was supposed to be on. Nothing was on—or, worse, some random episode of “The Mentalist” was. I watched about five minutes of it, unproudly. And then, just like that, I traded in mourning for molting. I stopped watching old shows. Suddenly, I didn’t want to relive Letterman’s past, or my past with Letterman. It was too painful, not to mention delusional. I wanted to keep just a few things, and let the rest go. And so, I tried. I tried to forget all the Chris-Elliott-as-Marlon-Brando sketches, all the Jay Thomas holiday specials, all the ill-advised experiments (Rerun Plus, especially, where they rebroadcast a sped-up version of the show so that they could cram in a bit of fresh content) and perfectly spiky interviews (Charles Grodin, mostly). I spent days trying not to remember but to forget.","1605","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"It was just an exercise, but it started to work. Things that were sharp dulled. Things that were in focus fogged. Only one skit survived all attempts at eradication. Dave was complaining, as he often did, about Lyme disease. He once said that he was worried that he had Lyme disease, not because of a tick bite but because a deer had jumped through the window and bit him on the head. I think this was a different Lyme monologue, but the point was the same: ticks were disease. Suddenly, a sandbag fell from above, narrowly missing Dave. He hurried backstage to see who was responsible. “Was it you?” he asked one stagehand, who professed innocence. “Was it you?” he asked another. That second stagehand also said no. Then he turned to one side, and the camera swung with him. “Was it you, Tick Boy?” he said to someone in a gigantic tick costume. Tick Boy shook his head.","1606","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"Last summer, during the time I started watching Letterman again, I had Lyme disease. It wasn’t a bad case. I went to a forest that had ticks in it, and one jumped up and bit me on the head, underneath my hair, where I couldn’t see it. I had a period of unexplained flu-like symptoms and took myself to the doctor. Lyme was diagnosed and treated with antibiotics. I have been told that there is recurrence of Lyme in fifteen per cent of the people who are treated for the disease. I am hoping that doesn’t happen to me. But I am hoping the opposite about the recurrence of Letterman. Life without the show is a dicey proposition. It seems boring, frankly—at worst, a world of panderers and manipulators delivering cant without challenge, and, at best, a long parade of earnest types who straightforwardly accept what the world gives them.","1607","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"Last week, Letterman briefly came out of retirement in San Antonio, Texas, of all places, at a comedy event featuring the perennial Letterman guests Steve Martin and Martin Short. His appearance was short and sharp, and he used the vast majority of it to mock Donald Trump. This, in itself, isn’t surprising. Everyone mocks Donald Trump. But not everyone mocks Trump the way Letterman did, with a mix of not-especially-edgy pop-culture references (there were four jokes about Trump’s hair, including “That thing on his head was the gopher in Caddyshack.”) and more pointed moral outrage (“Donald Trump looks like the guy in the life boat with the women and children.”). I was happy to have him back, if only for a moment. But I also felt that I had to start the process of loss all over again, which meant that it was going to take me longer to get to the final lesson—that Letterman’s absence isn’t just about a missing hour on TV. It’s also about forgetting that we all have to work a little harder to expose the world for what it is.","1608","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/life-without-letterman"
"“I can’t run again,” President Barack Obama said yesterday, speaking in Mandela Hall at the African Union headquarters, in Addis Ababa. “I actually think I’m a pretty good President—I think if I ran I could win.” Obama, at the end of what is likely to be his final trip to the continent as President, was addressing the habit that too many African leaders have of making themselves leaders for life. His message was that this was a bad idea, even if they, too, thought they were pretty good Presidents. But he may also have been thinking about tremors of the 2016 Presidential race, which had been making their way across the ocean. As yet, none of the Republican contenders has managed to look at once substantial, serious, and sane. In some cases (Trump), none of these attributes has been visible. And then there was the rush of alarming debate on the nuclear deal that the Obama Administration had concluded with Iran. This is where Mike Huckabee came in.","July 29, 2015","1609","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"“I have stood in that oven door,” Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, who is running for President, said on Fox News, on Monday. He was talking about a trip he had taken to Auschwitz, and also, by his reckoning, about the Iran deal. Over the weekend, Huckabee had said that the President “would take the Israelis and basically march them to the door of the oven” by agreeing to “the most idiot thing, this Iran deal.” That was a bit much, even for certain Fox personalities. Sitting across from Huckabee, Geraldo Rivera told him that he loved him and thought he’d be a great President, but that, as a Jew, speaking on behalf of his extended family—“the Levys, the Riveras, the Friedmans”—he was offended. Huckabee, who had just finished explaining why Obama was acting like Neville Chamberlain, another person who “did not take seriously threats that someone was going to kill massive amounts of Jews,” did not back down. If he wasn’t meant to compare the gas chambers to contemporary policy choices, “Why do we have the Holocaust museum?” Huckabee asked Rivera, whose mustache was quivering. If one is looking for a way to separate out the strands of extremism, theatre, and—maybe—serious policy discussion in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination, these people are not here to help.","1610","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"Huckabee also said, “When the President and Hillary Clinton are calling you out personally, must be a good day.” Both of them had taken issue with the oven line. Asked about the remarks during a press conference in Ethiopia, Obama said, “The particular comments of Mr. Huckabee are, I think, part of just a general pattern that we’ve seen that is”—here, he paused, as if trying to contain his mockery—“would be considered ridiculous if it weren’t so sad.” He noted, though, that Huckabee wasn’t alone: “We’ve had a sitting senator call John Kerry Pontius Pilate. We’ve had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I’m the leading state sponsor of terrorism. These are leaders in the Republican Party.” Those sitting senators are, respectively, Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, and Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Obama was not exaggerating the tone or the content of their statements. Cotton is the freshman senator who persuaded his colleagues to sign a “Dear Ayatollah” letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader, in a fairly open attempt to sabotage the negotiations. His comparison of the Secretary of State to the Roman official who is said to have allowed Christ to be killed was part of a complaint, on “Morning Joe,” about the International Atomic Energy Agency having drafted some of the details related to the inspections foreseen in the deal. “John Kerry acted like Pontius Pilate,” he said. “He washed his hands, kicked it to the I.A.E.A., knowing that Congress would not get this information unless someone went out to find it.” That “someone” was a certain intrepid senator from Arkansas, who was just back from Vienna, where he had gone to closely interrogate nuclear inspectors himself.","1611","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"Obama might have also mentioned Lindsey Graham, who called the deal a “death sentence” for Israel. Jeb Bush said of Huckabee’s Holocaust language, “Those types of words don’t help,” and that there was a need for candidates to be more “civil.” (He also called Trump “vulgar.”) But Bush has also called the deal “appeasement”—raising the question of whether he thinks that the civil thing to do is allude to Neville Chamberlain, rather than name him. Graham and Bush are running for President, too. Obama, in Ethiopia, noted that it was a noisy race: “Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines.” But Obama also wondered why certain unhinged comments crossed the line, and others didn’t. Trump was condemned across the board when he said that John McCain wasn’t a war hero, but, Obama said, “when outrageous statements like that are made about me, that a lot of the same people who were outraged when they were made about Mr. McCain were pretty quiet.” That might sound petty—Obama wasn’t kept prisoner by the Vietnamese for years, as McCain was—until one takes a look at what’s being said in the field. Trump has attacked Obama’s parentage, citizenship, intelligence, patriotism, and legitimacy as a President.","1612","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"Huckabee’s comments were so crude that they offended members of an Israeli government that has condemned the deal as, in Benjamin Netanyahu’s words, a “historic mistake.” (“Nobody marches the Jews to ovens anymore,” Yisrael Katz, the transportation minister, said, according to the Washington Post. “If need be, we will know how to defend ourselves, by ourselves.”) But, as with Trump’s attack on McCain, it was also a reminder of how much nonsense gets a pass in politics—of all the defamation that doesn’t get decried.","1613","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"The argument that the Administration is making is that it’s not just vulgar to compare the Iran deal to the Holocaust. It is false to say that it endangers Israel, given that, in the estimation of experts who have examined it, the agreement is the best chance out there to keep Iran from having a bomb. That is the fight Obama is returning to: Congress has sixty days to pass a resolution of disapproval, setting up a vote that would likely fall between the September 11th anniversary and the second Republican candidates’ debate. For the deal to survive, Obama needs just enough votes to sustain a veto. On Tuesday, in testimony before Congress, Kerry spoke forcefully and in detail about centrifuges and inspections, and listened as Republicans told him what they thought he didn’t know. Representative Scott Perry, of Pennsylvania, who had taken his suit jacket off to better wave his arms as he tried to decide whether Iran was “a crocodile or a shark,” spoke over Kerry. “If the Ayatollah doesn’t like it, oh, boo hoo. We’re here for America. You represent America,” the congressman said. “So do you care more about this deal and the U.N.’s approval, or America sovereignty?” Kerry responded, “Congressman, I don’t need any lessons from you about who I represent. I’ve represented and fought for our country since I was out of college. So don’t give me any lessons about that, O.K.?” Kerry did not appear to be about to wash his hands of anything.","1614","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"A remarkable thing almost happened to the two-party system in the summer of ’44: Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic President, about to be nominated for a fourth term, began a political flirtation with Wendell Willkie, the businessman Republican he’d defeated four years earlier, with the idea of forming a joint venture. No matter that, in 1940, Willkie had criticized the slowness of the economic recovery and, as Hitler’s Germany overran Europe, what he saw as American unreadiness. The two candidates had mostly agreed on big questions—above all, on sending military aid to Great Britain. Willkie’s sharpest criticism of F.D.R. focussed on his quest for a third term, a break with a two-term tradition that dated back to George Washington. “The doctrine of one man’s indispensability is a new doctrine for this country,” the Times editorial page noted, not approvingly, when the newspaper endorsed Willkie.","July 28, 2015","1615","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"As is still true today, party labels did not always mean what they seemed to mean. Willkie, a former Democrat, was never completely trusted by his party, though he had more in common with his 1944 primary competitors—Thomas E. Dewey, the New York governor; Harold Stassen, the former “boy governor” of Minnesota; even General Douglas MacArthur, the Pacific commander, whose vanity overcame his soldierly responsibilities—than many Republicans in this year’s free-for-all have with each other. Willkie quit the race in April, after Dewey won the Wisconsin primary, and Roosevelt was soon informed that Willkie was unhappy about being beaten by conservatives. More than that, F.D.R. told his special counsel, Samuel I. Rosenman, Willkie had been mulling “the possibility of a new setup in American politics.” Roosevelt, as Rosenman wrote in a memoir of his years at the White House, added that some Democrats “are out for my scalp, too”—referring to anti-New Deal sentiment in Texas and the South. “I think the time has come for the Democratic Party to get rid of its reactionary elements. … and to attract the liberals in the Republican Party. Willkie is the leader of those liberals.” It would have to be a long-term project, the President continued, “But we can do it in 1948, and we can start building it up right after the election this fall.” Roosevelt said that “Willkie and I together” could form this new party.","1616","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Roosevelt dispatched Rosenman to New York, where, secret-agent-style, he visited Willkie’s hotel suite and told him that Roosevelt “wants to team up with you.” Willkie was receptive and, on July 13th, even as F.D.R. was getting ready to ask Senator Harry Truman to be his running mate, he dictated a letter to Willkie saying, “I want to talk to you about the future, even the somewhat distant future, and in regard to the foreign relations problems of the immediate future.” This was a hard-to-keep secret. A headline reading “Willkie Asked by Roosevelt to Meet with Him” appeared in the August 11th edition of the New York Herald Tribune, followed by more stories, all suggesting that one topic would be the direction of the postwar world. Willkie’s initial reaction was “No comment,” while Roosevelt was at his most evasive, at first denying that the letter existed—which prompted an August 21st apology to Willkie—and then admitting that it was genuine. Willkie wrote, but never mailed, a letter to F.D.R. saying, “If it is agreeable with you, I would prefer postponement of any such talk until after the November election.” (Willkie was feeling pressure to support Dewey, his party’s nominee.)","1617","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"But this political serial ended abruptly when Willkie, on October 8th, died of a strep infection that spread to his heart. He was fifty-two. Six months later, Roosevelt, too, was dead, and so was his hybrid-party plot.","1618","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"It’s hard, though, to resist the thought that a new political force—a fusion party—might have been born that summer, that a Roosevelt-Willkie alliance, drawing on the moderate impulses of the major parties, might have planted roots and become a counterweight to an era like the present, when men and women professing all sorts of highly personal beliefs keep leaping into the Presidential race. Forget Donald Trump; just consider the “mainstream” Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, who announced his candidacy by saying, “We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed castle doctrine and concealed carry.” That sounded like a man running as a divider, not a uniter.","1619","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"A fusion party would accentuate coöperation, an urge present in 2004, when the Democrat John Kerry apparently asked the Republican John McCain to be his running mate. McCain said no, but the race would have been enthralling. President Eisenhower, in private, sometimes sounded off about breaking away from his party, and, when he contemplated dropping Richard Nixon from the ticket, in 1956, he considered asking the Ohio governor, Frank Lausche, a Catholic Democrat, to take his place. (Under very different circumstances, Abraham Lincoln, in 1864, took the border-state Democrat Andrew Johnson as a running mate.) Some possible alliances have gone unrealized—or unrecognized—because of party labels. On foreign policy, for instance, Hillary Clinton has often had more in common with the Republican Senator Lindsey Graham than with the Democrats Bernie Sanders or Jim Webb or, for that matter, Barack Obama.","1620","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"And, if it would have been too much to hope that, after the 2012 election, President Obama and a restless Mitt Romney could have discussed a centrist coalition, odd pairings can still happen. Obama and the Koch brothers, David and Charles, have managed to break through party barriers and ideology in the cause of criminal-justice reform.","1621","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Certainly, if Willkie and Roosevelt had lived and followed through, their venture might have seemed far-fetched. But a short-lived alliance might have demonstrated that in a divided nation—even one with sixteen Republican Presidential contenders running wild—there might be a path to that calmer center, where, polls suggest, most people still want to live.","1622","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"A few days before the Adam Sandler movie “Pixels” was released, Bob Chipman saw an advance screening. “I was bored within two minutes, angry after five, and by the time all hundred minutes had run out I was sad and numb,” he later said. Chipman, who is thirty-four and lives outside Boston, blogs about video games under the moniker the Game OverThinker and reviews films as MovieBob. (Tagline: “Film. Gaming. Politics. Geek.”) “Pixels” is an action-movie mashup of classic arcade games, such as Pac-Man. Chipman found the movie unequal to its subject matter. A few hours later, when his sadness had “simmered into pure, white-hot, pants-shitting rage,” he wrote down nineteen hundred words, read them into a microphone, paired the audio with a slide show and clips from the “Pixels” trailer, and posted the result on YouTube. “ ‘Pixels’ isn’t a movie,” Chipman says in the video. “It’s a motherfucking active crime scene, and the crime is cultural vandalism.” He goes on to describe the film as “a pile of skidmarked sumo thongs,” “a maggot-oozing head wound,” and a “waterfall of elephant jizz cascading into theaters this weekend.” He concludes, “Fuck everyone who made this movie.”","1623","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/harangue"
"Within a few days, the video had been viewed more than a million times and had attracted enthusiastic comments from the gamer set: “Best. Movie. Review. Ever.” “Preach it bro. As a nerd myself, I’m pissed.” “Marry me!”","1624","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/harangue"
"To some, MovieBob’s “Pixels” review isn’t a review at all; it’s a rant. The word comes from Shakespeare. Hamlet, at Ophelia’s funeral: “I’ll rant as well as thou.” Its meaning depends on the central question of the play: Is Hamlet raving mad, or is he making more sense than anyone else? This is the question we ask about our best ranters. In 2013 and 2014, Kanye West played stadiums in thirty-seven cities. For about ten minutes every night, he delivered an improvised performance that was part motivational speech, part critique of the fashion industry, and part off-the-cuff observations about water bottles and “The Hunger Games.” “I go off on these rants that don’t make any sense,” West recently acknowledged. “But I don’t give a fuck.”","1625","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/harangue"
"A. O. Scott, a film critic at the Times, conceded, last week, that the rant has its place. (He is about to publish a book, “Better Living Through Criticism,” that explores this idea, among others.) “There’s a long history—proud or ignominious, depending on how you look at it—of vicious hatchet-job reviews,” he said. No one much liked “Moose Murders,” a Broadway play that opened and closed on the same night, in 1983, but Frank Rich, in the Times, strafed it so gleefully—invoking, for example, the possibility that the hunting trophies onstage were moose that “committed suicide shortly after being shown the script that trades on their good name”—that he subsequently became known as the Butcher of Broadway.","1626","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/harangue"
"“There will always be people who say, ‘That went too far,’ ” Scott said. Last year, he saw “Blended,” another Adam Sandler movie. “I very quickly and angrily wrote up six hundred words,” Scott said. (Sandler might well be the great muse of the apoplectic pan.) “That afternoon, it was one of the biggest things on the Times site.” His review lamented the movie’s “sheer audience-insulting incompetence”; the PG-13 rating at the bottom warned, “It will make your children stupid.” Lindy West, who is working on a memoir called “Shrill,” may be best known for her 2010 evisceration of “Sex and the City 2,” a movie that, she wrote, “takes everything that I hold dear as a woman and as a human . . . and rapes it to death with a stiletto that costs more than my car.” West said that she now regrets some parts of the review: “I’m still offended by garbage art that wastes my time, but I now try to reserve my ire for things that deserve it.”","1627","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/harangue"
"Chipman, though, stands by his rant. “ ‘Pixels’ annoyed me for very specific reasons,” he said. As a child, he adored Pac-Man. “The younger version of me would have been so excited for this premise, and for them to do the worst possible version of it—as I said in the review, it felt like someone taking a shit in my house.” After his review went viral, Chipman was contacted by a talent agent who wants him to audition for voiceover work, “which has certainly never happened before.” But he is reluctant to self-identify as a ranter.","1628","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/harangue"

"In a scene midway through HBO’s “Show Me a Hero,” one that functions as a metonym for the series, a Yonkers city councilman named Hank Spallone—played with toothpick-chewing gusto by Alfred Molina—and a photographer drive through the Schlobohm housing projects. They’re hunting for images to inflame voters: lurid proof that poor black people come from “another culture.” But their presence also changes what they see. When their sedan lingers, two giggly teen-age girls go silent, then shoot their middle fingers up in defiance. Click goes the camera. Meanwhile, a weary older woman walks by, lugging groceries. The photographer raises his lens—but then doesn’t bother.","1636","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"Written by David Simon and Bill Zorzi, directed with unshowy simplicity by Paul Haggis, and based on the excellent nonfiction book by Lisa Belkin, “Show Me a Hero” is an attempt to refocus that picture—to find beauty in daily struggles and civic courage, not in bad-boy fantasies. The six-episode miniseries, set in the nineteen-eighties and nineties, is a dramatization of the battle to desegregate Yonkers, punctuated by swigs of Maalox. As anyone who followed the real-life story knows—don’t Google it if you don’t want spoilers—it has one happy ending and one very sad one. (The title comes from F. Scott Fitzgerald: “Show me a hero, and I’ll write you a tragedy.”) It’s the latest effort by Simon, the creator of “The Wire” and “Treme,” to forge an effective model for the message drama, with plots torn not from the headlines but from the op-ed page. Well cast, solidly structured, and emotionally stirring, the show is as sincere as the Bruce Springsteen songs that make up its score, a ballad of pragmatism with a passionate heart. And, no, that’s not code for “boring.” The series builds and deepens, stanza by stanza, and then it soars.","1637","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"To a large degree, this is because of Oscar Isaac, who plays Nick Wasicsko, in a star performance agile enough to elevate scenes that might veer into agitprop. When “Show Me a Hero” begins, Wasicsko, a former cop, a flirt in a thick Pacino mustache, gets picked by the Democrats to run for mayor, challenging the incumbent, who lost support over a judicial decree to build low-income housing. Wasicsko tells voters that he’ll fight the ruling, then wins big, becoming the nation’s youngest mayor. Only then must he face facts: any court appeal is doomed, and, anyway, would bankrupt the city. Somehow, he needs to make this unpopular plan work.","1638","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"Right away, the white residents who elected Wasicsko turn against him. Civic meetings boil over into near-riots. Former supporters spit in his face. They rock his car, then shatter the windshield—and these scenes, filmed in the locations where the events the show is based on occurred, feel wild and kinetic, placing us right in the action. But Wasicsko barrels forward. What begins as practicality evolves into spiny principle: he’s a dreamy realist, a civic puzzle-solver, which proves to be its own kind of idealism. He builds bridges as they get wiped out. As his troubles increase, Wasicsko’s eyes become wells of need: he’s diligent, canny, a good listener, but he’s hooked on adoration.","1639","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"The show’s wonkiest policy debates are also its liveliest scenes, as the white men who run the city wheedle to get that mysterious force worshipped by Donald Trump: leverage. In one scene, the city planner Oscar Newman (Peter Riegert, in an Amish beard) proposes scattering just a few town houses within each white neighborhood, to discourage the “criminal element.” An A.C.L.U. lawyer (the appealingly shaggy Jon Bernthal—few shows have made such a nostalgic case for men’s hair of the eighties) calls this racist. Newman doubles down, citing research. “Public-housing residents are no different than any other renters,” he argues later. “They will jealously guard and maintain what’s theirs.” He fights for specific features, like front yards facing the street. It’s clear that Simon and Zorzi are in Newman’s camp, which favors make-it-work facts over ideology, but the show also respects the debate’s prismatic quality: the judge has his priorities, as does HUD, as do the politicians hedging career bets. Even the bigoted residents, who cloak their fears in talk of property values, are flawed, human, and, in a few cases—as with one resident, played with warm humility by Catherine Keener—capable of change. It’s a dark take on politics, but a bright one on democracy.","1640","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"If the show has a weak spot, it’s in the depiction of Schlobohm, with its grim canyons of drug dealers and struggling families. In the first few episodes, we get glimpses of four black and Latina women, all single mothers: a teen-ager with a criminal boyfriend; a laborer yearning for the kids she left behind in the Dominican Republic; a young widow; and an elderly health aide gone blind (the terrific LaTanya Richardson Jackson). The performances are solid, the real-life details affecting, but the stories feel stiff, disjointed, their peripheral quality underlined by aesthetic choices. (Springsteen dominates, while hip-hop leaks through doors.) It’s only once we get to the housing lottery that these plots click: there’s uneasy power in a shot of the women’s closed faces beside their kids’ open giddiness, praying for a Golden Ticket, even if that means living among strangers who hate them. It’s an ugly numbers game, but it’s the only one in town.","1641","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"In interviews, Simon likes to call himself the “PBS of HBO.” And, truly, there’s something beautiful and Wasicsko-esque about his dogged desire for TV drama to reflect the best values of journalism. (He’s been working on “Show Me a Hero” since before “The Wire,” as the subject matter has become ever more relevant.) In an era of sociopaths and conspiracies that go all the way to the top, “Show Me a Hero” is less a breakthrough experiment than a refreshing throwback, echoing certain of the grittier, now forgotten network series of TV’s early decades, such as the social-worker procedural “East Side / West Side.” Simon’s shows are unashamed of their mission to educate and to illuminate, and, if advocating for them can make a critic feel as if she were hawking a standing desk, so be it.","1642","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"But Simon is wrong to suggest that, for viewers, the choices are Yonkers or zombies. The truth is, progressive politics are experiencing a TV boom these days—a revival of the medium’s do-gooder legacy—but they’re often nested in genres taken less seriously: comedies, shows aimed at women and teens, sci-fi. Take CBS’s deceptively procedural-shaped “The Good Wife,” which has explored, with surprising granularity, the risks of N.S.A. surveillance and the insidious effects of big money on Democratic politics. Or ABC Family’s teen soap “The Fosters,” so sharp on judicial issues for kids in the foster system. TV’s most nuanced explorations of health care are on BBC’s “Call the Midwife,” set among Anglican nurse-midwives after the Second World War, and HBO’s mordant black comedy “Getting On,” about a geriatric ward corroded by for-profit funding. The most vivid critique of capitalism since “The Wire” was HBO’s humane “Enlightened”; later, in an entirely different genre, USA’s sizzling dystopia “Mr. Robot” picked up that radical thread. These shows make left-wing arguments without the signifiers of TV seriousness: realism, male protagonists, big-name Hollywood directors.","1643","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"The most striking example is Jenji Kohan’s women’s-prison series, “Orange Is the New Black,” which is so tonally perverse that the Emmys can’t figure out whether it’s a comedy or a drama. The third season, currently streaming on Netflix, is both a scathing denunciation of the privatization of the prison system and a voice of advocacy for labor unions—though you’ll rarely hear it described that way. With its scenes of shower sex, “Orange Is the New Black” has got the side eye from those who prefer their prison politics straight, so to speak. The characters are demographic cousins of the women on “Show Me a Hero,” but they’re blown up, not life-size. Still, the show’s themes are right out of the Marshall Project: solitary confinement; the joke of a “job fair”; financial corruption, which leaves inmates literally flooded with excrement (a story that reflects a prison where the show is filmed); untreated mental illness; and the fraught “compassionate release” policy of removing elderly inmates. As Simon’s shows do, “Orange Is the New Black” draws from nonfiction: one plot, about a mother and daughter, feels inspired by Adrian Nicole LeBlanc’s “Random Family.” But the series rejects realism, mining instead an outrageousness that verges on the vaudevillian.","1644","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"The third season begins, in a few early, atypically weak episodes, as the Litchfield Prison is taken over by an outside company, a data-driven corporation of Amazonian proportions. Only gradually do we see the effects of the profit motive. Untrained guards are hired for cheap, while experienced ones become temps. The food is replaced with sickening gruel. “Orange,” too, has a brutal lottery scene, in which inmates are randomly assigned to a garment sweatshop. Most provocatively, the show draws parallels between the inmates and the guards, who are trying to unionize.","1645","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/little-boxes"
"The season’s richest story—a slow-motion collision between the Latina cook Gloria and the trans black hairdresser Sophia—was, on the surface, highly intimate and domestic, a story of mothers clashing. But “Orange” is always, damningly, about how institutions crush the illusion of the individual. In the season’s final episodes, Sophia winds up in solitary, punished “for her own protection.” You could tell her tragic story in many styles, bleak or arch, mythic or hyperrealist, and each of these approaches would be valuable, and provocative, in its own way. Authenticity is a useful goal, but it can take many forms.

But at a moment when many politicians would have stayed out of view, Christie stood there and talked, and talked, and talked, his very presence indicating that, however bad things got, he intended to tough it out.","July 1, 2015","1671","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"

Without a teleprompter or any notes, he spoke for about half an hour, casting himself as a working-class hero, a pragmatic problem solver, and, above all else, a teller of truths.","1672","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"
"“I am not running for President of the United States as a surrogate for being prom king of America,” Christie said. “I am not looking to be the most popular guy who looks in your eyes every day and tries to figure out what you want to hear. . . . When I stand up on a stage like this in front of all of you, there is one thing you will know for sure: I mean what I say and I say what I mean. And that’s what America needs right now.” Just in case anyone hadn’t received the message, his campaign had printed up blue placards bearing the legend “Christie.

"To be fair to the two-term governor, he had some good lines. (He often does.)

When he did get around to attacking the current Commander-in-Chief, he accused him of running a “weak and feckless” foreign policy, adding, “President Obama lives in his own world, not in our world.”","1674","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"

"And that’s the good news for Christie. On the national level, his position is even more fraught. It’s not just the fact that he’s running ninth in the G.O.P. field, or that fifty-five per cent of likely Republican voters questioned by pollsters for an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey said that they couldn’t even imagine voting for him, or that many of the wealthy Republicans who supported him in 2012 have moved on to other candidates.

Another twenty-three per cent said that they like him but dislike his policies.","1678","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"
"Obviously, the Bridgegate scandal played a big part in undermining Christie’s popularity. But he has also been plagued by economic problems, particularly in Atlantic City; questions about the use of Hurricane Sandy relief funds; and renewed problems with the state’s public-employee pension system, which he claimed to have fixed. “The bad news is that he is the governor in a state where a sizable majority give a thumbs down to his leadership,” Krista Jenkins, the Fairleigh Dickinson professor who directed the poll, said.","1679","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"
"Even some of Christie’s admirers have pretty much written him off. “His moment was four years ago, when he was fresh, brash—there was just something about him,” Charles Krauthammer, the conservative commentator, said on Fox News. “He was the candidate everybody wanted, the anti-Mitt Romney.

Ever confident of his own abilities, Christie will be looking for a strong showing in the televised debates, which start in August, and which will showcase his articulacy and his everyman persona. Still, absent a collapse in Bush’s campaign and a mass outbreak of amnesia among G.O.P. voters, Christie’s quest looks like a forlorn one.","1681","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-planet-is-chris-christie-living-on"
"It’s no spoiler to describe the crucial moment in “Best of Enemies,” Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville’s documentary about the debates between William F. Buckley, Jr., and Gore Vidal that were televised live during ABC’s broadcasts of the 1968 Democratic and Republican conventions. On August 28, 1968, in Chicago, during the Democratic convention, in the ninth of their ten debates, Vidal—who was more eager to reveal Buckley’s character than to deflate his ideas—called Buckley a “pro- or crypto Nazi,” and Buckley responded by calling Vidal a “queer” and threatening to “sock” him. It’s the moment when, as the film’s commentators suggest, Buckley knew that he had lost the debate. He not only lost his cool, he revealed exactly the prejudices that Vidal hoped to pin on him and, by extension, on conservative ideology.","August 17, 2015","1682","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"It’s noteworthy that Vidal himself—as Hendrik Hertzberg has written—wasn’t the one to Godwinize the argument. Rather, it was ABC’s newscaster and moderator, Howard K. Smith, who did so. The subject of debate was police conduct and misconduct toward protesters. Buckley argues that the protesters invited repression by chanting “sheer, utter obscenities,” as well as pro-Vietcong slogans. Vidal contends that, in doing so, the protesters broke no laws, and Smith responds to him: “Mr. Vidal, wasn’t it a provocative act to try to raise the Vietcong flag in the park in the film we just saw? Wouldn’t that invite a—raising a Nazi flag in World War II would have had similar consequences?”","1683","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"Vidal responds that many Americans opposed the war and thought that “the Vietcong are correct in wanting to organize their country in their own way politically.” Buckley pursues Smith’s line of argument, saying, “Some people were pro-Nazi, and the answer is that they were well treated by people who ostracized them, and I’m for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers.” That’s when Vidal responds, “As far as I’m concerned, the only pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself,” and Buckley responds, “Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I’ll sock you in the goddam face, and you’ll stay plastered.”","1684","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"What resulted was Buckley’s long retrospective view of the debate in Esquire magazine and Vidal’s response, a lawsuit and a countersuit. Despite Buckley’s own sense of regret at his outburst—a regret that, as the film shows, seems to have followed him to the end of his life—his public activity continued unabated, and his prominence and prestige increased. But as Vidal, in a filmed interview from around the time of the debates, makes clear, what was at stake at the time was the outcome of a “culture war” that is still being fought to this day.","1685","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"Vidal’s third novel, “The City and the Pillar,” from 1948, is about homosexual relationships. Vidal himself had sexual relations with men, and—though he never publicly identified himself as homosexual—he spoke freely about homosexuality and insisted on its recognition as utterly ordinary. In one clip shown in “Best of Enemies” (now in theatres nationwide, and expanding further this Friday), Vidal said that this novel was the first that “dealt very openly with homosexuality as being a perfectly normal sexual activity”; in another, earlier one, he says that “it is as natural to be homosexual as it is to be heterosexual, and the difference between a homosexual and a heterosexual is about the difference between somebody who has brown eyes and somebody who has blue eyes.”","1686","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"What Vidal teased out of Buckley, in the climactic moment of the debate, was the equivalent of sexual racism, the expression of a prejudice that, even if it was shared by many viewers at the time, was suddenly exposed as arbitrary, ugly, and rancorous. A view that had seemed to be that of the angels, as ratified by religious institutions, suddenly appeared to be a kind of sympathy for the devil.

Where a debate between two urbane intellectuals ought to have ushered in a golden age of elevated, rational discussion, it instead—due to the personal enmity to which the combatants gave voice—sparked the worst aspects of modern media, a debased version of political talk, the gladiatorial mudslinging that prevails in broadcasting today.","1688","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"Nonetheless, the merit of “Best of Enemies,” as well as its commercial success, depends upon a crucial ambivalence. Although Gordon and Neville don’t spare ABC, or, for that matter, Buckley and Vidal, for transforming political discussion into blood sport, they regard the unusual sophistication of such televised fare with admiration and nostalgia. The film looks longingly toward a time when sesquipedalian patricians such as Buckley and Vidal could even be considered for a network’s mainstream, prime-time broadcast. The problem, according to the filmmakers, is that Buckley and Vidal let their personalities and personal enmities take precedence over the issues and the forum and let the high-minded possibilities at hand degenerate into spectacle.","1689","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"Buckley and Vidal were a strange pair of participants. Despite Vidal’s prodigious literary imagination and Buckley’s editorial prowess, both were dinosaurs of the drawing room whose pseudo-patrician affectations rendered them instant parodies of intellectuals. Though they were on opposite sides of the political divide and the culture wars, they were both on the same side of American manners; they spoke with near-British accents; they flaunted their refinement and the opposite of down-to-earthness; they seem suspended in aspic. Though Vidal’s ideals of sexual freedom were of the times and even ahead of them, and though his sympathies lay with student protesters, his carefully crafted public persona was as profoundly inegalitarian, élitist, and old-fashioned as Buckley’s; his crystalline appearance appeared ready to shatter at the sound of an electric guitar. Both Vidal and Buckley looked as if they wore another suit beneath their suit. The youthful currents of the time seem never to have reached either man.","1690","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"Regardless of their vast intelligence, Buckley and Vidal performed on ABC not to gratify intellect but to signify it, like the orotund televised spokesman for classical-music highlights. Yet for all the negative implications for the future of television and the republic that Gordon and Neville derive from their invective-stuffed clashes, the movie offers a fascinating, unintended hint in the opposite direction. The filmmakers put onscreen a newspaper article written soon after the debates, headlined, “To Battle ABC, CBS to Increase Commentary Load.” A host of history-shrouded names follow, including Marya Mannes, Luigi Barzini, Malcolm Muggeridge, and Cleveland Amory, but the next column mentions another new broadcast that CBS was about to launch in the wake of the Buckley-Vidal debates: “60 Minutes,” which was first broadcast on September 24, 1968.","1691","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"ABC’s grand experiment with Buckley and Vidal didn’t so much result in worse discussion as it resulted in more discussion, because it revealed discussion to be something greater than its content. First, their debates revealed televised discussion to be, first and foremost, a form of television, and thereby induced executives to expand the formal boundaries of news broadcasting. Second, their debates revealed televised discussion to be a media event in a very peculiar and particular sense: an event that existed more for the benefit of other media people, for journalists and commentators, than for the general public. The clashes come off as an event that entered the echo chamber of the punditocracy, that piqued the interest and won the acclaim of journalists and commentators, who themselves defined its import and impact by the very fact of their noticing. It was mass media for an insider audience, intended to create not first-order popularity but buzz. That’s its distinctive post-modernity, and its enduring claim on attention.","1692","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/buckley-vidal-and-the-birth-of-buzz"
"There are countries in the world where the history has been so brutal, so humiliating, and so unreconciled, that it has become part of the national iconography—sometimes to a degree that can startle foreign visitors. Bolivia’s President, Evo Morales, luridly underscored this point during Pope Francis’s recent visit there. In a ceremony that was held in front of television cameras, Morales handed the Pope the gift of a wooden crucifix made in the shape of a hammer and sickle. The Pope received the object politely, but he appeared wary. (In remarks he made later, the Pope claimed he had not been “offended” by the crucifix, while Morales explained that his gift had been offered “out of love” for the man he called “the Pope of the poor.”)","July 17, 2015","1693","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"The crucifix turned out to have been a specially commissioned replica of one made by the late Luís Espinal Camps, a left-wing Spanish priest and filmmaker who was murdered in La Paz, in 1980, by a Bolivian-government death squad. The killers gruesomely tortured Espinal before shooting him to death in a slaughterhouse. Since assuming office in 2006, Morales has championed the priest, who espoused the Marxist-influenced brand of Catholic activism known as liberation theology, as a national martyr.","1694","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"Upon his arrival in La Paz, Pope Francis dutifully halted his motorcade at the spot where Espinal was killed, to offer prayers on his behalf. He said that the priest had been murdered “by those who did not want him to fight for freedom in Bolivia.” It was an allusion to a period that carries dark resonations for the Catholic Church in Bolivia and across Latin America.","1695","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"Two days after Espinal’s murder, El Salvador’s outspoken Archbishop Óscar Arnulfo Romero, who similarly spoke out against injustice and on behalf of the poor, was celebrating Mass when he was assassinated by a sniper acting on the orders of a right-wing death squad linked to his own country’s military and private sector. In a move toward his eventual sainthood, which Pope Francis actively supported, Romero was beatified in a ceremony in San Salvador in May. In Bolivia, there are similar calls to beatify Espinal.","1696","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"Espinal and Romero were merely two of the most prominent religious figures in Latin America who, having been largely abandoned by the Vatican, fell victims to the anticommunist witch hunt that took place in the region during the nineteen-seventies and eighties. Tens of thousands died in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Paraguay during Operation Condor, a transnational murder campaign that was carried out by those countries’ militaries and their civilian accomplices—a scheme concocted by General Augusto Pinochet’s regime after he seized power in Chile, in 1973, and embarked on a bloody purge of the country. The terror campaign was soon adopted by fraternal ideologues in Central America. As in South America, priests and nuns in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras suspected of leftist sympathies were placed high on the target lists.","1697","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"Espinal was the first victim on a death list of names that was drawn up by the right-wing military dictatorship then ruling Bolivia. His killers operated under the orders of the country’s interior minister. They called themselves Los Novios de la Muerte—The Bridegrooms of Death. Los Novios were led by a number of international fugitives, including the neo-fascist Italian terrorist Stefano Delle Chiaie. The Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, who had been living in Bolivia since 1951, for much of that time more or less openly, was also closely associated with Los Novios.","1698","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"Morales, in his meeting with the Pope, wore a badge that displayed a photograph of the late Argentine revolutionary Ernesto (Che) Guevara. Guevara was executed in Bolivia in 1967, on the orders of the country’s military President, in an operation that was overseen by C.I.A. agents. Since becoming President, in 2006, Morales, a former leader of Bolivia’s coca-grower’s union and a protégé of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, has resurrected Che to the status of a national hero, hanging a portrait of him, fashioned out of coca leaves, in his office. In such ways, Morales has made it a central feature of his Presidency to challenge everything that he perceives as the status quo in Bolivia.","1699","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"As an ethnic Aymara (one of Bolivia’s two main indigenous groups, who make up two thirds of the country’s ten million people),Morales perhaps has more demons to exorcise, in his relations with the Vatican, than most other Latin American leaders. He is the first indigenous citizen to wield power in Bolivia, a country traditionally ruled by members of its minority mestizo or white population, who are descended from European settlers. The Church played a prominent role in the colonial history of Bolivia, which was one of the most cruelly exploited countries in Latin America. Bolivia remains poor and has been extremely volatile, with almost two hundred coups and revolutions since it won its independence from Spain, in 1825. Today, Bolivia is South America’s second-largest producer of natural gas, after Venezuela, and the world’s second-largest producer of cocaine, after Peru and before Colombia.","1700","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"Morales has made anti-Yankeeism a trademark of his time in office. He has reinforced this posture in various ways. In 2008, he severed Bolivia’s coöperation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and threw out the U.S. Ambassador—who still has not been replaced. Like many of his fellow-leaders, Morales has also overseen the creation a new constitution, which enshrines the rights of the country’s indigenous majority. He has also replaced Catholic rites at official ceremonies with indigenous Andean ones and nationalized the country’s gas reserves.","1701","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"In remarks he made during his stay in Bolivia, the Pope inveighed against unbridled free-market capitalism as a “new colonialism” that encouraged materialism, despoiled the environment, and created inequality. And he went out of his way to apologize, on behalf of the Catholic Church, for the “many grave sins committed against the native peoples in the name of God” during the “so-called conquest of the Americas.” It was an echo of something that Pope John Paul II had said on a visit he made to the country back in the eighties, but which, in places like Bolivia, bears repeating.","1702","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"At the time, Pope John Paul II also warned his priests to fight against the spread of evangelical Protestantism, which had begun to undermine the Catholic Church in many parts of Latin America. In the intervening years, that process has continued apace, as Pope Francis knows all too well. Indeed, if the Catholic Church is to have any relevance in Latin America a half century from now, it needs a makeover, and that includes a demonstrable new sense of humility on the part of its ecclesiastical authorities.","1703","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"Pope Francis, who was born in Argentina, knows how to talk in a language that is not simply a replay of liberation theology. During his trip, which included visits to Ecuador and Paraguay, he repeatedly invoked the idea of a “Patria Grande,” a great Latin American homeland, brought about through greater social, political, and economic unity. Such appeals for unity have been made in the recent past by the likes of Fidel Castro and Hugo Chávez, but they have their origins in the stirring rhetoric of Latin American independence heroes such as José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar.","1704","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"Notably, Pope Francis was a crucial figure, behind the scenes, in the recent secret diplomatic rapprochement between the United States and Cuba. In May, Cuba’s President Raúl Castro, a lifelong communist, went to the Vatican to see Francis and remarked, “If the Pope continues to speak like this, sooner or later I will start praying again and I will return to the Catholic Church—and I’m not saying this jokingly.” Evo Morales, for his part, said, “For the first time in my life, I feel like I have a Pope—Pope Francis.”","1705","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"But it is not only the leftists of Latin America who see something in the pontiff. Paraguay’s conservative President, Horacio Cartes, was equally effusive, lauding him for “his direction [that] lights the way and also gives us a grand task: to work together, with sacrifice and perseverance, so that we might have a country that is more equal for all.”","1706","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"At a time when Latin America lacks a popular unifying figure, Pope Francis has emerged as a leader with broad authority, someone who cuts across all the usual boundary lines. In a region that is now largely democratic and full of creative energy and portent, but is nonetheless still rife with social problems and political and economic contradictions, his is an intriguing presence—as familiar, somehow, as it is unexpected.","1707","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pope-of-latin-america"
"On April 11, 2012, in the middle of the Presidential campaign season, I watched Lil B, a performer whose medium is a hybrid of rap and Internet performance art, give a lecture at N.Y.U. He spoke about everything, which is to say nothing. That day, Mitt Romney had held a rally in Hartford, Connecticut (“If I’m the next President of the United States, I will go to work to get American women good jobs”), and President Obama had delivered remarks in support of the Buffett Rule (“In a perfect world, none of us would have to pay any taxes … but this is the real world that we live in”). Lil B’s lecture felt more interesting, if not more important, than a campaign speech. The lecture hall brimmed with excitement; there were many spontaneous bursts of applause. “Ay, bro, I’ma tell you the real secrets of life, bro,” Lil B said. “Look at everybody like they’re a baby.” I think he announced his intention to run for President, or maybe somebody in the audience asked him to make such an announcement and he declined. I can’t remember, honestly, and it doesn’t much matter. For those of us in the room, and for those who read about it on the blogs the next morning, it was a Moment.","August 31, 2015","1708","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/kanye-west-for-president"
"‪Kanye West’s acceptance speech at the Video Music Awards last night was a bigger Moment, on a bigger stage. That his rhythms reminded me of Lil B’s, down to the hypnotic repetition of the word “bro,” is no knock on West; the job of every great pop artist is to be a vector through which niche becomes mainstream. West was onstage for about twelve minutes, but for many of those minutes he merely basked in applause, wasting MTV’s airtime while exhibiting dozens of microexpressions: pensive, humbled, defiant, terrified. When he finally spoke, his remarks were, as we have come to expect from him, extemporaneous and disjointed and thrilling to watch. He is a captivating speaker, using his timing and his vocal timbre, as well as his words, to coax distant media consumers from indifference to passion. For a decade now, West has made a habit of saying exactly what he wants to say on live television. He calls this “turning up”; some fans call his speeches “visionary streams of consciousness”; most people call them rants. “I still don’t understand award shows,” he said last night, while demonstrating that he understands them better than anyone. His eyes watered and his voice caught in his throat. Twelve minutes in, we hadn’t learned much, except that he still holds grudges about the 2007 Grammys and that he is not finished picking fights with country stars. Then he said, “I have decided, in 2020, to run for President,” dropped the mic, and walked off stage.","1709","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/kanye-west-for-president"
"‪Was this announcement premeditated? Probably not, or he would have put his phrases in the right order. What would a Kanye candidacy mean? Not much—just another entry in the long tradition of stunt campaigns, and hardly the most implausible. (It would, at the very least, be a boon for the think-piece industry.) Will he really run? My guess is that he won’t, but, again, it doesn’t much matter. Among his many talents is his ability to pierce through media monotony, to seem vital when everything else seems predictable—to give people a good reason to watch live television. Right now, there might be no one—arguably not even Obama—who is better at this than Kanye West.","1710","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/kanye-west-for-president"
"‪Some people would argue that to call this a talent is to elevate it undeservedly. Such pop-culture Moments, according to this view, are mere distractions from what Obama called “the real world.” The historian Daniel J. Boorstin, writing in 1962, called these Moments “pseudo-events.” “I remain confident,” he wrote, “that what most dominates American experience today is not reality.” In 2015, popular culture, for better or worse, has swallowed everything, including politics. If the result—Donald Trump, Deez Nuts, and all the rest of it—is an embarrassment, then we should be embarrassed, but we should not be in denial. This is the only reality we have.","1711","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/kanye-west-for-president"
"I believe that elections have consequences, and that the President’s tax plan matters more than Lil B’s tax plan. I believe that the work of gradually improving public policy is boring and frustrating and crucially important. And yet I also believe that something real is happening when Kanye West, in the process of saying essentially nothing, brings himself to tears and a crowd to its feet. Rap concerts, political rallies, acceptance speeches at awards shows—all are opportunities to deliver rhetoric with such incantatory power as to generate a response from the audience. Some of this rhetoric may be empty; some is substantial. When West said, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people,” and when Obama sang “Amazing Grace” at Clementa Pinckney’s funeral, they were performing the nation’s catharsis in a way that transcended the usual bromides. But, even when less is at stake, and even when a politician is relying on hollow slogans or a rapper is deploying silly wordplay, the passion they stir in an audience can feel just as momentous.","1712","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/kanye-west-for-president"
"Presidents, once in office, operate within a narrow band of possibility. They tend to veer toward centrism; their verbiage might have the opposite of its intended effect, if it has any effect at all. When all is said and done, it might be the ability to generate Moments—“Ask not what your country can do for you”; “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall”; Obama’s speech in Selma—that defines a President’s legacy, more than any set of personal beliefs. Kanye West might not be Presidential—for one thing, he cares far too much about the Grammys, a pseudo-event if ever there was one. But if I were a Presidential candidate I would be jealous of Kanye’s knack for making the average American feel things.","1713","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/kanye-west-for-president"

"But, as Easterbrook pointed out, “the Supreme Court has stated repeatedly that, although the First Amendment protects truly independent expenditures for political speech, the government is entitled to regulate coordination between candidates’ campaigns and purportedly independent groups.” What the Court has yet to do is say what “coordination” means. Those who believe that money equals speech, and that American democracy is strengthened when money floods politics, are intent on persuading courts to do what the Wisconsin Supreme Court did: define what coördination covers as narrowly as possible, thus allowing a lot of coördinated advocacy by putting it outside the limits of the law.","1733","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"To understand how the Wisconsin court came to this decision, Gableman is the ideal justice to focus on. As an undistinguished county trial judge, he was recruited by business organizations to run against Louis Butler, a liberal and the court’s only black member, in the 2008 election. He narrowly won, giving the conservatives a majority, in a campaign so ugly that the Wisconsin Judicial Commission brought charges against Gableman for “reckless disregard for the truth.” He had run TV ads that gave the false impression that Butler had tried “to put criminals on the street.” (In two reviews of the charges, Gableman was not sanctioned for reasons better explained by politics than logic.)","1734","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"According to the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal watchdog group in Wisconsin, Gableman would not have been elected without the support of Wisconsin Club for Growth, the state arm of the national Club for Growth, and Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state chapter of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These two groups spent a total of $2.75 million on so-called issue ads during the campaign, more than five times what the Gableman campaign spent. They are, as the center noted, the “same groups that allegedly coordinated with Walker and brought the challenge to these coordination rules.”","1735","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"The special prosecutor formally asked Gableman to recuse himself from deciding the case about the John Doe investigation, based on the well-established principle that a judge should disqualify himself if his impartiality can be reasonably questioned. (The prosecutor also asked that another justice recuse himself, for the same reasons.) But under a recusal rule proposed by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, among other groups, and adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, in 2009, by a 4–3 conservative-liberal split, a justice need no longer recuse himself because he received campaign contributions from, or was the beneficiary of, “independent” spending by a person or group seriously affected by the case.","1736","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"Someday, a novelist with Wisconsin roots will tell the story of Walker’s engagement in squalid politics—and whether it carried him to the White House. Now, however, it is possible to document the close ties between the national network of major conservative donors backing Walker and the conservative lobbying groups that turned the Wisconsin court into a political tool, which forfeited much of its remaining legitimacy with last week’s ruling.","1737","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"Court documents unsealed last August include:","1738","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"An April 28, 2011, e-mail from Kate Doner, a fund-raising consultant to the Walker campaign, to R.J. Johnson, a top adviser to Walker, his campaign, and Wisconsin Club for Growth. “As the Governor discussed,” Doner wrote, “he wants all the issue advocacy efforts run thru one group to ensure correct messaging. We had some past problems with multiple groups doing work on ‘behalf’ of Gov. Walker and it caused some issues. In Wisconsin, a 501(c)(4) is the legal vehicle that runs the media/outreach/GOTV campaign. The Governor is encouraging all to invest in the Wisconsin Club for Growth. Wisconsin Club for Growth can accept Corporate and Personal donations without limitations and no donors disclosure.”","1739","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"A June 20, 2011, e-mail to Walker from Kelly Rindfleisch, who coordinated fund-raising by Walker on behalf of Wisconsin Club for Growth, with an itinerary for a fund-raising trip, background on donors he was scheduled to meet, and talking points. “Stress that donations to WiCFG are not disclosed and can accept corporate donations without limits,” Rindfleisch wrote, and “let them know that you can accept corporate contributions and it is not reported.”","1740","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"A September 7, 2011, e-mail from Doner to Walker, Johnson, Rindfleisch, and Keith Gilkes, who ran Walker’s 2010 campaign to be governor, became the governor’s chief of staff, and was a senior adviser to the 2012 recall campaign, containing “quick thoughts on raising money for Walker’s possible recall efforts.” Doner suggested the following for Wisconsin Club for Growth: “Take Koch’s money.” “Get on a plane to Vegas and sit down with Sheldon Adelson. Ask for $1m now.” “Corporations. Go heavy after them to give.”","1741","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, “The club received large checks from donors soon after Walker was advised to solicit funds from them for the group”: two hundred and fifty thousand dollars from Paul Singer, a billionaire and hedge-fund manager; a hundred thousand dollars from the giant manufacturing company MacLean-Fogg; fifty thousand dollars from the trust of David W. Hanna, the chairman and C.E.O. of FHP Wireless; fifty thousand dollars from the billionaire and former hedge-fund chairman Bruce Kovner; fifty thousand dollars from Devon Energy Corporation, a Fortune 500 company in the oil and natural gas business; fifteen thousand dollars from Ken Langone, the billionaire and investor; and fifteen thousand dollars from Donald Trump. A document showed that a month after Walker met with someone who worked at S.A.C. Capital Advisors, the billionaire Steven A. Cohen, who founded and ran the firm, gave the club one million dollars. (Documents from the investigation also show other donations and can be found at SourceWatch.)","1742","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"In the 2012 recall election, Wisconsin Club for Growth spent $9.1 million. It also gave more than $2.5 million to Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, which spent $4.7 million promoting Walker and attacking his opponent in that campaign. These groups also spent more than ten million dollars while promoting the conservative majority of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and attacking their opponents. There is no apparent difference in how the groups approached the Walker campaign and the campaigns of the conservative justices. Ostensibly about issues, ads they paid for in the campaigns were about politics, and the candidates the groups backed or attacked.","1743","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"The highly political nature of the election, or reëlection, of the court’s conservative justices, between 2007 and 2013, and the highly political nature of their rejection of the traditional recusal rule have for half a decade made the court vulnerable to charges that it has become a political body. With their decision to halt a major criminal investigation of the sitting governor, who is running for President, and to do so by gutting the state law regulating campaign finance, the conservatives have confirmed the weight of those charges.","1744","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"
"The decision may well be devastating not only to Wisconsin but also to the prospect of any effective regulation of national campaign contributions. As the Center for Media and Democracy explained, “All indications are that proponents of more secret money in politics aim to use the ‘John Doe’ case nationally, to argue against any campaign finance regulation whatsoever, and to intimidate regulators from enforcing the laws that remain on the books.”","1745","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-walkers-wisconsin-and-the-end-of-campaign-finance-law"

"Regardless of his future actions, Obama’s detente with Cuba and Iran will likely tarnish his legacy forever, Dorrinson said. “On this President’s watch, America lost two of its most enduring foes,” he said. “He’s going to have to live with that for the rest of his life.”","1750","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/obama-squandering-americas-precious-supply-of-enemies"
"For observers of Joe Biden—and anyone who wonders whether he will challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Presidential nomination—there was a small, telling moment in April, 2014, during a routine interview with “CBS This Morning.” Vice-President Biden and President Barack Obama were side by side when the reporter, Major Garrett, asked about the 2016 race. Biden gave the ritual denials (“If I decide to run, this is the first guy I’d talk to, but that decision hasn’t been made”) before Obama lavished praise upon him as “a great partner in everything I do.” Then Obama began to talk about someone else: “I suspect that there may be other potential candidates for 2016 who have been great friends and allies. We’ve got an extraordinary Secretary of State who did great service for us, for me and Joe.” Biden looked away, then back to the President, with a strained smile. It was no endorsement of Hillary Clinton. It was nothing—unless you want to know how Joe Biden makes decisions.","August 4, 2015","1751","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"Over the weekend, Biden supporters sent up a trial balloon to see what the world would think of the Vice-President joining the race. Maureen Dowd reported that, shortly before Beau Biden, the Vice-President’s eldest son, died of a brain tumor, in May, he encouraged his father to run. Some of Biden’s advisers have been contacting uncommitted Democratic donors, seeking to test their ability to marshal a campaign in a hurry, to measure Clinton’s vulnerability, and to see whether Biden might tap the evident desire for a non-Clinton option, which has fuelled the surprising early success of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.","1752","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"Reaction to the Biden prospect has been polite but practical. My colleague Ryan Lizza asked where Biden’s advantage over Clinton was in various areas—youth, gender, broad party support, “lefty cred,” money, and campaign strength—and found none. There was a time when Biden (who is almost five years older than Clinton) thought he had an angle, at least on lefty cred. Early last year, he began to stake out a populist economic appeal, telling a United Auto Workers audience, “You guys are the only guys keeping the barbarians at the gates, man.” He warned that conservatives have launched “a concerted, full-throated, well-organized, well-financed, well-thought-out effort waging war on labor’s house.” Since then, Sanders has staked out that territory, leaving Biden less room to maneuver.","1753","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"But another factor that, for the moment, weighs against a Biden run has more to do with his chemistry than with his competition. While reporting a Profile last year, I heard him return over and over to matters of respect. His father, Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr., was a car salesman who quit a stable job because his boss was imperious. One of Biden’s old-world, Scranton sensibilities is that he never forgets who afforded him respect and who withheld it; he still talks about the grade-school students who humiliated him for a childhood stutter, and his aides learn quickly that Biden hates nothing more than embarrassment. A former adviser recalled prepping Biden to ask a European leader for a favor; when the leader unexpectedly said no, Biden froze: “He hangs up the phone, and he’s like, ‘Don’t ever set me up like that again. It’s O.K. if we can’t move the ball; I’ll still make the call, but you’ve got to tell me.’”","1754","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"As a candidate, Biden would have to contend, once again, with the plagiarism scandal that drove him out of the 1988 race, and, given the choice between spending the next year as a trusted Vice-President or a third-time candidate trailing Hillary Clinton, Biden would likely be reluctant to subject himself to it. Then again, if that changes—if Clinton’s favorability drops sharply, or if she looks wounded, don’t expect Biden to defer to her (or to Bernie).","1755","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"If Biden doesn’t run, his greatest assist to his party will be if he can help Clinton find a way to leverage his most enduring asset: his willingness to express the kind of authentic emotion that is rare in American politics. It is a cliché to note that Clinton’s strongest moment as a candidate came in 2007, when she choked up before voters in New Hampshire, but it’s still true. Biden generates that kind of connection with people more frequently—often outside of public view. In “Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland,” two women who were kidnapped by the school-bus driver Ariel Castro and later escaped recalled meeting Biden at the White House. Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus thought that they were there for a quick grip-and-grin. He sat with them for forty-five minutes, and then invited them to lunch—while he pushed off other meetings and told them about the car accident, in 1972, that killed his wife and daughter. In their memoir, written with the journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, Berry recalled the encounter:","1756","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"In his speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, he said, “Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.” In the end, the only trait in Bidenworld that matters nearly as much as respect is perseverance.","1757","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"

"On the night of October 11, 2012, Barack Obama loped across the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, looking as if he were trying hard not to grin. It was a change of mood; eight days earlier, he had done poorly in his first Presidential debate with Mitt Romney, and the feeling in his campaign was gloomy. But, that evening, Vice-President Joe Biden had had his first debate with Paul Ryan, during which he called out the Romney campaign on its “malarkey.” Some commentators thought that he had looked foolish—he’d laughed a lot, and when Biden laughs, he throws back his head. (Mark Salter, the Republican operative, called the Obama-Biden debate combination “sleepy cop/crystal-meth cop.”) But even many of the critics thought that he’d won. He had reminded a lot of people of why they wanted a Democrat in the White House, particularly on questions like income inequality. One of those people seems to have been Obama himself. He’d watched the debate on Air Force One and, though there wasn’t a plan for him to speak to reporters, he swung over to where they were standing.","June 12, 2015","1821","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"“I’m going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight,” the President said. “I could not be prouder of him. I thought he made a very strong case. I really think that his passion for making sure that the economy grows for the middle class came through. So I’m very proud of him.”","1822","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Obama also seemed, in the days to come, more proud of himself. Having Biden with him on the ticket in 2012 helped him win and, it seemed, helped make him a better President when he did. That was the case when what was scoffed at as yet another instance of Bidenic indiscipline—getting ahead of his boss by saying that he was “absolutely comfortable” with full legal recognition of same-sex marriage—led Obama, too, to say what he actually believed, and arrive at a place where he felt proud to be.","1823","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The idea that a person could make those around him better came up again this past weekend, when Obama delivered the eulogy for Biden’s son, Beau, who had died of brain cancer, at the age of forty-six. The Vice-President, by all accounts, was hit hard by his son’s death. In 1973, he had taken his Senate oath next to the hospital bed where Beau lay, at age three, after surviving the car crash that had killed Biden’s wife and daughter. He was also the son who had served in the reserves in Iraq, been elected as the attorney general of Delaware, and one day, perhaps, could go even further in politics than his father had. “He even looked and sounded like Joe, although I think Joe would be first to acknowledge that Beau was an upgrade—Joe 2.0,” Obama said. He added, “That’s who Beau was. Someone who cared. Someone who charmed you, and disarmed you, and put you at ease. When he’d have to attend a fancy fund-raiser with people who took themselves way too seriously, he’d walk over to you and whisper something wildly inappropriate in your ear.” (Joe Biden, for his part, has been known to whisper wildly inappropriate things, but when he was, for example, caught on an open mic telling Obama that the passage of the Affordable Care Act was “a big fucking deal,” he was reminding Obama that he should take something seriously.) At the funeral, Obama said that he loved Biden. The two have a weekly lunch; the most recent one was on Wednesday, Biden’s first day back at work since Beau’s death.","1824","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"But Obama is almost done being President. Who else can Biden make better? Put another way, why doesn’t Biden run for President in 2016? Hillary Clinton may not want him to. But it might do her good, even if she is, as everyone says, the inevitable candidate. And it can only make the Democratic Party better.","1825","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Last year, Evan Osnos spoke to the Vice-President for a New Yorker Profile, and, Osnos wrote, “I asked Biden how he will respond if opponents say he is too old to be President. ‘I think it’s totally legitimate for people to raise it,’ he said. ‘And I’ll just say, Look at me. Decide.’ ’’ Biden is seventy-two. Hillary Clinton is sixty-seven. More tellingly, Biden added, “I watched my father. I made a mistake in encouraging him to retire. I just think as long as you think you can do it and you’re physically healthy….”","1826","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The Clintons have become very wealthy as a result of their book deals, speaking fees, and other endeavors—they have made thirty million dollars just since Hillary left the State Department. (Bill Clinton recently said that he would consider giving up paid speeches—after Hillary wins.) Joe Biden is not a very wealthy man. By one estimate, his net worth is between thirty-nine thousand and eight hundred thousand dollars; by another, with his mortgage figured in, it is a negative number. (Biden: “But I got a great pension and I got a good salary!”) Which way does that cut, for each of them? Perhaps it makes a Biden campaign less feasible, in that he has less flexibility; it might also make it more desirable, depending on one’s definition of independence.","1827","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Last week, Hillary Clinton almost lost to Bernie Sanders in a Wisconsin straw poll (the tally was forty-nine per cent to forty-one), but Sanders, who can reasonably be called a socialist, is not likely to be the one who makes clear what her real general-election vulnerabilities are, or how to overcome them. Biden would. He may have no chance of winning. But he is a more plausible candidate than anyone Clinton is facing now, and perhaps the best answer to the fear that, as the Republicans fight it out among themselves, she will drift through until the convention, with a stray glance at Martin O’Malley, and enter the general election unprepared for the fight. Obama was right about Biden’s debate with Ryan: rewatching it is a good reminder of his ability to speak plainly and in detail about Democratic economic policies—something that involves more than just throwing out lines about level playing fields. (Republicans have been doing that, too.) Maybe Hillary Clinton, in a speech she’s scheduled to give on Saturday, will find a way to make those themes work for her. She hasn’t yet.","1828","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"And, although she served four years as Secretary of State, Biden has a deeper background in foreign policy, with years as a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a skepticism about things like troop deployments that might appeal to noninterventionists—who can be found across the spectrum. His 2006 proposal for Iraq—reshaping the country into a loose three-part federation—also much derided, does not, in light of recent events, look all that bad. (As it is, a sectarian Shiite-dominated central government unwilling to give a voice or commit resources to Sunni and Kurdish regions has contributed to the rise of ISIS.)","1829","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"But how, might one ask, could Biden win in a general election when Obama, his boss, is so unpopular? That question points to what may be one of the most interesting results of having Biden in the race. Hillary Clinton would have to decide where she really stands on the Obama Presidency, in all its aspects, and say what she thinks about it. (He was her boss, too.) Her advisers have made it clear that she’s counting on the Obama coalition; how tied are their votes to the Obama legacy? Clinton needs a response that doesn’t just involve hinting that everything would have been better if she’d been elected in 2008. She tried out some jabs at Obama, in an interview with the Atlantic last August, in which, quoting one of his mantras, she said, “Great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” and called his choices on Syria a “failure.” Her spokesman said afterward that she hadn’t meant to criticize the President, and looked forward “to hugging it out.” The message there, whatever it was, got muddled. Biden’s presence might clarify it, and present some interesting choices to Democratic primary voters—and to Obama, who might not endorse anyone before the nomination, but could give a few hints of his preference along the way.","1830","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The President, in his eulogy, spoke to Beau Biden’s children. “To Natalie and Hunter, there aren’t words big enough to describe how much your dad loved you, how much he loved your mom. But I will tell you what, Michelle and I and Sasha and Malia, we’ve become part of the Biden clan. We’re honorary members now. And the Biden family rule applies. We’re always here for you, we always will be—my word as a Biden.” That might have some resonance for their grandfather, as well. Why not run?","1831","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Until we see the details of the new proposal from Athens, which is due to be delivered to Greece’s European creditors by midnight on Thursday, it is hard to assess the chances of a face-saving deal that would keep the country in the eurozone. The outlines of a possible compromise are already emerging, however. In exchange for Greece promising to introduce more spending cuts and start implementing structural reforms to its economy, the creditors would agree to a new bailout that includes the prospect of debt relief.","July 9, 2015","1832","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-debt-deal-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone"
"Until now, the European Union has insisted that debt relief could only be considered after Greece had implemented a series of reforms, which include cutting pensions, reforming the tax system, and liberalizing the labor market. On Thursday morning, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which is comprised of the heads of states of E.U. member governments, broke with this line, saying, “I hope that today we will receive concrete and realistic proposals of reforms from Athens. If this happens, we will also need a parallel proposal from the creditors. The realistic proposal from Greece will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors.”","1833","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-debt-deal-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone"
"“Debt sustainability” is a code phrase for reducing Greece’s vast debt burden, either by extending the maturity of existing loans and cutting their interest rates or writing down their face value. Tusk, a former Prime Minister of Poland who is regarded as a centrist, is in no position, on his own, to insure that Germany and other hardline European countries agree to this course of action, but there are also indications that France and Italy, the second- and third-biggest countries in the eurozone, are working behind the scenes to bring about a compromise. So is the United States, which has long regarded debt relief as a necessary component of any workable solution to the Greek crisis. On Wednesday, at an event in Washington, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated this explicitly. “Greece’s debt is not sustainable,” he said. “The real question is, can [Greece] make the changes that will satisfy Europe to put in place the kind of debt restructuring that needs to be there?”","1834","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-debt-deal-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone"
"According to reports out of Athens on Thursday, the Greek proposal might go further than expected. The newspaper Kathimerini said that the Greek government will acknowledge that Greece’s economy has slipped into recession, and that the country’s G.D.P. could decline by two or three per cent this year, causing another shortfall in tax revenues. To insure that Greece meets a budget-deficit target acceptable to its creditors, the government will propose a package of tax increases and spending cuts of twelve billion dollars over two years, which is substantially more than it had previously agreed to, Kathimerini reported.","1835","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-debt-deal-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone"
"If these reports are accurate, several questions immediately arise. The first is whether it makes economic sense for Greece, a country where one in four people is out of work, to be cutting spending and raising taxes, or whether it would be better off pursuing a Grexit, despite the risks that such a strategy would entail. The second question is whether the Greek Prime Minister and leader of the Syriza Party, Alexis Tsipras, could sell such a proposal to other members of the Syriza movement, and, if he couldn’t manage it, whether he would break with the left to push it through the Greek parliament. “Tsipras called #Grereferendum for a €8-9bln austerity package, now he is gonna have to implement about €12bln,” Yiannis Mouzakis, a Greek blogger who has been critical of Syriza, tweeted.","1836","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-debt-deal-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone"
"The final question is whether, even if Greece does agree to meet most of the demands of its creditors, Germany and its allies will agree to make debt relief part of the agreement. On this, the public statements out of Berlin are still not encouraging. Speaking during a visit to Bosnia, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, ruled out writing off some of Greece’s debts—a procedure often referred to as a “haircut.” “I have said that a classic haircut is out of the question for me, and that hasn’t changed between yesterday and today,” Merkel said. In Frankfurt, Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s flinty finance minister, reiterated his boss’s message, saying that haircuts were against E.U. rules.","1837","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-debt-deal-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone"
"However, that is not quite the end of it. Schäuble also said that he agreed with the International Monetary Fund that Greece’s debt load is not sustainable, and he added that European leaders would discuss the possibility of “reprofiling” the country’s debt, which was apparently a reference to extending loan maturities and changing repayment schedules. Herein may lie the possibility of a classic E.U. rules fudge.","1838","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-debt-deal-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone"
"Last week’s I.M.F. report on Greek debt sustainability said that, even if Greece implemented all of the policies demanded by its creditors, it would require another bailout of about fifty billion euros to cover its expenditures over the next three years, and would also need long-term debt relief. But, if things went well, the I.M.F. said, it might not be necessary to impose a “classic haircut” of the sort Merkel was ruling out. Instead, the amortization periods on Greece’s loans could be extended to forty years, with a twenty-year grace period before any substantial principal repayments were due. In economic terms, such a package would amount to a haircut being imposed on Greece’s creditors, because the present discounted value of the payments they are due would be reduced. But it might be more politically palatable in northern Europe.","1839","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-debt-deal-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone"
"To be sure, such a package wouldn’t resolve the Greek debt problem. Given the new austerity measures that would be part of the agreement, the Greek economy would almost certainly fail to meet its targets for G.D.P. growth and deficit reduction, and, at some point in the future, the creditors would have to accept that full-on debt relief is the only alternative to default. But that would be for future E.U. summits to deal with. If European leaders, Merkel included, really want a way out of the current impasse, “extend and pretend” may be the only option they can agree on.","1840","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-debt-deal-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone"
"Bernie Sanders is not a doctor, and, unlike President Merkin Muffley’s crazed science adviser, he is not in favor of having the government build a luxurious bombproof underground hotel/brothel to insure that white male American officials will be in a position to repopulate the world after a nuclear holocaust. But Sanders, the junior senator/senior citizen from Vermont, does have an astonishingly good idea: interparty campaign debates during the primary season.","July 14, 2015","1841","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"
"“Chuck, we need a lot more debates in this campaign,” Sanders said a few Sundays ago, addressing the host of “Meet the Press.” “I hope very much that we can begin with the Democratic candidates at least as early as July, and also Republicans in those debates as well.”","1842","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"
"Emphasis mine, but Sanders’s, too. The day after his “Meet the Press” appearance, he upped the idea from offhand suggestion to formal proposal. In a letter to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, he observed that “having debates between Democratic and Republican candidates during the primary process” would “engage large numbers of voters who typically do not pay attention to the process until much later, when the general election begins to come into focus.” This, he said, would “get people to participate at higher levels.”","1843","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"
"Sanders offered another plus: “These inter-party debates,” he wrote, “would put in dramatic focus the shallow and at times ridiculous policies and proposals being advocated by the Republican candidates and by their party’s platform.”","1844","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"
"That’s his opinion, of course, and I may agree with him, but it’s not an argument likely to persuade Republicans. It fell to Rachel Maddow to point out that Democrats aren’t the only ones who think that the other side’s ideas are shallow and ridiculous. So why not, she asked,","1845","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"
"I’m sure you can think of a million reasons this is extremely unlikely to happen. I certainly can. Just for fun, though, let’s imagine that it’s a few months from now. Things have begun to settle down. The five Democrats—Clinton, Sanders, Martin O’Malley, Lincoln Chafee, James Webb—are still in the running. The Republican clown car is still full, but it has become obvious which of its occupants are remotely imaginable nominees and which are not. Put the five top plausible Republicans—Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, for sure, Scott Walker, maybe, plus two or three from the Paul/Kasich/Cruz/Perry/etc. grab bag—on one side of a New Hampshire stage. Put the D-5 on the other. And ring the starting bell.","1846","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"
"My guess is that, for the voting public, the biggest benefit of an interparty debate would be its effect on the participating candidates. The dynamic of such a debate would create some interesting incentives, most of them healthy.","1847","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"
"A typical debate among, say, five Republicans or five Democrats is a five-sided free-for-all, and the game is zero-sum. A debate with five Republicans and five Democrats would have ten players, each with his or her own individual interest, but, in important ways, each player would be on a side—a team, if you like. This might encourage a certain discipline. The members of each side would be reminded that what distinguishes them from one another is less important than what distinguishes them from the members of the other side. Nobody would want to be the one whose jab at a teammate provides an opportunity for real-time gloating by the other side. (“I have to agree with Mr. Chafee about Secretary Clinton’s scandalous speech fees.” “Senator Rubio said it better than I could about Jeb Bush’s mediocre record in Florida.”) Everyone on the stage would have to be conscious of an electorate beyond his or her own party’s base. All would have to demonstrate an ability to handle challenges from those who differ from them in ways that go beyond the details of their own party’s ideological orthodoxy. The narcissism of small differences might give way to a clash of larger visions.","1848","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"
"Of course, no one can really predict what would happen, which would be part of the fun. But the television audience would be huge—a lot bigger, I suspect, than for any of the Republican-only or Democrat-only debates. The sheer novelty would be a magnet for eyeballs. Anyway, when the Yankees play the Red Sox, it’s a lot more riveting than watching one or the other take batting practice. And, of course, the fans can still decide who they think is their team’s M.V.P.","1849","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"
"I know, I know. Ain’t gonna happen. But, given the wide-openness of the Republican field, with no clear favorite, I don’t see why five G.O.P. candidates couldn’t be persuaded to participate. And, while Hillary Clinton, as an undisputed front-runner, doesn’t have a lot to gain from lots and lots of sparring sessions with her four Democratic rivals, a debate with Republicans in the mix might be a different story. It’s hard to imagine her fellow Democrats trashing her under those conditions, especially on so-called “character” issues. For reasons of party loyalty, ideological affinity, civic responsibility, and—let’s be frank—simple gallantry, they might even be inclined to have her back.","1850","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/interparty-debates-yes-please"

"“Times down here ain’t what they used to be when the old stuff was flowing from the still,” a clay-pipe-puffing Vinegar Hill resident told the Times, in 1894. He went on, “The fellows who had luck have all moved up town, where they are living in brownstone houses, wearing diamonds, and driving fast horses.” The “fellows” were those who’d prospered from vast illicit distilling operations, until raids shut them down. Now new hooch flows in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, near former bootlegging battlefields; on summer Fridays and Saturdays, in the pleasant garden of the Kings County Distillery, one can enjoy a mint julep or a John Collins (apologies to Tom—it has bourbon in lieu of gin). The distillery is in a brick building with the warm smell of a country club’s oak locker room. Outside, one recent afternoon, Hank Williams, on the stereo, lamented, “My bucket’s got a hole in it / I can’t buy no beer” as people at picnic tables sampled honey moonshine (flavored with honeycombs from the Brooklyn Grange’s apiaries) and bitter chocolate whiskey (infused with Mast Brothers’ cacao husks). The sun had set on what the Times dubbed the “golden era for the bold and buoyant brigands” with their “mountain dew,” but it still shone upon those playing corn hole and sipping mercifully legal Manhattans.

"As you have doubtless noticed, the terrorist attacks in Paris have produced a rhetorical race to the bottom among the Republican candidates for President. Jeb Bush took an early lead in this descent by issuing a proposal that appeared to have been taken from the playbook of his elder brother George. Appearing on television over the weekend, Bush said that the United States should put together a multinational coalition to invade Syria, mash ISIS to smithereens, and knock off the Assad regime, and only then figure out how to establish peace and withdraw.","November 19, 2015","1877","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"On Monday, Chris Christie, another struggling candidate, argued that the first priority was securing the homefront, which meant that the United States couldn’t risk allowing in any more Syrian refugees—not even young children who had lost their parents. “I don’t think orphans under five are being, you know, should be admitted into the United States at this point,” the New Jersey Governor told Hugh Hewitt, the conservative talk-show host.","1878","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"For heartlessness, illiberalism, and irresponsibility, Christie’s statement seemed hard to beat. But Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, isn’t one to concede defeat easily. Speaking to Sean Hannity, of Fox News, on Tuesday, Trump said that, in order to forestall possible attacks on American soil, the federal government might have to close down mosques. “Nobody wants to say this, and nobody wants to shut down religious institutions,” Trump said. But, he continued, “there’s absolutely no choice. Some really bad things are happening, and they are happening fast.”","1879","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"In an interview with Yahoo News, which was also carried out on Tuesday, Trump expanded on his ideas for preventing another terrorist attack on this side of the Atlantic. “We’re going to have to do things that we never did before.” he said. “And some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule. And certain things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy. And so we’re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago.”","1880","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"The reporter who carried out the interview, Hunter Walker, then pressed Trump about how far he would be willing to go. Walker asked whether the level of surveillance Trump was advocating might require registering Muslims in a database or, in Walker’s words, “giving them a form of special identification that noted their religion.” Trump wouldn’t rule out the idea. “We’re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,” he said. “We’re going to have to look at the mosques. We’re going to have to look very, very carefully.”","1881","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"Like many people in the media, I sometimes still have difficulty taking what Trump says seriously. Yes, I know that he’s leading the polls, and has been for months. I’m also aware that his poll numbers reflect widespread disaffection and alienation among some parts of the American population, especially the white working class, a feeling that he is cleverly exploiting. To that extent, the Trump phenomenon is real.","1882","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"What’s hard to take seriously, or even literally, is what comes out of Trump’s mouth—statements like: the Mexican government is sending us their criminals and murderers. Deport eleven million undocumented immigrants. Cut the tax rate to ten per cent or less for anyone earning under a hundred thousand dollars a year. Megyn Kelly is a lightweight. Ben Carson’s youthful anger problem can be compared to child molestation. Since so much of what Trump says is hot air, it’s tempting to dismiss all of it as mere rabble-rousing or showboating.","1883","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"In this case, however, it’s surely time to call him out—and some people are already doing just that. Picking up on the Yahoo interview, the Raw Story ran an article headlined “Trump Crosses the Nazi Line: Maybe Muslims Should Wear Special ID Badges.” A headline at Jezebel referred to Trump as “A Literal Fascist.” On Twitter, the astronomer and author Phil Plait commented, “There comes a time when decent, thoughtful, responsible people point out that this is, in fact, what Hitler did.”","1884","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"It is important to be careful with language, which Trump often isn’t. Walker’s account at Yahoo makes it clear that he was the one who brought up the possibility of registering American Muslims or making them carry special identification, and that Trump didn’t endorse these proposals. But Trump didn’t dismiss them, either, even after stories appeared attributing the ideas to him. And he did tell Walker that some measures previously considered “unthinkable” were going to be necessary, such as closing down mosques, and that “security is going to rule.”","1885","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"To some extent, Trump may simply be seeking to maintain an edge over his G.O.P. rivals in an atmosphere that is bordering on hysteria. “Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration & the wall,” he tweeted on Thursday. “After Paris, they’re all on the bandwagon.” But there is a difference between playing politics and deliberately targeting an entire religious group.","1886","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"On Thursday night, Trump confirmed that if he were elected President, he would establish a database to track Muslims in the United States. “I would certainly implement that. Absolutely,” he told NBC News after appearing at a town-hall event in Iowa. Trump said that American Muslims would be legally obligated to sign up for the database and added, “It’s all about management. Our country has no management.” He also sought to link the proposed database to the debate about immigration, saying, “It would stop people coming in illegally.”","1887","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"
"That’s more Trump bluster, of course. Forcing every Muslim in the country to register for some sort of database would do nothing to secure the borders or stanch the flow of undocumented migrants. It also wouldn’t prevent the possibility of some radicalized and disaffected American youths deciding to join the jihadi cause. Indeed, by stigmatizing an entire religious community, it would make such behavior more likely. Trump must know that his proposals don’t make sense, but he’s pushing on regardless. He has moved from rabble-rousing to demagoguery, or something even uglier. And this time, sadly, we have no option but to take him seriously.","1888","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims"

"In the past few days, one thing we’ve been reminded of, as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush have sniped at each other about whether George W. Bush “kept us safe,” is that the two men represent two different schoolyard types. Trump is the sort of bully who relies on a freewheeling instinct for the weaknesses of others—in this case, an opponent who is reduced to befuddled outrage whenever he is called on to speak publicly about his brother. Trump’s aim can be scattershot, but he can hurt. Jeb Bush is a more refined bully, who simply expects everyone to share his amazement that a person who doesn’t fit in would dare show up for a party or for a debate—the sort whose go-to insult is “weirdo.” “Does anybody actually blame my brother for the attacks on 9/11? If they do, they’re totally marginalized in our society,” Bush told Jake Tapper, on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Margins are not an area that Bush navigates comfortably. He repeatedly gives the unfortunate impression that he has never really listened to people who do not share his set of beliefs, and that he’s confused about why they are taken seriously. That doesn’t help when there are already concerns that the Presidency is caught in a closed dynastic loop. Indeed, nothing about this fight will reassure those who worry about Bush’s competence as a campaigner. Because another thing that Trump has illustrated is that Jeb Bush is an easy mark, and that he doesn’t even know why.","October 19, 2015","1890","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-the-911-bullies"
"Bush, after all, started it. In the September 16th Republican Presidential debate, he jumbled an answer about who his national-security advisers might be. The people he’d mentioned were mostly associated with his brother’s Administration, or his father’s, and Trump talked about the errors of the war in Iraq, as Rand Paul tried to jump in.","1891","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-the-911-bullies"
"Trump responded, “I don’t know. You feel safe right now? I don’t feel so safe.” But he doesn’t seem to have felt that the way he cut Bush down was adequate to the task. Last week, interviewing Trump for Bloomberg Television, Stephanie Ruhle set him off by asking how, in reassuring the public after a catastrophe, he might emulate George W. Bush’s appearances after September 11th, or Obama’s after Sandy Hook. “I need to know that you will make us feel safe, and make us feel proud,” she said. Trump replied, “I think I have a bigger heart than all of them. I think I’m much more competent than all of them. When you talk about George Bush—I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time.”","1892","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-the-911-bullies"
"“Hold on, you can’t blame George Bush for that,” Ruhle said. Sure, he could. As Trump explained, “He was President, O.K.? Blame him or don’t blame him, but he was President. The World Trade Center came down during his reign.” He didn’t seem to be using the word “reign” ironically. Afterward, Trump suggested that, by waiting a couple of weeks after the debate to make that statement, he had exercised almost heroic restraint. “I just didn’t want to embarrass him,” he said on Saturday, according to the Washington Post. On Sunday, he repeated the charge in an interview with Chris Wallace, on Fox News. And, on Monday, on “Fox and Friends,” Trump said, “If you look at it, Jeb, during the debate, said, ‘My brother kept us safe,’ and I said to myself I didn’t want to embarrass him that night, but I said to myself, well, wait a minute. He kept us safe?”","1893","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-the-911-bullies"
"Because this is Donald Trump, and not a careful historian of the September 11th attacks, he began throwing in ways that he would have stopped Al Qaeda. Some were non sequiturs (stricter immigration controls—although almost all of the terrorists had valid student, tourist, or business visas); others were a bit alarming (on “Fox and Friends”: under a President Trump, “we’d have a massive whistle-blower system,” by which he seems to have meant a mass informant system). But he also alluded to the failure of American intelligence agencies to share intelligence. As Lawrence Wright has written for The New Yorker, in a reproach to those who argue that 9/11 showed the need to remove limits on the N.S.A., the F.B.I. had a warrant in hand that could have helped stop the attack, if it hadn’t been bureaucratically thwarted. “There was no need for a metadata-collection program,” Wright concludes. In The Atlantic, Peter Beinart provides a catalogue of signals and warnings that the Bush Administration failed to act on, partly owing to its focus on Iraq, and points out that, although it’s impossible to know whether heeding those warnings would have stopped the attacks, raising that possibility hardly puts a person in the realm of the “truthers”—as Ari Fleischer, George W. Bush’s press secretary, said of Trump. Jeb Bush responded by saying that even opening the subject is “pathetic.” Anyway, he told Tapper, he was really talking about how “my brother responded to a crisis”: after the attacks, “he united the country, he organized our country, and he kept us safe.”","1894","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-the-911-bullies"
"And that is where Jeb Bush most gets lost. He is setting Trump—and not just Trump—up for the obvious reply: maybe no terrorist group followed up with anything like the September 11th attacks, but George W. Bush launched an invasion of Iraq that crumbled into civil war, destabilized the region, led to the neglect of Afghanistan, and laid the foundation for ISIS. By keeping “us” safe, does Jeb Bush also mean the more than four thousand Americans who died in Iraq, the more than three thousand who died in Afghanistan, and the many thousands more who were wounded? It’s a good guess that “us” does not encompass the Iraqis who died; their estimated number ranges from a hundred thousand to more than half a million. Perhaps by “safe,” Bush only means “complacent.”","1895","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-the-911-bullies"
"Bush’s campaign also released an Internet video that mocks Trump for being unserious. This is not a tough task. And yet the video feels off-key: the music out of step with shots that show Trump making faces—like some weirdo. The paralysis of Bush and the Republican establishment is such that they can hardly articulate the case that Trump is silly, let alone the more important one that he is extreme. And that should be even easier. On “Fox and Friends,” Trump also mulled getting rid of the Environmental Protection Agency: “We’ll be fine with the environment. We can leave a little bit, but you can’t destroy businesses.” Whether he meant “a little bit” of the environment or of regulation wasn’t clear. Against this, Bush has only a barrage of awkwardness. He told Tapper, “Look, the process part of this is not my motivation to run.” The process part still has a way to go, including a debate next week, on CNBC. When Tapper asked Bush about Trump’s successful drive to get CNBC to limit the debate to two hours, he said, “I can do three, I can do two. Whatever they decided, I’m ready to go.” And then he added, “I could do four if forced to, but that would be—that mentally might be too much.” On Monday morning, perhaps trying to change the subject, he tweeted news of a contest to give supporters a chance to meet his family in Houston: “My brother is in. Are you?”","1896","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-the-911-bullies"
"Behind the brash, self-aggrandizing, and occasionally obnoxious exterior that Donald Trump presents to the world lurks a not entirely inconsequential level of intelligence and self-awareness. “I play to people’s fantasies,” he has said in explaining his business success, which is based, to a large extent, on the often blatantly false idea that anything with his name on it is bigger, better, more exclusive, and more glamorous than rival products. “I call it truthful hyperbole.”","September 11, 2015","1897","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"When Trump entered Republican politics, which, increasingly, is the politics of reaction and resentment, he quickly grasped that making outlandish statements served a purpose in that arena, too, especially if his remarks were laced with vinegar. Indeed, he found that the bigger, badder, and meaner the persona he adopted was, the better he did in the polls.","1898","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Doubtless, this was welcome news to him. As anyone who has followed Trump’s career knows, he has always had very thin skin, which naturally inclines him to lash out at critics in the media and elsewhere who dare to question his claims. Now, it seemed, he could give vent to his inner nature and also do himself some good. Thus was born Trump the serial insulter, a political phenom who, for the past six weeks or so, has been sitting dandy atop the G.O.P. primary polls. Indeed, a new CNN poll shows that his level of support among likely Republican voters has crossed the thirty-per-cent mark. Apart from Ben Carson, another political neophyte, who was at nineteen per cent, the rest of the Republican candidates are all stuck in single figures.","1899","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"The CNN poll was released shortly after Rolling Stone reported that Trump had said, in remarks directed at Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and the only woman running in the G.O.P. primary, “Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?”","1900","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Trump’s comments about Mexican immigrants, John McCain, and Megyn Kelly, among others, have accustomed us to his outrageous and misogynistic statements. (He has twice retweeted someone who called Kelly, the star of Fox’s news division, a “bimbo.”) In the political world, indeed, there has been growing acceptance that Trump can get away with saying things that other candidates can’t; in some quarters, there was even reluctant admiration for how adeptly he was exploiting this advantage.","1901","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Until now, that is.","1902","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"On Thursday, with very good reason, he was subjected to criticism from virtually every quarter, including from some Republican rivals who, earlier in the summer, had tried to ignore him. Jeb Bush called Trump’s remarks about Fiorina “small and inappropriate,” and said that he seemed intent on insulting his way to the Presidency. Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, called Trump an “egomaniacal madman who has no principles,” and said that it was time for him to return to reality television. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton said that Trump “seems to delight in insulting women every chance he gets.” Fiorina refused to respond directly, stating merely that, with her recent (if modest) rise in the polls, she seemed to be getting under Trump’s skin.","1903","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Trump, for once, seemed to be knocked off balance by all this. Initially, in an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, he had suggested that Jann Wenner, the liberal publisher of Rolling Stone, had altered the article to make him look bad. “The writer actually called me and said, ‘I’m so upset, I wrote this great story and Jann Wenner screwed it up . . . because they added a lot of stuff, a lot of garish stuff, that I think is disgusting,’ ” Trump claimed.","1904","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Perhaps realizing that this story might not go over well, he provided an alternative explanation to Fox News, arguing that he had been talking about Fiorina’s “persona” rather than her physical appearance. “I say that about a lot of people,” he said. “I say, Look at that . . . . That’s not going to be our President!” Unfortunately for Trump, a quick glance at the article confirms that his remarks were surely directed at Fiorina’s appearance. The writer, Paul Solotaroff, was hanging out with Trump and some of his staffers on his private plane. They were watching the news and joshing around. This is Solotaroff’s description of the scene:","1905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Later on Thursday, Trump tried out yet another line. Appearing once again on Fox News, he was confronted by a skeptical Greta Van Susteren, who said to him, “I don’t think you’re a first-time offender making a personal crack at a woman . . . the remark was about her face, and not about her persona.” This time, Trump suggested that he had been speaking not as a Presidential candidate but as an entertainer. “I did ‘The Apprentice’ and it was one of the top shows on television,” Trump said, adding, “Some comments are made as an entertainer and, as everybody said, as an entertainer is a much different ballgame.”","1906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"That it is, and the issue now is whether Trump will finally suffer some adverse consequences for breaking the rules of his adopted sport. One theory, expostulated in this week’s edition of The Economist, suggests that he won’t. “He says things that no politician would, so people think he is not a politician,” an article in the magazine said. “His supporters . . . think his boorishness is a sign of authenticity—of a leader who can channel the rage of those who feel betrayed by the elite or left behind by social change.”","1907","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Surely, there is something in this argument. Even angry Republicans, however, demand a certain level of civility in their Presidential candidates. Or, at least, Trump’s frantic efforts to divert attention from what he actually said about Fiorina suggest that they do. So does the rise in the polls of Ben Carson, who is civil to a fault. Trump, by contrast, just can’t seem to quit. Like a gambler on a lucky streak, he keeps doubling down. Unlike normal gamblers, however, he has appeared during his campaign to be playing with the odds loaded in his favor.","1908","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"
"Maybe, just maybe, that is changing. When Trump made his remarks about Megyn Kelly having “blood coming out of her whatever,” there was at least some ambiguity about what he really meant. This time, there is none. Still, Trump won’t apologize. “What can I say, I’m leading with the evangelicals, I’m leading with women,” he said to Van Susteren. “I’m leading with African-Americans, with a very high number, and I’m leading with Hispanics, which is very interesting and I’m not surprised, because I’m gonna bring jobs back to our country.”","1909","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer"

But Mamet’s book also offers some shrewd observations on politics and serves as a useful tool for understanding the rise, and potential fall, of Donald Trump.","September 18, 2015","1942","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"On Wednesday evening, during the Republican Presidential debate on CNN, Trump was exposed as ignorant of basic policy details (he was a bystander during the foreign-policy exchanges), boorish (he refused to apologize to Columba Bush for saying that her background influenced Jeb’s allegedly permissive views on undocumented immigrants), and he seemed—no other way to put it—“low energy” as the debate dragged on into its third hour. (As my colleague Amy Davidson put it, “he seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake.”) Political observers then spent the day after the debate ruminating on whether we may be witnessing the beginning of Trump’s decline, and whether his fate will look similar to that of the five Republican candidates—Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum—who all experienced similar polling surges in the 2012 G.O.P. Presidential contest, before Republican voters wised up and picked Mitt Romney.","1943","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Why did Trump’s support shoot up to an average of almost thirty-five per cent in national polls? The (boring) political-science answer is that Trump’s support was a function of his news coverage. His rise correlates perfectly with the amount of attention he received from the media. When voters, most of whom don’t pay close attention to politics, are asked to choose from a long list of names, a third mention the one that they’ve heard in the news most recently or most frequently.","1944","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"But that explanation seems to leave a lot out. Why does the media cover Trump so much? Are voters, especially “the likely voters” who are often polled, really that passive and ignorant? Why did they express increasingly positive views of him, as measured by favorability ratings, as the summer of Trump rolled on? How did Trump seize our attention?","1945","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"He did it by stepping onto the summer stage in a way that none of his rivals did. The other Republican candidates spent 2015 attending to the traditional business of the so-called invisible primary: hiring staff, studying up on policy, building political networks in Iowa and New Hampshire, wooing elected officials whose endorsements might make a difference, and—most of all—courting donors.","1946","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Most of the invisible primary is, well, invisible. Getting inside the rooms in New York and Miami and Dallas and Washington where the transactions of the invisible primary take place is nearly impossible. Sometimes good stories drip out, but they make for terrible TV. Meanwhile, much of the public portion of the invisible primary bores the media. Generally, the policy speeches and town-hall events in the early stages of the campaign are vague and uninteresting, as candidates resist taking firm and detailed positions on controversial topics for fear of opening themselves up to attacks later on.","1947","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"But the political press demands drama. If it is not given a plot, it will create one. As Mamet argues, this is hardly unique to reporters. Humans are hardwired to turn mundane experiences into dramatic ones. “It is in our nature to dramatize,” he writes. “We dramatize the weather, the traffic, and other impersonal phenomena by employing exaggeration, ironic juxtaposition, inversion, projection, all the tools the dramatist uses to create, and the psychoanalyst uses to interpret, emotionally significant phenomena.”","1948","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"A political campaign that is organized around a drama has an immediate advantage over one that is not. Mamet argues, and he’s right, that politics “sticks closer to traditional drama than does The Stage itself. A problem is stated, the play begins, the hero (candidate) offers herself as the protagonist who will find the solution, and the audience gives its attention.”","1949","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Which of the candidates has done that this year? Trump—and, to some extent, Bernie Sanders—has provided a plot and fared well. Trump has identified a clear problem to which many Republican voters respond: America doesn’t “win anymore.” And he has offered a simple solution that only he can provide: Trump “will make America great again.”","1950","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"The fact that the problem and solution are laughably vague is a virtue. Hillary Clinton’s campaign has been forgettable exactly because she has insisted on promoting a myriad of highly specific solutions to very concrete problems before she has laid out the one big problem she wants to solve. (In fact, it’s not so different from how Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign of “hope and change” crushed Clinton’s campaign of policy white papers.) Mamet argues that a politician “who promises drama and then delivers only social concern” rarely excites the public. That’s why it’s “essential to the healthy political campaign that the issues be largely or perhaps totally symbolic—i.e. non-quantifiable.” He recites a long list of slogans from recent American history, to which Trump’s could easily be added: “Peace with Honor, Communists in the State Department, Supply Side Economics, Recapture the Dream, Bring Back the Pride.” The less detail, he argues, the more engaged the audience will be: “A loose abstraction allows audience members to project their own desires onto an essentially featureless goal.”","1951","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Trump realized all of this, and he has had a great first act. But Wednesday night’s debate suggested that he has no plan for a second act. First acts are famously easy to pull off. “It has often been remarked that anyone can write a good first act,” Mamet notes. “When the curtain goes up, we’ve got your attention. So we dramatists don’t have to do anything for a while. Later, either the plot will kick in or the audience will start yawning and eating popcorn.”","1952","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"The struggle of the second act in a political campaign, as in any drama, is that the problem identified at the beginning—the one that seized our attention—must be translated into the more mundane tasks that propel the protagonist toward his or her goal. Won’t even the most committed Trump supporter start to wonder why this self-proclaimed savior hasn’t prepared himself to answer standard policy questions? Will Trump build a staff and campaign infrastructure in Iowa and New Hampshire to handle all the dull mechanics of finding voters and getting them to the polls? Again, Obama’s historic 2008 campaign is a good point of comparison: the vague promise of “hope and change” was married to an enormously sophisticated national operation that tended to the mechanics of winning the delegates needed to capture his party’s nomination.","1953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Mamet illustrates second-act problems—and their solutions—by pointing to the real-life examples of political actors who actually changed history. The most ambitious and inspirational leaders are also the ones who, after articulating what seemed to be an impossibly lofty goal, soon found themselves mired in the tedious work required to realize it. “In the middle term the high-minded goal has devolved into what seem to be quotidian, mechanical, and ordinary drudgery,” Mamet writes. Trump seems more ill-prepared to bother with the ordinary drudgery of politics than anyone in the race.","1954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Perhaps Trump can keep the first act going a little longer, but it is far more likely—and the debate made it seem obvious—that he hasn’t a clue how to move beyond the bluster and bromides that initially seized our attention. The curtain may come down soon.","1955","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"This is getting interesting. On Tuesday, the day before the second televised G.O.P. debate, a new poll, carried out for the New York Times and CBS News, showed Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, gaining strongly on Donald Trump among Republican voters. This is the latest in a series of surveys that has shown Carson moving up, but the previous surveys still had Trump ahead by double digits. In this one, Trump’s lead was down to just four points, which isn’t even statistically significant. Twenty-seven per cent of likely G.O.P. voters said that they would support Trump, and twenty-three per cent said that they would support Carson.","September 15, 2015","1956","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Yes, it is just one poll, and the usual caveats about sampling error and outliers apply. But this was the first national survey carried out since Trump made his offensive remarks about Carly Fiorina’s appearance, and it suggests that they may have damaged him and helped Carson.

"The poll raises the stakes for tomorrow night’s Republican debate, which will be shown on CNN. Assuming that Carson emerges from the debate without making any big mistakes, he could well enjoy another lift, which would raise an intriguing possibility: Will establishment Republicans, in the interests of defeating Trump, whom they regard as a dangerous interloper, start to rally behind Carson—another political neophyte, but one who seems less eager to challenge traditional G.O.P. nostrums than Trump is?","1958","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"At this stage, anyway, the polling data suggests that Carson is the only electorally viable alternative to Trump in the G.O.P. primary. In the new survey, as in a number of previous ones, all of the candidates except Trump and Carson scored in the single figures. Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, and Marco Rubio each got six per cent. Ted Cruz got five per cent. Fiorina got four per cent. The rest of the pack got three per cent or less.","1959","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Backers of more orthodox Republican politicians will no doubt be hoping that these candidates do well in Wednesday’s debate and subsequently pick themselves up off the floor. But how long can the party hierarchy and its financial backers afford to wait? With Trump parading around the country, saying C.E.O. pay levels are disgraceful and promising to abolish some tax breaks enjoyed by the rich, some of his fellow plutocrats are already eager to take him down. On Tuesday, the Club for Growth, a right-wing pressure group that has received funding from a number of conservative billionaires, announced that it was launching an anti-Trump advertising campaign in Iowa and other states. “We’ll continue doing it until people realize that Donald Trump is not an economic conservative,” the organization’s president, David M. McIntosh, said at a press conference in Washington.","1960","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"As the old saying goes, though, you can’t beat something with nothing, and, right now, Carson looks like he might be the something that worried Republicans need. A world-renowned surgeon who was brought up in Detroit by his mother, after his parents divorced, Carson has an inspirational life story to relate. A supporter of a balanced-budget amendment, a skeptic about most government programs, and a harsh critic of Obamacare (last year, he said it has done more damage to the United States than the 9/11 attacks), he is singing a tune that conservatives want to hear. On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, he may well have the calmness and self-confidence to stand up to Trump’s jibes without being rattled. Last week, after Trump questioned Carson’s energy level and called him just an “O.K. doctor” —a laughably inaccurate description—Carson responded gracefully.","1961","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"For Carson, a lot depends on Wednesday night’s debate. CNN has been promoting the event as “Round two of a heavyweight bout,” and much of the attention will be focussed on how Trump and Fiorina interact, following Trump’s offensive remarks about Fiorina’s appearance. But Carson, who was largely overlooked at last month’s Fox News debate, will also be a big part of the story. If he holds his own, or does better than that, it would confirm his position as the main rival to Trump.","1962","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"Until now, the Republican establishment, for want of a better strategy, has been largely waiting for the Trump phenomenon to blow over. Recently, some of the candidates, Jeb Bush included, have started to criticize Trump, but that hasn’t done them much good, either. In a year when much of the Republican electorate appears to have soured on all politicians, only Carson has made much of a dent on Trump’s lead. If you were a mega-rich Republican, or a Karl Rove type, why wouldn’t you take that as a cue to throw some serious money and organizational might in the direction of Carson’s campaign, which, until now, has largely relied on small donations? If nothing else, it could serve as an insurance policy.","1963","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/could-the-g-o-p-unite-behind-ben-carson-to-defeat-donald-trump"
"It has been widely reported that many Republican bigwigs and strategists have serious doubts about Carson’s political skills, and his ability to withstand all of the attention and craziness that comes with being a serious contender. That’s understandable. He’s a doctor, not a politician, and he has made some gaffes in the past, such as suggesting that the prevalence of homosexuality in prisons shows that being gay is a choice.

"Most of the Republican super-donors and super PACs have to date directed their favors elsewhere. However, on Sunday, the Times reported that Carson was starting to attract some larger donations. He has also added a number of fund-raisers to his schedule. That could be just the beginning.

"Though he didn’t use the term, Trump was referring to Operation Wetback, in 1954, which, as William Finnegan recently wrote for The New Yorker, “was no more humane than its name.” It was notable for the harsh treatment of Mexican-Americans; at least five deportees died when they jumped, in desperation, from overcrowded ships. And yet, as Finnegan writes, “The government’s claims to have deported a million undocumented Mexican immigrants have been debunked by historians. A real reduction in the numbers of the undocumented was accomplished, according to Kelly Lytle Hernández, a history professor at U.C.L.A., by ‘the operation’s parallel but lesser-known campaign to legalize authorized farm workers.’ ”","1969","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-donald-trump-met-edmund-burke"

"The Trump view on this issue is widely shared among a large swath of Americans, and needs to be answered seriously. Those eleven or twelve million non-citizens, he points out, are in the United States illegally.

"But from that simple conservative premise—that the law is paramount—comes the most radical policy offered by any Presidential candidate in either party this year: the involuntary removal of some three per cent of the American population.

"Other conservatives look at the immigration issue and concede that, yes, these immigrants broke the law, but that there are many other circumstances to consider in developing a policy remedy. For example, many of these immigrants fill jobs that Americans don’t want, making them a cornerstone of our economy; it’s too expensive and too cruel to uproot and deport them; empowering immigration agents to round up eleven million people would create profound civil liberty issues; and so on.","1974","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-donald-trump-met-edmund-burke"
"Which of these responses is “conservative”? The father of modern conservatism is Edmund Burke, the eighteenth-century British political philosopher who was deeply suspicious of radicals of any stripe. Burke generally viewed prudence and stability as the guiding lights of conservatism. “A statesman, never losing sight of principles, is to be guided by circumstances,” he wrote, in an oft-quoted passage, “and judging contrary to the exigencies of the moment he may ruin his country for ever.”","1975","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-donald-trump-met-edmund-burke"

"When the debate turned to foreign policy, some of the candidates flipped sides. On what to do in the complex wars engulfing the Middle East, Trump and Paul advised caution, while Bush insisted American intervention could solve the region’s myriad problems.

"“You’re asking for a no-fly zone in an area in which Russia already flies,” Paul said. “Russia flies in that zone at the invitation of Iraq. I’m not saying it’s a good thing, but you’d better know at least what we’re getting into. So, when you think it’s going to be a good idea to have a no-fly zone over Iraq, realize that means you are saying we are going to shoot down Russian planes. If you’re ready for that, be ready to send your sons and daughters to another war in Iraq.” Paul essentially argued that Bush’s no-fly zone was about as practical as Trump’s immigration plan— “naïve to the point of being something you might hear in junior high.”","1978","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-donald-trump-met-edmund-burke"

"The Burkeans have been losing ground in the Republican Party for a while now. Too often their old conception of conservatism strikes others in the G.O.P. as a form of surrender or, at the very least, an acceptance of the liberal status quo. When a successful Democrat has been in power for two terms, the Burkeans can appear too ready to accept the other party’s legislative victories. It is the political equivalent of stare decisis, the principle by which judges generally respect precedents, or things already decided, to maintain stability and social order.","1980","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-donald-trump-met-edmund-burke"
"Two of the big stories of the Republican primaries so far are how the Party’s grass roots have rejected Kasich and Bush’s Burkean approach to immigration and how the Party’s foreign-policy establishment has rejected Trump and Paul’s Burkean approach to the Middle East. The two candidates on the rise, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, seem to have a better chance at navigating this terrain. Last night, neither of them endorsed Trump’s plan, but they also declined to attack Trump the same way that Kasich and Bush did. Cruz was clearly more sympathetic to Trump’s views on immigration, but Rubio, who once worked for comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate, has also begun to adopt Trumpian language (though not the full deportation policy).","1981","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-donald-trump-met-edmund-burke"
"On foreign policy, Rubio is in the revolutionary camp, often arguing, along with Bush, that America can and should enthusiastically intervene around the world to shape outcomes in our favor, though he is also careful to downplay the cost of such proposals in terms of troops sent aboard or dollars spent.

"Evidently, the folks at CNN decided that an hour was about as long as they could keep people hanging. That was the point in the debate, which was held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, in Simi Valley, California, when the host, Jake Tapper, asked Carly Fiorina to comment on Donald Trump’s recent offensive remarks about her appearance. (According to Rolling Stone, Trump said, after seeing Fiorina on television, “Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next President?”)","1985","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Until that point, the debate had gone pretty much as expected, with various candidates taking their shots at knocking Trump off his perch, and the seemingly indestructible New York businessman bluffing his way through without suffering much apparent injury. Tapper raised Rand Paul’s concern, expressed on CNN earlier in the week, about a man of Trump’s temperament having his finger on the nuclear button. (Trump replied, “My temperament is very good, very calm.”) Jeb Bush had accused Trump of using political donations to lobby for Florida to legalize casino gambling, and claimed that he had rebuffed Trump’s attempt. (“Jeb, don’t make things up. Come on,” Trump said, rebutting the notion that he’d wanted casino gambling there.) And Scott Walker, evidently unaware of Trump’s actual role on his long-running reality-TV show, said that we don’t need another apprentice in the White House. (Trump didn’t bother responding to that.)","1986","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Fiorina, though, bided her time. Offered an early opportunity to comment on Trump’s putative role as commander of America’s nuclear arsenal, she demurred, noting merely that he was “a wonderful entertainer.” The question of his fitness to be Commander-in-Chief would be one for the voters to answer, she said. A bit later, she made it clear that she had no doubt of her own C-in-C chops. Rather than negotiating with Vladimir Putin (as Trump has suggested he would), Fiorina said that she would rebuild the Sixth Fleet, reconstruct the American missile-defense system in Eastern Europe, and send thousands more troops to Germany. Russia was “a bad actor,” she averred, and Putin was “someone we should not talk to.”","1987","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"That comment earned Fiorina some applause from an audience that appeared to have been drawn from the Hoover Institution/Cold War wing of conservatism, more than the Tea Party. But she didn’t receive nearly as much applause for that as for the response she gave to Tapper’s question about the Rolling Stone article, following another exchange between Trump and Bush, during which Trump emphasized that he’d heard something Bush had said. Looking levelly into the camera, Fiorina, the only female in the G.O.P. race, said calmly but forcefully, “Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly and what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.”","1988","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Doubtless, it was a line that Fiorina had rehearsed, but she delivered it beautifully, and it generated by far the biggest cheers of the night. Trump, for once, seemed somewhat at a loss for words, and his face, which was red all night—it was very hot onstage, and many other candidates were sweating, too—seemed to blush a little deeper. “I think she’s got a beautiful face,” he said, finally, “and I think she’s a beautiful woman.” It wasn’t an apology (Trump doesn’t do those), and it was greeted with near silence.","1989","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"A bit later on, Tapper afforded Trump the opportunity to win back some points of his own, bringing up Fiorina’s record as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. “The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster,” Trump said, citing a study by a Yale professor that described Fiorina’s tenure at H.P. as one of the worst in corporate history. Fiorina stayed calm, though, and showed that she possesses political talents that appeared sadly lacking in her previous venture into electoral politics, an abortive 2010 run in California for the U.S. Senate. In particular, she demonstrated the invaluable ability to deliver whoppers with apparent sincerity. Dismissing the Yale study as the work of a Clintonite, she described her troubled time at H.P., which ended when the company’s board fired her, as a period of revenue growth, innovation, and desperate measures taken in desperate times. She even managed to slip in the fact that, on the day she was fired, Steve Jobs called her to commiserate. All Trump could manage was “I only say this. She can’t run any of my companies.”","1990","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"After that, Trump seemed a bit deflated. (Admittedly, it could have been the heat.) And Fiorina, evidently seeking to portray herself as just as hawkish as any of the men surrounding her, laid it on a bit thick during a discussion of ISIS, saying that she would make sure that the U.S. military had fifty Army brigades, thirty-six Marine battalions, more than three hundred naval ships, and enough nuclear weapons to blow up the entire solar system. (I made up the last bit, but you get the idea: Jeane Kirkpatrick meets Dr. Strangelove.) By that stage, though, it probably didn’t matter. The television audience had dwindled, and the online pundits were already declaring Fiorina the winner—which, until the post-debate polls arrive, means she was the winner.","1991","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"For many of the other candidates, it was a mixed night. Jeb Bush was more forceful than in the previous G.O.P. debate, but the most memorable things he said were that he smoked pot in college, would choose Margaret Thatcher if he had to select a woman to appear on the ten-dollar bill, and would make his Secret Service name Eveready, because, as he explained to Trump, who has accused him of listlessness, “It’s very high energy.” (This comment came in garbage time, and it earned him an ironic low five from the front-runner.) Ben Carson, who is the closest candidate in the polls to Trump, once again disappeared for long stretches, but in a debate that most voters, even Republican voters, will only watch via soundbites, this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for him. He had a couple of strong moments, such as when he revealed that he had advised George W. Bush not to invade Iraq (earning him a high five from Trump, who also opposed the war), and when he affirmed, twice, that there is no evidence that vaccinations cause autism. (Carson even had the temerity, in front of a Republican audience, to suggest that there are moments when it makes more sense to rely on intellect than military force.)","1992","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Marco Rubio, once again, had some good moments, although probably not enough to dislodge him from the position of everybody’s second-favorite candidate. John Kasich, to his credit and, almost certainly, his own detriment, followed a rote assertion that the Iranian nuclear deal was a “bad agreement” with an attempt to defend the virtues of a multilateral approach to foreign policy. Chris Christie, the forgotten man of Trenton, sought to position himself as the adult in the room, admonishing Trump and Fiorina to stop quibbling about their business records and concentrate on the concerns of construction workers who don’t give a fig about their careers. (It must be noted, however, that Christie’s efforts to look serious weren’t helped when he said that his Secret Service security name would be True Heart. Evidently, he was unaware that True Heart is one of the Care Bears.)","1993","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility"
"Those were sidebars, though. The big story was Fiorina’s attempted takedown of Trump. “I think she’s a very nice person,” Trump said in an interview after the debate.

He also promised to slash the corporate tax rate from thirty-five per cent to fifteen per cent, cut the capital-gains tax from twenty-eight per cent to twenty per cent, and abolish the estate tax.

"In short, Christmas came early to Trump Tower. That’s where Trump unveiled his plan, which he called “Tax Reform That Will Make America Great Again.” Apparently seeking to downplay the regressive aspects of the plan, he presented it as an effort to simplify the tax code and help ordinary Americans. “These lower rates will provide a tremendous stimulus for the economy—significant G.D.P. growth, a huge number of new jobs, and an increase in after-tax wages for workers,” he said in a statement.","1996","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-tax-plan-is-a-predictable-cop-out"

In fact, he or she appears to have taken Jeb Bush’s plan, which is itself a testament to voodoo economics, and simply changed some numbers here and there. Bush would cut the top rate to twenty-eight per cent; Trump would go three percentage points lower. Bush would reduce the corporate tax rate to twenty per cent; Trump would cut it to fifteen per cent.

"As Jordan Weissman pointed out at Slate, Trump’s plan is simply an “extra-luxurious” version of Bush’s. It’s also extra-fantastical, extra-regressive, and extra-irresponsible. Trump claimed, for instance, that his tax cuts would be revenue neutral, because he would also abolish some loopholes exploited by the rich. But that claim defies arithmetic. According to a preliminary analysis released on Tuesday by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, the Trump plan would actually reduce over-all tax revenues by ten trillion dollars—yes, trillion—over the coming decade.","1999","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-tax-plan-is-a-predictable-cop-out"
"All of which amounts to a sad, if predictable, cop-out on Trump’s part. For months now, he has been going around the country promising to raise taxes on hedge-fund managers and other beneficiaries of the notorious carried-interest deduction in the tax code. “These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky,” Trump said on “Face the Nation” in August. “The hedge-fund guys are getting away with murder. They’re making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes.” In September, again on “Face the Nation,” he extended his criticisms to C.E.O.s generally, saying that their high salaries were “disgraceful” and “a total and complete joke.” His populist rhetoric even won him plaudits on the left. Earlier this month, Senator Elizabeth Warren said, “Donald Trump and I both agree that there ought to be more taxation of the billionaires, the people who are making their money on Wall Street.” Paul Krugman wrote a column in the Times that was headlined “Trump Is Right on Economics.”","2000","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-tax-plan-is-a-predictable-cop-out"
"It turns out that Trump was either bluffing or being cynical. It’s true that, in abolishing the carried-interest deduction for hedge-fund managers, he would force them to pay a tax rate of twenty-five per cent instead of twenty per cent on some of their income. But, by reducing the top rate on ordinary income from 39.6 per cent to twenty-five per cent, he would give the hedgies and other members of the one per cent a huge break on the taxes they pay on income not covered by the deduction. In addition, he would introduce a new tax break—a rate of just fifteen per cent on “pass-through” income generated by small businesses—that hedge funds and other partnerships might well be able to exploit to their advantage. In the words tweeted out by Len Burman, the respected director of the centrist Tax Policy Center, “#Trump tax plan is huge tax cut on the rich. How huge is hard to say because details are scarce.”","2001","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-tax-plan-is-a-predictable-cop-out"
"Trump’s claims about the benefits of his plan for low-paid workers, some of whom would no longer have to pay any federal income taxes (they would still have to make contributions to Social Security and Medicare), were also accurate, in a sense. But the discrepancies between their projected savings and those of high earners are huge. According to an analysis by the liberal group Citizens for Tax Justice, households in the bottom twenty per cent of the income distribution would save about two hundred and fifty dollars a year. Households in the top one per cent would save, on average, nearly a hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars. So much for Donald Trump as the tribune of the masses.","2002","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-tax-plan-is-a-predictable-cop-out"

Such a figure, if he had channeled worries about immigration, ISIS, and national decline, then combined these with some seriously populist proposals designed to exploit resentment of corrupt financial and political élites, could perhaps have emerged as a genuinely potent and dangerous force. But Trump isn’t that guy. A self-satisfied showman and self-promoter rather than a real insurrectionary, he ultimately hasn’t got much to offer.

That stench, of course, originated with the comments of Donald Trump, who has notoriously denigrated Mexican immigrants in the United States as criminals and rapists.

Opening with a shot of the Stars and Stripes and the screeching chords of Jimi Hendrix’s national anthem, the screen then filled with Trump against a backdrop of U.S. flags in the middle of his most infamous anti-Mexican screed, the one where he says, “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you.” (This is the speech in which he goes on to say, “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.”) Cut to two of those not “best”: the rough and rude and iconic Mexican star, Cuauhtémoc Blanco, who, late in his glorious career, played for the Chicago Fire, leaning forward at a press conference with clenched fist to make a defiantly provocative gesture; and Giovani Dos Santos, a gifted and perpetually underachieving young player with a party-boy reputation, at his recent signing, with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Trump returns, lamenting “Our country is in serious trouble,” followed by a volley of images of Mexicans scoring goals and American players in various postures of defeat and confusion, fans in the stands, draped in Stars-and-Stripes regalia, looking dumbfounded and dour, and back to Trump again as he bemoans, “We don’t have victories anymore”—as if it was the U.S.A. that had gone seven straight matches against their archrivals without winning —and images of Mexican national team glory, euphoric goal celebrations by Dos Santos and others, players hoisting a trophy and jumping up and down in a thick rain of confetti and adoring cheers. “The American dream is dead,” Trump intones in his Charles Bronson-channeling tough-guy voice; the commercial ends with that voice echoing in deep zombie reverb, “It’s dead.”","2024","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-makes-mexican-soccer-great-again"
"Soon thereafter, Fox Sports answered with a rather labored Trump commercial of its own: the leading Republican presidential candidate bombastically shouting, “Bigger, better, stronger,” and “We will make American great,” with imagery that is a like a mirror image of the TV Azteca ad’s throughout, though it does include a bizarre image of U.S. fullback DaMarcus Beasley appearing to drop a Mexican player with a dirty kick to the ankle; or maybe it’s a perfectly executed Mexican flop.","2025","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-makes-mexican-soccer-great-again"
"In the days leading up to the match, the U.S. sports media reported on the high stakes of the match. The U.S. coach, Juergen Klinsmann, told the L.A. Times, “This will be a game that, for the next two or three years to come, is probably the biggest game because it decides who goes to Russia in 2017 [for the Confederations Cup] and it gives you a CONCACAF title. So it’s difficult to beat the importance of that one.” The Confederations Cup is an eight-team tournament played in the same country as the one hosting the World Cup a year later. The former U.S. star and Mexican bête noir, Landon Donavan, declared that Klinsmann’s job, following a recent series of disappointing performances by the U.S. team, should be on the line in the match against Mexico. The U.S. team captain, Michael Bradley, spoke more emotionally when he said, “Games against Mexico are just different. There’s no other way to put it. The passion. The colors. The respect. The hate.” The reliably thoughtful Javier “Chicharito” Hernández, currently the most internationally recognized Mexican player, despite what has so far been an up-and-down career with some of the European leagues’ most élite teams, came closest to acknowledging the game’s fraught subtext when he reflected in the New York Times, “For the most part, I think, the Mexicans in America have had hard lives, [and] have pushed so hard to reach America that when they have a chance to celebrate the Mexican national team, it is like for a day, they are back in their country.”","2026","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-makes-mexican-soccer-great-again"
"“Mexican soccer has lots of problems, and one of those is that we don’t associate our faith in the sport or in our team with results,” Mexico’s most brilliant philosopher of fut, the celebrated novelist and writer Juan Villoro, has observed. “What’s important to the Mexican fan is the opportunity that fútbol provides for a great party.” The match was played in the Rose Bowl, in Pasadena, California, and in the hours before, the parking lots outside filled with already celebrating and predictably optimistic Mexican fans, with their sombreros and flags and ubiquitous Donald Trump piñatas. After smashing the piñata torsos to bits, tailgaters carried the disembodied heads into the stadium.","2027","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-makes-mexican-soccer-great-again"
"The Mexican national team has just hired its seventeenth coach in fifteen years. The good feelings created by the team’s stirring and energetic performance at the 2014 World Cup—falling just short of the coveted and elusive fifth game in a late collapse against the Netherlands, exacerbated by a controversial last-minute penalty against Mexico—had evaporated as its histrionic coach, Miguel “Piojo” (The Louse) Herrera, led the team back into dysfunction. There was a summer of dismal tournament play made worse because Herrera actually managed to make the team seem like yet another expression of Mexican corruption and of its currently reviled PRI government, lowlighted by outlandishly unfair refereeing that propelled the team forward into the Gold Cup finals. Worse, there was the news that Herrera and some players had allegedly participated in the violation of Mexican electoral laws by taking money to send out election-day tweets on behalf of a PRI satellite party. (Herrera denies the allegations.) Herrera’s final implosion came when he punched a Mexican reporter at the Philadelphia airport following his team’s tainted Gold Cup championship, which finally cost him his job.","2028","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-makes-mexican-soccer-great-again"
"Yet under the veteran leadership of the Mexico’s interim coach, Ricardo Ferretti–who had insisted he didn’t want the job permanently–Mexican fútbol had recently seemed to be on the upswing again. The team is chock-full of talented young players who for years have been winning trophies for Mexico in international youth tournaments; at the 2012 London Olympics, a team drawn mostly from Mexico’s twenty-three-and-under squad won the gold medal. On the same Saturday of the Rose Bowl match, Mexico’s twenty-one-and-under team had qualified for the 2016 Rio Olympics by defeating Canada. Meanwhile, several of the promising young Mexicans playing in Europe were now starting and flourishing for their teams.","2029","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-makes-mexican-soccer-great-again"
"Saturday night’s Rose Bowl match, of course, turned out to be epic and gruelling. Mexico scored first, in the tenth minute, when a scintillating sequence of passes set up Chicharito for an easy goal on the right side. But the U.S. soon answered with a forceful Geoff Cameron header off a free kick. A majority of the crowd was obviously pro-Mexican, but large contingents of U.S. fans were visible and effusive. Observing those festively red-, white- and blue-clad fans, it felt warped to want to associate them with Trump. Indeed, probably the least likely of U.S. sports fans to be Trump supporters are those who follow soccer. Blessedly, as the match ground on through the rest of the first half and for the length of the second half without producing another goal, political passions and fears seemed to drop away, as if out of exhaustion. There was just the pitch, and the relentless match itself, incredibly tense but also exasperating, as each team displayed strengths but also the weaknesses that have kept them confined to the second tier of world soccer powers, and, year after year, driven their fans crazy. Mexico controlled possession of the ball, mounting wave after wave of promising attacks, but seemed unable to score. Its attackers lacked decisiveness, or a killer instinct, at the crucial moments–Chicharito, in an all too typical performance, flubbed two clear chances to score. The U.S. players seemed to give up on trying to run with their swifter Mexican opponents, packing their own goal zone with defenders as if playing for a tie, though more likely lying in wait for a chance to launch swift counterattacks. When the match moved into overtime, Mexico finally scored again, and its fans, sensing victory, were euphoric. But the Mexican side displayed another of its characteristic flaws, unable to hold a late lead as if it, too, had already begun to celebrate. After the U.S. grittily tied the score at 2—2, the match seemed headed to a dismal resolution by penalty kicks. At the hundred-and-eighteenth minute, Raul Jiménez toed a high lob backward over his own head which descended into the path of a streaking Paul Aguilar, who—with sublime decisiveness and killer instinct—fired a low streak into the net. It was “a goal,” Villoro e-mailed me, “that Paul Aguilar won’t be able to repeat in his life.” Pandemonium.","2030","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-makes-mexican-soccer-great-again"
"“The ‘Trump’ climate was very present,” Villoro added. “You could feel it in the happiness of the crowd that stayed for two hours singing ‘Cielito Lindo.’ ” Propelled by those voices singing proudly and jubilantly in the stadium, and by the vocal celebrations and relieved sighs of millions throughout Mexico and the U.S., a certain noxious cloud and its stench was propelled, at least for the rest of this night, far out into the Pacific. It will surely be back, but probably it will never be able to loom over a Mexico-U.S.A. soccer match the way it had over this one.","2031","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/donald-trump-makes-mexican-soccer-great-again"

"Hillary Clinton is, so far, the only declared Presidential candidate known to have seen “Hamilton”: she attended a performance of the show at the Public Theatre, in March, to which she responded with evident delight. The musical—as the world knows by now—draws on rap, pop, jazz, and a variety of other musical genres to tell the story of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury, tracing the arc of his life from his illegitimate birth in poverty, in the Caribbean, to his death, in a duel, at the hands of Aaron Burr, the sitting Vice-President. The show, which was composed and written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also takes the title role, was conceived at the start of Barack Obama’s Presidency; its transfer to Broadway, this summer, coincided with the beginning of the end of the Obama years. With its youthful, almost entirely non-Caucasian cast, and its celebration of the possibilities inherent in building a new nation, the poetry of “Hamilton” is a reminder of the gleaming sense of hope that the election of 2008 engendered—still salutary to recall, despite some inevitable disappointment at the reality of prosaic governance during the past seven years.","September 25, 2015","2033","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"The remaining candidates can now listen to “Hamilton,” even if they are too busy visiting Iowa to make a trip to Manhattan: today sees the iTunes release of the “Hamilton” cast album, executive-produced by the Roots, with the CD version to follow in October. This week, NPR has been streaming all two hours, twenty-two minutes, and thirty-five seconds of it on its Web site. Hip-hop aficionados have been scanning the songs for embedded references, while Miranda—whose protean talents include a mastery of the art form known as Twitter—has been retweeting amateur listeners’ efforts at singing snatches of his songs, under the hashtag #Hamiltunes.","2034","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"For the large field of candidates who think themselves fit to run the country, the history of Hamilton—and the history of “Hamilton”—makes the album well worth playing while driving along in the campaign R.V., or at least worth delegating to a bright young staff member to listen to. (Among many other things, “Hamilton” is a celebration of the bright young staff member: it was as General George Washington’s military secretary in the Revolutionary War that the unknown, unconnected Hamilton first rose to any degree of power.) The show will certainly not appeal to all: John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, is on record as having found a CD by the Roots so offensive that he threw it in the trash, a surprisingly wasteful act for a fiscal conservative. And Chris Christie, the pugnacious governor of New Jersey, has plenty of reason not to be amused by the show’s comic-derogatory references to his state: “Everything is legal in New Jersey,” Hamilton and his son, Philip, sigh in unison, before the latter heads off to fight a duel on the western bank of the Hudson. For others, though, the way that the show filters the concerns of the late eighteenth century through the lens of the twenty-first could make for enlightening listening.","2035","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"Prior to Miranda’s reimagining, Hamilton’s most recent efflorescence in popular or political culture, a decade or so ago, was as a hero to neoconservatives. Then, Hamilton was embraced by the likes of David Brooks, the Times’s neocon opinionizer, and Richard Brookhiser, whose 1999 biography celebrated Hamilton as the founding father of American capitalism. Miranda, by contrast, offers an Alexander Hamilton who speaks for the ninety-nine per cent, not the plutocracy. “The have-nots are gonna win this,” he predicts in a melodious interaction with Bishop Samuel Seabury, King George III’s loyal representative, near the beginning of the show. (Hamilton goes on to chastise Seabury: “Don’t modulate the key and not debate with me!” he insists, a line that encapsulates the show’s knowing interplay between musical form and political content.) Candidates who have sought to learn from the neoconservative agenda of the nineteen-nineties, such as Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, should take note. Miranda’s Hamilton is always a man of the people, even when he’s striving to establish the nation’s first bank.","2036","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"In the person of Aaron Burr, the show poses the dilemma of the political aristocrat. Belonging to the Colonial cultural élite by birthright, Burr, as incarnated by the silky Leslie Odom, Jr., is constantly balancing the desire to serve his own ambition with the pressure to honor his legacy. “My mother was a genius / My father commanded respect / When they died they left no instructions / Just a legacy to protect,” goes Burr’s “I am” song, “Wait For It.” Burr’s dilemma might be a familiar one for Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida. As the son and brother of former presidents, Bush is this season’s preëminent legacy candidate—albeit one whose parents are still around, and occasionally issuing unhelpful instructions: Bush’s mother told reporters a couple of years ago that the country had “had enough Bushes.”","2037","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"Miranda’s father, Luis Miranda, Jr., is a long-established Democratic political operative, which informs the way the show gleefully depicts the hypocrisies of political campaigning. “Talk less. Smile more,” is Aaron Burr’s advice to the hotheaded Hamilton when they first meet, in 1776. Burr is still saying the same thing in the Presidential election of 1800, when he actually runs for office, rather than standing for it in apparent disinterest. “I’m going door to door!” Burr tells Hamilton. “Honestly, it’s kind of draining,” he adds, a sentiment that Scott Walker might have sympathy with. Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, dropped out of the race earlier this week, due to lackluster fund-raising. “We didn’t have a spending problem, we had a revenue problem,” was how Walker’s campaign manager,Rick Wiley, defended his own actions, a line that could have come from a satire about a flailing political campaign.","2038","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"“He seems approachable..?” “Like you could grab a beer with him!” is how two members of the public discuss the aspiring Presidential candidate Burr in “Hamilton”—applying the lowest-common-denominator measure of acceptability that recurs in every contemporary campaign. Less than a year ago, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, was publicly fretting that his party needed to nominate a candidate “who someone actually wants to have a beer with,” a stipulation which, if taken literally, at least would rule out Mike Huckabee, the author and commentator, who generated controversy when he told CNN that he neither drinks, swears, nor listens to “classical music or opera—not my cup of tea,” by way of explaining his opposition to gay marriage. Huckabee’s campaign has been characterized by a tone-deafness masquerading as real talk, as when, last month, he criticized the “Black Lives Matter” movement for “elevating some lives above others.” “Hamilton,” with its predominantly black and Latino cast, exposes and detonates the privilege that underlies attitudes like Huckabee’s—never more than in the moment when Jefferson, played by the African-American rapper Daveed Diggs, receiving a letter from Washington in which he is summoned to become secretary of state, airily delegates it: “Sally be a lamb, darlin’, wont’cha you open it?”","2039","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"“Hamilton” repeatedly shows the political risks of speaking one’s mind: Hamilton’s own career in government comes to an end when he publishes a pamphlet criticizing the newly elected President John Adams: “Sit down, John, you fat motherf-” is Miranda’s concise summary of its contents. This year’s Presidential field includes one candidate, Donald Trump, the reality-show star and real-estate mogul, from whom such an approach would not be entirely surprising, though if he were to say such a thing about any rival, he would likely tweet it to his 4.27 million followers, appending a spurious “best wishes.” It’s surprisingly easy to see how certain themes of “Hamilton” might resonate for Trump. Hamilton is a scrappy self-made man, confident of his own cleverness, and disdained by the political élites for his vulgarity: “Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty,” is how Jefferson, foppish and scheming, disparages him. Trump, never shy to announce his own intelligence or to pronounce upon his own accomplishments, might well have the vanity to identify with Miranda’s incandescent hero.","2040","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"To do so, though, would be contrary to the nativist demagoguery by which Trump has thus far propelled himself to prominence. Both at the Public Theatre and on Broadway, audiences have whooped at one moment in the show: when, about to fight the Battle of Yorktown, Hamilton and his French ally, the Marquis de Lafayette—also played by Daveed Diggs—high-five each other over their revolutionary accomplishments and declare “Immigrants, we get the job done.” It’s a feel-good moment for the well-heeled Broadway audience; and there are probably some seats at the Richards Rodgers Theatre occupied by people who, like John Kasich, might resort to citing conversations with the workers hired to clean up after them when asked about the economic prowess of Hispanic-Americans. But that doesn’t diminish the chord that the line strikes with audiences, nor does it negate the potency of the enthusiastic response to it.","2041","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"“Hamilton” is a hymn to the allure that America promises the immigrant who aspires to reach its shores; it is also an argument for the invigorating power that this nation’s porous borders, and porous identity, have always offered. (This week, the Times reported that the nonpartisan National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine had issued the results of a study which showed that immigrants to the U.S. during the past two decades were assimilating to conform to broader cultural norms no less rapidly than did earlier generations of immigrants—including those of Trump’s Scottish mother and of his German grandparents.) Miranda made a few changes to the script between the Public run and the Broadway opening; one is at a moment at which Jefferson, Madison and Burr are seeking to undermine Hamilton’s political career. “Ya best g’wan run back where ya come from,” they tell him, in an echo of the vile rhetoric that has characterized the current campaign. Just as “Hamilton” casts a retrospective gloss upon the Obama years that birthed it, the musical also looks forward to 2016 and beyond, in which the story of America—“you great unfinished symphony,” as Hamilton calls the country in his dying moments—is still being written. Any candidate who ignores its message will be woefully behind the times.","2042","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"

Luckily for the philosopher in me, it turned out to be an auspicious night. Not only, as we did not know then, was President Obama in the midst of the operation that would lead shortly to Osama bin Laden’s killing; it was also the night when, despite that preoccupation, the President took apart Donald Trump, plastic piece by orange part, and then refused to put him back together again.","September 12, 2015","2043","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-obama-a-night-to-remember"
"Trump was then at the height of his unimaginably ugly marketing of birther fantasies, and, just days before, the state of Hawaii had, at the President’s request, released Obama’s long-form birth certificate in order to end, or try to end, the nonsense. Having referred to that act, he then gently but acutely mocked Trump’s Presidential ambitions: “I know that he’s taken some flack lately—no one is prouder to put this birth-certificate matter to rest than the Donald. And that’s because he can finally get back to the issues that matter, like: did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And—where are Biggie and Tupac?” The President went on, “We all know about your credentials and breadth of experience. For example—no, seriously—just recently, in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice”—there was laughter at the mention of the program’s name. Obama explained that, when a team did not impress, Trump “didn’t blame Lil Jon or Meatloaf—you fired Gary Busey. And these are the kinds of decisions that would keep me up at night.”","2044","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-obama-a-night-to-remember"
"What was really memorable about the event, though, was Trump’s response. Seated a few tables away from us magazine scribes, Trump’s humiliation was as absolute, and as visible, as any I have ever seen: his head set in place, like a man in a pillory, he barely moved or altered his expression as wave after wave of laughter struck him. There was not a trace of feigning good humor about him, not an ounce of the normal politician’s, or American regular guy’s “Hey, good one on me!” attitude—that thick-skinned cheerfulness that almost all American public people learn, however painfully, to cultivate. No head bobbing or hand-clapping or chin-shaking or sheepish grinning—he sat perfectly still, chin tight, in locked, unmovable rage. If he had not just embarked on so ugly an exercise in pure racism, one might almost have felt sorry for him.","2045","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-obama-a-night-to-remember"
"Some day someone may well write a kind of micro-history of that night, as historians now are wont to do, as a pivot in American life, both a triumph of Obama’s own particular and enveloping form of cool and as harbinger of—well, of what exactly? A lot depends on what happens next with the Donald and his followers. Certainly, the notion that Trump’s rise, however long it lasts, is a product of a special skill, or circumstance, or a new national “mood,” is absurd. Trumpism is a permanent part of American life—in one form or another, with one voice or another blaring it out. At any moment in our modern history, some form of populist nationalism has always held some significant share—whether five or ten per cent – of the population. Among embittered white men, Trump’s “base,” it has often held a share much larger than that. Trump is not offering anything that was not offered before him, often in identical language and with a similarly incoherent political program, by Pat Buchanan or Ross Perot, by George Wallace or Barry Goldwater, or way back when by Father Coughlin or Huey Long. Populist nationalism is not an eruptive response to a new condition of 2015—it is a perennial ideological position, deeply rooted in the nature of modernity: a social class sees its perceived displacement as the result of a double conspiracy of outsiders and élitists. The outsiders are swamping us, and the insiders are mocking us—this ideology alters its local color as circumstances change, but the essential core is always there. They look down on us and they have no right to look down on us. Indeed, the politics of Trump, far from being in any way new, are exactly the politics of Huck Finn’s drunken father in “Huckleberry Finn”: “Call this a govment! Just look at it and see what it’s like . . . . A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this.” Widespread dissatisfaction with all professional politicians, a certainty of having been “sold out,” a feeling of complete alienation from both political parties—“Not a dime’s worth of difference between them” was George Wallace’s formulation, a half century ago—these are permanent intuitions of the American aggrieved. The feelings may be somewhat aggravated by bad times, or alleviated by good ones, but at the height of the prosperous fifties a significant proportion of Americans were persuaded that the entire government was in the hands of saboteurs and traitors at the pay of a foreign power, while in the still more prosperous nineties a similar faction was persuaded that the liberal President was actually a coke dealer who had murdered a friend.","2046","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-obama-a-night-to-remember"
"Nor is it at all surprising to find a billionaire businessman representing this ideology, because it is not really members of the economic élite who are its villains—it is the educated élite, and the uneducated outsiders, who are. It is, on the historical record, much more a response to the ceaseless anxieties of modern life than to any financial angst of the moment. Probably the best student of this modern ideology is the conservative historian John Lukacs, whose 2005 book “Democracy And Populism: Fear and Hatred” makes clear how different the nationalist formula is from patriotism properly so called: it rests not on a sense of pride in place or background but in an intense sense of victimization. The cry of the genuine patriot is, Leave us alone to be the people we have always been. The populist nationalist cries, We have been cheated of our birthright, and the Leader will give it back.","2047","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-obama-a-night-to-remember"

"And this is where memories of the President’s performance come into play and take on a potency that one might not have understood at the time. For the politics of populist nationalism are almost entirely the politics of felt humiliation—the politics of shame. And one can’t help but suspect that, on that night, Trump’s own sense of public humiliation became so overwhelming that he decided, perhaps at first unconsciously, that he would, somehow, get his own back—perhaps even pursue the Presidency after all, no matter how nihilistically or absurdly, and redeem himself. Though he gave up the hunt for office in that campaign, it does not seem too far-fetched to imagine that the rage—Lukacs’s fear and hatred—implanted in him that night has fuelled him ever since. It was already easy to sense at the time that something very strange had happened – that the usual American ritual of the “roast” and the roasted had been weirdly and uniquely disrupted. But the consequences were hard to imagine. The micro-history of that night yet to be written might be devoted largely to the double life of Barack Obama as cool comedian and quiet commander—or it might be devoted to the moment when new life was fed into an old ideology, when Trump’s ambitions suddenly turned over to the potent politics of shame and vengeance. His even partial triumph in the primary still seems unlikely—but stranger jokes have been played on American philosophers over the centuries.","2049","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-obama-a-night-to-remember"

"Afterward, Trump was widely criticized for not correcting the man, for not acting, in fact, as that “loser” John McCain had, in 2008, when a questioner at one of his rallies described Barack Obama as “an Arab” whom she couldn’t trust. It would seem like the minimal act a decent candidate could undertake. One might ask the other Republicans in the race why they haven’t really found the opportunity to correct Trump—at this point, they’ve been on plenty of stages with him. On Friday, Lindsey Graham said that Trump should apologize for not acting as Graham’s friend McCain did, and Christie said that he would have handled the encounter differently—though he added that he didn’t want to “lecture” Trump. Otherwise, the Republican candidates were slow to speak. Trump is not just someone who stands by when the President’s faith, birthplace, or basic identity are put into question; he pushes that view. As recently as this July, when Anderson Cooper asked Trump if, with all the documentation out there, including a long-form birth certificate, he accepted that the President was born in America, Trump said, “I don’t know.

"But even more outrageous, this week, was Trump’s tolerance of the questioner’s premise: that Muslims in America are “a problem.” Calling Obama a Muslim is not wrong because being a Muslim is bad; it’s wrong because he is a Christian, and so “Muslim” becomes a shorthand for impostor and liar, for deceptive secret agent. Trump, though, went well beyond not defending the President: he affirmed an attack on the millions of Muslim Americans who are as much a part of the national community as anyone else. The man in the T-shirt’s actual point, after all, was about the supposed training camps “where they want to kill us.” He wanted Trump to answer his question: “When can we get rid of them?”","2059","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"
"The campaign did say, according to the Washington Post, that it understood “them” to refer to the “training camps,” not to a potential ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population as a whole. A campaign official also said that Trump was focussed on the part of the question about this larger phantom threat, and not on the part about Obama’s religion—as if entertaining an insult to an entire community, rather than just to the President, were a defense. Trump’s own statement seemed to underscore the man in the Trump T-shirt’s fears: “The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country. Christians need support in this country. Their religious liberty is at stake.” Donald Trump, Christian warrior.","2060","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trump-and-the-man-in-the-t-shirt"

Perhaps his comments in New Hampshire will persuade his competitors to confront his extremism instead. So far, they have been too fearful or too eager for the votes of people like the man in the T-shirt.

"“I don’t mean to be disrespectful,” Donald Trump said, about a dozen insults into his speech in Dallas, at the American Airlines Center, on Monday night. “But when a man has a problem, and he’s got his wife or his girlfriend, and they move her over the border for one day, has the baby on the other side of the border—our side—now that baby is a citizen of our country for however long the baby lives.” Perhaps sensing that the last phrase might sound a bit ominous, he quickly added, “hopefully, a long time,” then continued his immigration-as-paternity-suit-fraud riff: “It’s wrong. It’s wrong. And by the way, by the way, the law doesn’t call that. That’s not what the law says. And people are finding out now that I’m right. We didn’t say that someone could be pregnant for nine months, come across the border, have the baby, and now it’s ours and we have to take care of that baby forever. It doesn’t say that. It does not say that.”","September 15, 2015","2106","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"The law that Trump was referring to was, presumably, the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which is, indeed, not worded in terms of a man having “a problem.” It is phrased like this: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Maybe your parents have just arrived on what is, when you take your first breath, your side of the border. Maybe your ancestors have been here for four hundred years—and, perhaps, for two hundred and fifty of them, until the adoption of that amendment, in 1868, they were, as the Supreme Court affirmed in the notorious Dred Scott decision, deprived of full citizenship themselves because they were held as slaves. (The Fourteenth Amendment voided Dred Scott. It is telling that Mike Huckabee, who has been spuriously attacking the Court’s marriage-equality decision by comparing it to Dred Scott, has also said that he wants the Citizenship Clause abrogated.) In either case, you have what has come to be referred to as “birthright citizenship.” But birthright citizenship has become a contentious issue in the Republican primary race, with outright calls that it should be done away with or disavowed (Trump, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham); that it “doesn’t make any sense” (Ben Carson); that it needs to be “reëxamined” (Chris Christie); or that it is being “taken advantage” of in ways that should be countered (Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush)—or just a waffling unwillingness to defend it (Scott Walker). If there is a single question that the candidates should be confronted about in the debate on Wednesday night, it is the nature of their commitment to birthright citizenship, because there are few issues that reveal more about their ideas of America, and about their willingness to play on the country’s fears and divisions.","2107","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"In the debate, there is likely to be mention of “anchor babies,” a term that serves to hook certain Republican audiences with its insinuations. In his speech in Dallas, Trump moved directly from immigrant criminals—“It’s disgusting what’s happening to our country. We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world”—to “the whole subject of anchor babies,” as if they were mini vectors of destruction. In fact, an American child cannot help his or her parents gain residency until he or she is twenty-one. The suspicion of alien identity attached to the phrase has already moved beyond the realm of rhetoric to affect the lives of American children: some babies born in Texas have had a hard time getting birth certificates, because their parents don’t have proper identification. But what is an “anchor baby”? Insofar as a slur can have a technical definition, it refers to a child born in the United States to parents who are undocumented, whether those parents have been here for years or for a day, and regardless of how long they hope to stay. This definition, at any rate, has been the basis for claims that two, three, or four hundred thousand such babies are born in this country each year. (The Wall Street Journal did a survey of various studies.) But those numbers have, in the Republican campaign, been joined with definitions that are anecdotal and demagogic—like Trump’s talk of a woman practically in labor stumbling over the border for twenty-four hours to give birth, or accounts of “maternity tourism.” Jeb Bush, acting puzzled that anyone thought his use of the term “anchor babies” was an insult to Latinos, said, “Frankly, it’s more related to Asian people—coming into our country, having children in that organized effort, taking advantage of a noble concept, which is birthright citizenship.” Those babies, he said, were involved in a “fraud.”","2108","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"As it happens, fear-mongering about Asian immigrants was part of an early effort, in the eighteen-nineties, to compromise the Fourteenth Amendment. Chinese workers had come to build the railroads and a good part of the state of California; the Chinese Exclusion Act denied them citizenship, but some of them had children here. One of those children was Wong Kim Ark, who was born at 751 Sacramento Street, in San Francisco, in an apartment above his father’s store. Twice, as a young adult, he took trips to China. The first time, in 1890, he was readmitted as a matter of course—he was American. The second time, in 1895, he was denied entry. As Fred Barbash recently recounted in the Washington Post, opponents of Chinese immigration had been looking for a test case that could be used to get courts to do something that, partly because it went against the plain meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, they hadn’t done before: to read the phrase about being born in and “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States as excluding people with foreign parents. Why it would do so is a little baffling: San Francisco was certainly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Wong’s parents, as they went about their business in California, were certainly not exempt from its laws. (The jurisdiction phrase is generally understood to deal with special areas within the United States, such as Native American reservations and embassies.) Part of the argument that the U.S. Attorney trying to deport Wong made was that Wong’s parents were, nonetheless, “subjects” of someone else, namely the Emperor of China—which might be a valid reading of a sentence including a different meaning of the word “subject,” but not the one in the citizenship clause. That the amendment’s language was, in truth, not the heart of the matter was made clear when the U.S. Attorney added, “The said Wong Kim Ark has been at all times, by reason of his race, language, color and dress, a Chinese person.”","2109","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"Wong Kim Ark’s case went to the Supreme Court, and he won. The decision cited the “clear words and manifest intent” of the Fourteenth Amendment. The principle in the decision has since been affirmed and codified. But the idea that there is a qualification to the Citizenship Clause, one that is being ignored by forces willing to see America overrun by foreigners, has gained a sort of murmuring traction. It is what Trump is referring to when he says, “people are finding out now that I’m right.” Last month, Sean Hannity, of Fox News, introduced Mark Levin, the author of “Plunder and Deceit,” a book that argues that the Fourteenth Amendment is being misread, by saying, “Rand Paul was right on this. Trump was right on this. Cruz is right on this. Walker is right on this,” and asking, “Why are so many people getting this wrong?” Levin explained that it was thanks to “some phony constitutional lawyers” focussed on the “results” of greater immigration. He added that anyone who thought otherwise didn’t know “the history.” “Agree completely,” Hannity said. It is as though “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” was just a bar of white noise, which could be filled in with anything—dual citizenship, the illegal crossing of a border, a strange language, religion, or clothing—to ignore the claim of an American child.","2110","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"Ted Cruz says that birthright citizenship should “absolutely” be limited, but he believes that the constitutional arguments on both sides are made in “good faith.” He said on “Face the Nation” that Congress could start by passing “a law defining what the words in the Fourteenth Amendment ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ means,” but that amending the Fourteenth Amendment would be more effective. It might just take a lot of time.","2111","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"One might better ask what vision of America it would require. Trump, in his speech in Dallas, said that he had been told that “anchor babies” was “not a nice term,” but said that it was one “we have to use.” (Hillary Clinton has suggested another option: “babies.”) Trump’s embrace of the phrase points to another use of “anchor baby,” one that seems to tempt candidates like Jeb Bush: as something that cool conservatives can say to show that they are not subject to the jurisdiction of “political correctness”—that they are brave enough to insult babies. But protestations on that count should not, in the debate on Wednesday, substitute for an engagement with the real ugliness of what is being proposed by the frontrunners in the Republican race. Are any of them willing to say that they value, rather than fear, birthright citizenship? Do they envision people with certain names or skin colors being asked not only for their own papers but for those of their parents and grandparents? A better question might be this: since when has the idea that an immigrant hopes that her child will be born in America, because she believes in America, been something to scorn? Aspirations like that have always been the country’s foundation—and, one might say, its true anchors.","2112","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"“He’s perfect!” Drunk Uncle, one of the commentator characters on “Saturday Night Live” ’s Weekend Update said of Donald Trump, who happened to be the host of the show last night. “He’s like a big old beautiful Monopoly man.” Drunk Uncle (played by Bobby Moynihan) blinked at his drink. Trump was “someone who has been saying the things that I have been thinking as well as saying.” And the two of them were so alike, sort of. They both liked White Russians. Trump had a wife named Melania and that was, as far as Drunk Uncle could recollect, what his doctor said his mole was called. As Colin Jost, one of the anchors, tried to quiet him, Drunk Uncle cried out about “crime perpetrated by immigrants.” Then he sniffled some more.","November 8, 2015","2113","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"There was a scenario in which “S.N.L.,” having secured Trump as a host, might have engaged his affinity for self-parody in a way that exposed him more fully than he would have liked. Instead, all they added was a little gold-plating. Trump looked tacky, but we already knew that. The show didn’t, in any truly cutting way, make fun of Trump: it made fun of Trump voters, or at least the people it imagined them to be. Instead of looking for the weakness in the Republican front-runner, the show looked for the weak characters drawn to him. It’s not clear how much is gained, even in the interests of humor, by simply expanding the circle of people called losers in this race, and leaving it at that. The reply might be that you can’t blame the Donald for Drunk Uncle being sad. Trump can’t help it that he has groupies and stalkers. (When Kenan Thompson, playing Toots Hibbert, who was the musical guest the last time Trump hosted “S.N.L.,” in 2004, gets a bit too pushy about wanting to be considered for the Vice-President’s job, Trump says, “You know I carry a gun, don’t you?”). It’s just natural that two porn-actress characters, in the Vote for Donald Tramp sketch, were desperate to get his attention, since, as one said, he’d be in the White House soon, and “I haven’t been there since the nineties.”","2114","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"The show, it should be said, also mocked Trump haters. As it was being broadcast, there were protesters outside the NBC studio, complaining that the network had given him this forum. A group called Deport Racism 2016 had offered five thousand dollars to anyone on the set who would call him a racist. They didn’t really get their money’s worth. Trump wasn’t in the cold-open skit, which made fun of the Democratic candidates at MSNBC’s Southern-voters forum—and was more harshly amusing than anything else in the show—with Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton, switching between regional accents, and Larry David as Bernie Sanders, the role he was born in Brooklyn to play. (“Go to your closet; pull out your vacuum; dump it upside down; and send me all the pennies that fall out of it.”) Trump waited for his monologue to make an appearance. As he began, flanked by two actors who have played him—Taran Killam and Darrell Hammond, in full Trump regalia—someone offstage called out, “You’re a racist!”","2115","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"“Who the hell is—ah, I knew this was going to happen,” Trump said, or rather recited; he made it very clear that the interruption was scripted. “Who is that?” The camera switched to Larry David, now in a white T-shirt and a gray hoodie, who shouted, “Trump’s a racist!”—and then lolled his tongue and grinned quickly, as if to confirm that this was a joke. But a joke on whom?","2116","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"“What are you doing, Larry?” Trump said. David shrugged, and said, “I heard that if I yelled that they’d give me five thousand dollars.” (Deport Racism said in a tweet, after the broadcast, that it still would.) “As a businessman, I can fully respect that,” Trump said. Maybe David thought he got one over on him, but Trump was cagy enough to convey that he didn’t care. (“I loved it,” Trump said, when he was asked about David’s heckling on “Meet the Press.”) Later, on Weekend Update, one of the jokes turned on the supposed parallels between the anti-Trump demonstrators and Iranians shouting “Death to America”: so pathetic, so hilarious. The show also made fun of those who were too weak to decide whether they loved or hated him: the needy types. One skit involved the cast supposedly trying to do a scene at an Italian restaurant but coming undone as “Trump” tweets about them. Mostly, he’s mean, and they crumble; when he’s not, saying that he has “tremendous respect” for Leslie Jones, she instantly declares her love for him, then keens (“Whaaaat!”) when he follows up with “and I love the blacks.” The joke is that none of the actors know what to do with that. That was the point at which the show came closest to acknowledging that it didn’t know what to do with the front-runner, either.","2117","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"Maybe it tried: in a White House scene, an aide talks about the wild success of “all the laws you’ve tweeted,” but it’s not clear if the idea is that the policies are shallow or that Trump’s tweets are awesomely, hysterically powerful. There’s not really a good sense of the distinction. And Cecily Strong’s attempt at a pushy First Lady Melania Trump, which already felt artificial, was thrown off, as was the skit as a whole, when the actual Ivanka, Trump’s daughter, walked in for a cameo as Secretary of the Interior. Everyone in the studio seemed to pause, for half a second too long, to figure out how real Ivanka or any of this was. (Ivanka’s mother, Ivana, was played brilliantly twenty-five years ago by Jan Hooks, who also did a fine job with the Donald’s second wife, Marla; Cecily Strong has not yet quite captured the sculpted diffidence of Melania, though she was a fine Rachel Maddow in the opening.) The skit could have been provocative, but, like much of the show, it got lost.","2118","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"During Trump’s opening monologue, Killam and Hammond mostly stood there, jutting out their lower lips in a way that made them look more like kids at a Halloween party, who have just binge-watched “The Apprentice,” than like effective satirists. They got the costume down, but not the real strangeness of Trump—neither his physical nor his political presence. This is disappointing, because the show should know him so well. Both “S.N.L.” and Trump emerged in the same tabloid-tawdry years: during the show’s first season, in 1975-6,Trump was negotiating his deal for the Commodore Hotel, which would define his business in many ways. Perhaps some institutional knowledge has been lost as the show, and Trump, have become more national, and, perhaps, less alive to New York. When Phil Hartman played him, back in the days when Ivana and Marla were circling each other and Trump Tower was new, he did so without what are now regarded as some of the key tropes (the hair isn’t even close). His Trump, giving Ivana a beautiful giant door as a Christmas gift in 1988, then triumphing over her thanks to an iron-clad pre-nup in 1990, was an almost generically crass New York real-estate guy. And yet, in that, Hartman might have come closer to the heart of the matter.","2119","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"
"Comedy has to find a way to strip Trump bare. A mastery of mannerisms can help to achieve that, as Tina Fey did with Sarah Palin, Will Ferrell did with George W. Bush, and Hartman did as the mastermind Reagan. Sometimes, though, the portrayal just fluffs the hair a bit more. When Trump last hosted the show, eleven years ago, he appeared in a skit about a bullying father, with Seth Meyers as his son and Horatio Sanz and Jimmy Fallon as their neighbors. In it, Trump is dressed in an off-the-rack sports jacket that looks like something Archie Bunker might wear. He is Drunken Dad. In another 2004 skit, based on “The Prince and the Pauper,” he wore a janitor’s uniform. This Saturday, Trump’s costumes included a space-age black number half glimpsed behind a grid of lasers, and, in a brief appearance as a dodgy music promoter, a flashy jacket and glittery earring—more shiny things. And he’s got enough of those.","2120","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/s-n-l-gets-trumped"

"Lately, she has been getting inquiries about the provenance of Donald Trump’s hair style. “The comb-over goes back to ancient Rome, at least,” she said. “Roman comb-overs were not based on the side part, as they are today. To part the hair was an exclusively feminine practice avoided by ‘manly’ Roman men. If a Roman man’s hair was thinning, but still present, he allowed the hair at the crown to grow longer and combed it forward. This type of comb-over is visible on portrait statues of Emperor Hadrian. If a man was hippocratically bald”—hairless on top, like Hippocrates—“he would grow any remaining side hair longer and comb each side up over the top to meet in the middle. These comb-overs were unstable, because of gravity and wind. They were likely held in place with pomade or primitive hair gels made from acacia gum—ancient versions of the hairspray, in other words, that keeps Donald Trump’s signature comb-over in place.","2126","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“I can talk about pretty much every candidate,” Stephens went on. “A few general points: Carly Fiorina, Jim Webb, Ted Cruz, and Trump all would have mocking epigrams written about their dye jobs. Jeb Bush would fit right into the first century A.D., the bridge between the Republic and the principate. Ben Carson looks more like a third-century soldier: he has great dignity, but he doesn’t really resemble any Roman emperors. Chris Christie could be Emperor Vespasian, but he’d have to lose a little more hair. He’d also have to brush forward and trim his bangs. He resembles Vespasian mostly in facial shape and attitude.","2127","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“Ted Cruz would fit perfectly in ancient Rome. Carly Fiorina, absolutely not: short hair was a sign you’d been conquered. Jim Gilmore vaguely resembles Emperor Galba, from the first century. I’m amazed at how many styles Bobby Jindal has had. He’d fit into the Trajanic period, early second century. Perfect throughout the Mediterranean world.”","2128","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"As for Lindsey Graham, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, George Pataki, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, and Rick Santorum, “they’d all be fine in ancient Rome if they combed forward. Rand Paul has a kind of disturbing resemblance to Patrick Stewart in ‘I, Claudius.’ That curly hair with a very slight leftward part: you could just drop him into the middle of ancient Rome and, except for eye color, he’d fit.","2129","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“Scott Walker resembles Emperor Tiberius. Lincoln Chafee bears an interesting similarity to Emperor Trajan, but he’d need a cleft chin.

"With about fifteen minutes to go in the G.O.P. Presidential debate last night, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, it looked as if it might be hard to pick a low point. The candidates had, after all, been squabbling for almost three hours, long enough to foster fantasies of using Reagan’s Air Force One, which was onstage, as an emergency-escape vehicle. Then Jake Tapper, the moderator, asked Ben Carson about vaccines—or, more specifically, what he, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, thought of Donald Trump’s statements linking childhood vaccines to autism, “which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes.” Perhaps Tapper thought that he was setting up a confrontation between rationality and Trumpism, a moment when the doctor would calmly dismantle the Donald. If so, he was disappointed. Carson, after allowing that studies “have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism,” and that some inoculations saved lives, added that “a multitude” of them probably weren’t important—“and there should be some discretion in those cases. But, you know, a lot of this is—is—is pushed by big government.”","September 17, 2015","2135","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"“Should he stop saying that vaccines cause autism?” Tapper asked.","2136","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Trump, Carson replied, was “an intelligent man and will make the correct decision after getting the real facts.”","2137","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Trump proceeded to demonstrate his decision-making qualities with a digressive rant about how he knew “a beautiful child” who “went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.” He’d had his own regimen for his children, he said, spreading things out; if people followed his advice, “I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.”","2138","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"You’re not: the science is very clear that vaccines do not cause autism, and that all the deniers have accomplished is to provoke outbreaks of diseases, like measles, that were once almost forgotten in America. (My colleague Michael Specter has written about this extensively.) A lot of what Trump says—diplomacy by yelling, for example—would be dangerous if put into practice. But most of it, assuming he doesn’t actually get elected, won’t be put into practice. The refusal to inoculate children, though, is something that his admirers can try at home. No other candidate was willing to anger the ideologues by standing up for something as suspicious as science. Given a final chance by Tapper, Carson smiled and said that Trump was “an O.K. doctor”—a reference to Trump’s dismissal of Carson’s surgical skills. Rand Paul, who is also a doctor, added that though he was for vaccines, “I’m also for freedom”—namely the freedom to reschedule shots, “even if science doesn’t say” that there’s a problem.","2139","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The exchange was of a piece with the rest of the debate and with the state of the Republican Party: fervid, claustrophobic, recklessly insinuating, and, at the same time, utterly timid when it comes to extremism in its own ranks. The discussion about vaccines was immediately preceded by one about climate change: Tapper—citing George Shultz, Reagan’s Secretary of State, who said that his boss had urged industry leaders to come up with a plan to move away from chemicals destroying the ozone layer “as an insurance policy in case the scientists are right”—asked Marco Rubio why we shouldn’t now do the same, just in case there was something to the overwhelming evidence of climate change, rising sea levels, and retreating glaciers all around us.","2140","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"“Because we’re not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do,” Rubio said. “Single parents already struggling,” he added, couldn’t afford to do things that, in his view, wouldn’t affect the climate. And anyway, “America is not a planet.”","2141","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Tapper turned to Chris Christie, apparently on the theory that he had previously been more willing than other Republicans to recognize the reality of climate change. He didn’t have much better luck than he did with Carson. “I agree with Marco. We shouldn’t be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate,” Christie said. Not that he was interested in working with others: he bragged that, while making the air cleaner in New Jersey, he’d pulled the state out of regional cap-and-trade agreements. America may not be a planet, but New Jersey is. Scott Walker then jumped in to say that he wouldn’t listen to the E.P.A. Tapper managed to move on, despite Paul’s clamoring to be heard “if you want a skeptic” about climate change. No one tried to break in on behalf of the planet—the one that America is on.","2142","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The flaw in the debate, evident in both of these exchanges, may have been a structural one. In the interests of mixing it up, CNN’s moderators—Tapper was joined by Dana Bash, the network’s political correspondent, and Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio host—repeatedly quoted criticisms that one candidate had made of the others. The most blunt example may have been when Carly Fiorina was asked what she thought of Trump’s comments, to Rolling Stone, about the unelectability of her face. In lieu of an apology last night, Trump said, “she’s a beautiful woman.” (He also said that he’d heard that Jeb Bush’s wife was “lovely.”) Fiorina declined to simper; throughout, she played her designated role of Trump teller-offer, mixing in references to “my good friend Bibi Netanyahu” and lurid (and inaccurate) descriptions of secretly taped videos of Planned Parenthood employees. Later, she and Trump sniped about their respective business records, prompting Christie, of all people, to tell them to “stop playing” and being so “childish.” “And Carly—Carly, listen,” he said. “You can interrupt everybody else on this stage, you’re not going to interrupt me, O.K.?” He sounded like a first grader striking a pose for the kindergartners.","2143","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"But rather than really pushing the candidates on their positions, CNN’s did-you-hear-what-he-called-you approach served to keep the debate within the tinny echo chamber of the G.O.P. For example, Bash asked Jeb Bush, “After Chief Justice John Roberts voted to uphold Obamacare twice, Senator Cruz criticized your brother for appointing John Roberts to the Supreme Court. Looking back on it, did your brother make a mistake?” What followed was a somewhat bizarre exchange in which Bush offered a tepid defense of Roberts while saying that Cruz had supported him, too. Cruz replied by comparing Roberts—who, Obamacare aside, has led the court to achingly conservative decisions in Citizens United and Hobby Lobby, has helped to roll back voting rights, and has written bitter dissents on marriage equality—to the far more liberal David Souter. Mike Huckabee, who had earlier said that Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentucky who is violating the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision by refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, had been afforded less respect for her religious beliefs than “the detainees at Gitmo,” jumped in to expostulate about litmus tests. Only in the Republican primaries would any of this make sense.","2144","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"The Roberts exchange was one of several in which Jeb Bush couldn’t shake a certain air of petulance. “That’s—that’s my brother,” he said at one point, wiggling his arms a little. He had been trying to finish an evocative line about George W. Bush embracing a firefighter in the rubble of Ground Zero, but, since he’d been interrupted with interjections from, in sequence, Trump, Paul, and Walker, it was hard to figure out just what he was saying, or even parse it grammatically. He certainly didn’t command the foreign-policy discussion, amid a general clamor about renouncing the Iran agreement and Trump dismissing the need to learn “name after name, Arab name, Arab name.” Both Rubio and Carson had stronger moments in explaining why they might, if only occasionally, think before bombing, but both still came across as flagrantly hawkish. Paul, meanwhile, communicated the anti-interventionism that has set him apart. (His most effective moment, though, came when he talked about decriminalizing drug offenses, prompting Bush to talk about smoking marijuana as a teen-ager and Fiorina to speak, movingly, about her step-daughter who lost her life to addiction.) Bush said that he had chosen the same foreign-policy advisers that his brother and father had because, if you wanted a Republican, those were the only people available, “just by definition.” Near the end of the debate, Tapper asked each candidate to pick his or her Secret Service code name. (Paul: “Justice Never Sleeps”; Cruz: “Cohiba”; Walker: “Harley. I love riding Harley’s.”) Bush went with “Eveready—it’s very high energy, Donald.” Suddenly, it became hard to shake the image of Jeb as a giant Energizer Bunny. It also made him sound like a sulker, fixated on Trump’s description of him as “low-energy.” Trump, for his part, offered Eveready a hand-slap and then proposed his own name: “Humble.”","2145","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Tapper had another “light question”: What woman should, in accordance with a Treasury Department plan, replace Alexander Hamilton on the ten-dollar bill? Fiorina wouldn’t give a name, saying that she wasn’t in favor of that kind of “gesture.” Others nominated four American historical figures: Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Rosa Parks, and Abigail Adams. The rest of the answers were divided between family members (Huckabee’s wife, Carson’s mother) and foreigners (Bush: Margaret Thatcher; Kasich: Mother Teresa). Really, Miss Oklahoma did a better job with this one than the Presidential contenders. (The correct answer, by the way, is to keep Hamilton on the ten, and put Harriet Tubman on the twenty.)","2146","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Trump went with both Parks and his daughter Ivanka—“because she’s been sitting for three hours.” Do we all get a bill, then? The debate was crowded, bloated, sour, and long. Far from adding order to the race, it is likely to have made it even more unpredictable. As was the case last time, each candidate probably did enough to satisfy his or her narrow faction, or at least to convince a couple of big donors to keep paying. Some (Carson, Fiorina, Rubio) likely did more than that. The question is who will lose the support they gain. Trump’s core supporters may not mind his performance, even though, at times, he seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake, like a truck driver lighting another cigarette. He was missing what he would call his usual “braggadocious” verve. It’s going to be a strange and pot-holed road on the way to 2016. But all we watched, on Wednesday night, were a bunch of bumper cars colliding in front of an old Air Force One.","2147","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-g-o-p-debate-crowded-bloated-sour-and-trump"
"Fifteen years ago, as Philip Roth was reading the galleys of a memoir by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., he came to a passage about the political fevers of 1939-40, when reactionaries like Father Charles Coughlin, Henry Ford, and Charles Lindbergh brandished the twin banners of nativism and isolation. Moderate Republicans, including Wendell Willkie, a corporate lawyer who eventually won the Party’s Presidential nomination, were never likely to topple F.D.R., and some Party grandees wanted Lindbergh to run. Lindbergh was known by then not only as the daring aviator who crossed the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis but also as a bigot so vile that F.D.R., upon reading one of his speeches, remarked that “it could not have been better put if it had been written by Goebbels himself.”","2148","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Next to a passage where Schlesinger raised the question of whether Republicans would put Lindbergh forward at the head of a new Know-Nothing Party, Roth wrote, “What if they had?” That marginal note became the germ for “The Plot Against America,” a counter-factual novel in which Lindbergh is elected President. “Fear presides over these memories,” Roth’s novel begins, “perpetual fear.” Anyone who dares to look past the comedy of Donald Trump’s surreal tweets and Ben Carson’s end-times ruminations will notice that the politics of perpetual fear is, in our times, the stuff of nonfiction.","2149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Last week, the Democrats held their first debate, a five-candidate affair in Las Vegas—an unlikely place to hear denunciations of “the casino-capitalist process.” Still, it was a relatively civil and sober discussion compared with the Republican rodeos. After a year of floundering, Hillary Clinton, cool, well-schooled, forensically skilled, had her best hours as a candidate. Her performance provided relief for her supporters and a potential lure for the undecided. She was, contrary to previous reports, conspicuously human-seeming—funny, passionate, even, at times, rueful of past mistakes—a development that might have robbed her potential rival, Vice-President Joe Biden, of the rationale he needed to make a run. Bernie Sanders, the seventy-four-year-old junior senator from Vermont and unapologetic democratic socialist, spoke in a voice that suggested Larry David, on “Seinfeld,” imitating George Steinbrenner. And yet although Clinton handily won the debate, Sanders largely set the terms, pushing her toward a more full-throated progressive view of income inequality and other issues. (From offstage, the Black Lives Matter movement had an equally serious influence on the discussion of race.)","2150","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Sanders also paused for an act of clever generosity, declaring, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails!” Beaming and extending her hand, Clinton thanked him but did not reciprocate the kindness, swatting him on his weak record on gun control, citing his multiple votes against the Brady bill. And while Clinton totted up her own list of Scandinavian-style domestic goals, such as paid parental leave, she raised a brow at Sanders when he talked of “revolution” and the systemic rot of late capitalism. In case we hadn’t figured it out, Hillary Clinton wants to win.","2151","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"History may look back on the Las Vegas debate as the event that elevated Clinton the way that Barack Obama’s eloquent victory speech after the Iowa caucuses elevated him, nearly eight years ago. It might even be regarded as the moment when she boxed out Biden, raked away the underbrush of Mssrs. Chafee, Webb, and O’Malley, and made Sanders look less like a plausible contender than like a protest candidate who forced his opponent to grapple with a political system poisoned by the outsized influence of an American oligarchy comprising, as the Times has reported, a hundred and fifty-eight families.","2152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"One debate will not erase all of what many voters see as Clinton’s complications: the lingering perception of her sense of moneyed entitlement, her lawyerly slipperiness under questioning, the walled garden of her political circle, her interventionist reflexes, her belatedness on gay marriage, comprehensive immigration, and Wall Street reforms. But if Clinton was not flawless she and her debating partners managed one distinct achievement: they accentuated the chaos, the intellectual barrenness, and the general collapse of their rivals in the Republican Party.","2153","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"

Members of the caucus stepped forward to admit that the hearings on Benghazi were aimed less at uncovering the truth than at burying Hillary Clinton. An ambitious Party loyalist, Paul Ryan, is reluctant to run for Boehner’s chair because the House Republicans are the new Wild Bunch and, as a friend of Ryan’s put it to Politico, “he’s not a f—ing moron.”","2154","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"

Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the only Republicans polling in double digits, daily clear their throats with that ritual preface of modern self-satisfaction—“I am not politically correct”—and then unleash statements, positions, and postures so willfully detached from fact that they embarrass the political culture that harbors them. Trump is willing to say anything—anything racist, anything false, anything “funny”—to terrify voters, or rile them, or amuse them, depending on the moment. The worst of his demagogic arousals are reminiscent of Lindbergh’s speeches at America First rallies and his fear, as he wrote in Reader’s Digest, of a “pressing sea of Yellow, Black and Brown.” Carson, who seems as historically confused as he is surgically skilled, has said that Obamacare is worse than 9/11, “because 9/11 is an isolated incident.” What’s more, the two men’s rivals either fall into line or lack the persuasive powers and the courage to marginalize candidates they know to be dangerous.","2155","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"

If there is a campaign promise in 2016 that is almost sure to be fulfilled, it is that obstructionism and political war will continue, for within the G.O.P. the politics of perpetual fear goes on corroding not just a party but a nation. ♦","2156","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"“So, I say, what the hell have we come to?” Donald Trump said in Fort Dodge, Iowa, on Thursday night. “What have we come to? When we have to believe this kind of stuff. And we’re going to put someone in office who considers himself to have pathological disease?” He was talking, in case one paused to sort through the various candidates, about Ben Carson. “Read the definition in the dictionary of pathological disease!” Trump continued. “And I’m not saying it.

"Carson, Trump explained, had “said terrible things about himself,” a habit entirely alien to Trump. Specifically, Carson has said that, between the ages of thirteen and fifteen, when he was growing up in Detroit, he was prone to violence; he tried to attack his mother with a hammer, hit a friend in the face with a padlock, and stabbed another friend in the stomach with a knife—which, in what Carson has presented as a moment of grace, hit the friend’s belt buckle and snapped. “He defined it as disease,” Trump said, and, indeed, in “Gifted Hands,” Carson writes, “I had what I can only label a pathological temper—a disease—and this sickness controlled me, making me totally irrational. . . . Totally without thinking, when my anger was aroused, I grabbed the nearest brick, rock, or stick to bash someone.” Carson also writes that even though he knew, from reading articles in Psychology Today, that a personality trait like that was generally immutable, he prayed to God to change him, and God did. To which Trump, in Iowa, said, “Give me a break!”","2158","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"“And the people of Iowa believe him?” Trump went on. “It doesn’t happen that way. . . . Don’t be fools. Don’t be fools, O.K.?” He moved away from the lectern, pulled back his jacket, and twisted his own belt up and down to demonstrate, like a latter-day Johnnie Cochran, what would really happen if someone was stabbed in the stomach—if blade and buckle don’t bump, you must vote Trump, so to speak. He then laid out the Trumpized version of the pop-psychology analysis: “Now, if you’re pathological, there’s no cure for that. . . . If you’re a child molester—a sick puppy—if you’re a child molester, there’s no cure for that. There’s only one cure—we don’t want to talk about that cure. That’s the ultimate cure. Well, there’s two, there’s death and the other thing.”","2159","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"This speech in Iowa was so freewheeling (ninety minutes), Trump’s language so crass (“How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?”), his impressions of his rivals so close to outright burlesque (on Marco Rubio: “If he was playing poker with me, I’d say, Ah! I know what. The water would start pouring off his body. I’d say AAAAHHHH.”), that it was hard to do more with that diagnosis than pause and wonder at a Presidential campaign in which the front-runner for a major party’s nomination regales audiences in Iowa with his belief in the efficacy of castrating criminals. (He also called reporters “scum.”) But, since he is the front-runner, there are two other points worth exploring: Trump’s view of people with less luck than he’s had and Trump’s view of Trump. These overlap, but there are distinctions. One is suggested by the option he mentioned besides castration: the death penalty.","2160","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"What does Donald Trump think the fate of an angry, black fourteen-year-old from a poor neighborhood, who has acted in a violent way, should, or possibly could, be? In 1989, he took out an ad in the Daily News calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of fourteen-, fifteen-, and sixteen-year-olds who had been accused of raping and beating a jogger in the park. As I wrote in a piece about the case last year, he did not back away from that position even when the boys, now men, were exonerated, after serving years in prison—they were not, he said, “angels.” As a candidate for the 2016 G.O.P. Presidential nomination, what does he think about the possible effect on a child of education, support, rehabilitation, or even, in Carson’s terms, redemption? Not much, it would seem. Trump doesn’t particularly believe in working with what’s broken—this is the same impulse that caused him to say, in insulting John McCain, that he didn’t like people who had been taken prisoner. He likes what’s never been touched. Even more telling than “pathological” was another term he used about Carson: “Damaged . . . lot of damage.”","2161","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"
"The other striking thing about the Iowa speech is Trump’s—Trump’s!—dismay that voters would go for someone with no political experience who tells inflated stories about himself. But as the Daily News ad suggests, Trump has been thinking about politics for a long time—longer, it may turn out, than is good for America. Similarly, Jon Meacham’s new biography of George H. W. Bush, about Trump letting Lee Atwater, the Republican operative, know during the 1988 race that he was available for the Vice-Presidency, is not an anomalous data point in this regard. His ideology is not particularly coherent—a medley in his Iowa speech about immigration and foreign policy concluded with this memorable sentence: “If you’ve got to cross a border, if you have your choice between North Korea, Afghanistan, or Iran, I’d take Canada every single time.” (The events in Paris are unlikely to make his ideas more sensible or kind.) But he hasn’t only recently wandered into the arena, making it harder to count on him getting bored and wandering off. In Iowa, Trump also mentioned that he owned a single store that was worth more than Mitt Romney’s entire fortune. Apparently, this is true. The store is the Gucci flagship, in Trump Tower—“Fifth Avenue real estate, it’s amazing,” Trump said. Just when you think Trump has said something entirely delusional, or outright crazy, you realize that New York real-estate prices are crazier still. And so is this Presidential race.","2162","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-pathological-view-of-ben-carson"

"You might suppose that the answer to that question, which was no until a few days ago, is now yes—the yes-man being Paul Ryan, the promising young fellow who achieved global fame as Mitt Romney’s running mate. But it would be a mistake to conclude that Ryan is “running,” or ever truly “ran,” for Speaker. He said often enough and feelingly enough that he didn’t want the job. What he did do, eventually, was to express a tentative, reluctant willingness to be Speaker: he allowed that, if certain conditions were met, he would condescend to accept. He didn’t run for Speaker; he invited the Speakership to run for him. It did, and now he must be wondering if it will run him over. He may yet end up roadkill, a sail cat on the highway to oblivion.","2170","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"The week before last, when Ryan was in full agonizing mode, here was the headline on page one of the Times:","2171","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Latest Unease On Right: Ryan Is Too Far Left","2172","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"The story, by Jennifer Steinhauer, reported that “far-right media figures,” with encouragement from Tea Party extremists in the House, were on a “furious Internet expedition” to cover Ryan in “political silt” on account of his history of being “traitorous to conservatism.” To be sure, Ryan is on board with outlawing gay weddings and nearly all abortions, privatizing Social Security, voucherizing Medicare, abolishing Medicaid and replacing it with ever-diminishing block grants to the states, and ignoring global warming. His famously wonky budget proposals would shrink food stamps and college aid while cutting rich people’s taxes, in many cases by half. He requires his interns to read “Atlas Shrugged.” His treason consists solely of what Steinhauer calls “flashes of pragmatism,” such as questioning the wisdom of shutting down the government and/or forcing the Treasury to default on its obligations.","2173","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"After his announcement of availability, Ryan found himself facing an unappetizing choice. He could compromise (i.e., surrender) on some of his demands, such as his unrealistic insistence on getting the formal endorsement of every single House Republican faction—thus suggesting that he buckles under pressure. Or he could stick to his guns (as is his right under the Second Amendment), withdraw, and be blamed for consigning his party to endless chaos, failing to step up in the hour of Republican need, etc. He chose the former.","2174","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"But there’s still time—the vote isn’t until next Thursday. And there’s an escape hatch—for Ryan in particular and the Republican Party in general.","2175","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Let’s go to the Constitution. “The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker,” Article I, Section 2 says—without adding “from among its Members” or something to that effect. This was almost certainly a drafting error, an inadvertent omission. But its undisputed effect is to leave the House free to “chuse” anyone it chooses.","2176","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"This provision, or lack of provision, has been widely noted, and there was some early, desultory talk of taking advantage of it. One name that was tossed out was that of J. C. Watts, a former four-term congressman from Oklahoma, now a lobbyist. Diversity-wise, Watts would be what might be called the Ben Carson option, with football substituted for brain surgery. But Watts has a fatal taint: he has held public office. In the government. The federal government.","2177","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"There’s a better way.","2178","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Donald Trump fulfills the constitutional requirements for the Speakership, because there are none. Also, Speakers speak, and Trump is very good at speaking, as he has regularly proved on television, not only as a budding politician but also as a “reality” star—and reality, with or without scare quotes, is something of which the Republican Party is sorely in need.","2179","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Another thing Speakers are supposed to do—according to good-government types, bipartisanship junkies, and even the unknown but not insubstantial number of Republicans who suspect that it may be politically advantageous to at least show an interest in “governing” and “getting things done”—is make deals, as long as said deals are struck by a “tough negotiator.” Sound like someone you know? Someone like, maybe, the best-selling author of “The Art of the Deal”? Like the guy who, just last week, bluffed CNBC into immediately yielding to his demand that the next G.O.P. debate be an hour shorter and an opening statement longer?","2180","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"A Trump Speakership would be a win-win for all concerned. For the rest of the Republican Presidential field, “establishment” (Bush, Rubio, Kasich, etc.) and “insurgent” (Cruz, Huckabee, etc.) alike, it would eliminate a dangerously unpredictable, ideologically inscrutable, incomprehensibly popular rival who makes the others look like flop-sweat-covered, low-energy professional politicians hopelessly in hock to rich contributors and corporations. (The Ben Carson problem would persist for a while, of course, but, sooner or later, the doctor’s profound weirdness, among other problems, may be relied upon to dispose of that one.)","2181","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"As for Ryan, the deal would spare him the doom that very likely will be his fate if he becomes Speaker. Nothing about the terms under which he has agreed to accept the post changes the fact that, absurd as the notion may be, he is still “too far left.” For a small but procedurally decisive segment of his Republican colleagues in the House, governmental dysfunction, gridlock, paralysis, and chaos are features, not bugs. These features of the status quo are not about to go away. Ryan’s political business plan called for him to spend the next four years as the respected (among conservatives) chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, followed by eight triumphant years in the White House, followed by a comfortable retirement at the Ryan Presidential Library and Foundation. The prospect for him now is a short, harrowing, career-ending interval of misery on Capitol Hill followed by a lucrative but soul-killing job as a K Street lobbyist.","2182","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"For Trump himself, the deal is just as good. Let’s start with an assumption: notwithstanding the current hysteria, Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee. He can go down in the annals of politics and entertainment as a curiosity, a footnote: the flamboyant mogul who ran for President on a lark, threw a scare into the regulars for a while, got bored and/or boring, and went back to his perch at Trump Tower and the tabloids. Or he can be the first and only non-member of the House of Representatives to be its Speaker in the two hundred and twenty-six years since its founding. He probably wouldn’t last long in the job, and he probably wouldn’t want to, and, anyway, he wouldn’t have to. No matter what, he will have become a truly historic figure, and he can spend the rest of his life preening as such.","2183","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Not only that: Speaker Trump could continue to nurse his White House fantasies. It’s true that, for a conventional politician, the Speakership has always been a too-slippery steppingstone to the Presidency. Being a governor, a senator, or a victorious general has always been a better route. Ex-Speakers Henry Clay and James G. Blaine managed to make it as far as winning their respective parties’ nominations, but they got creamed in November. Of the sixty-one Speakers so far, only one has ever actually become President: James K. Polk—and he had quit the House six years earlier to take the governorship of Tennessee. But, for a conventional Republican politician like Ryan, given the nihilistic ungovernability of today’s G.O.P. caucus, the Speakership is a gravestone. Hence the man’s reluctance.","2184","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"
"Trump, however, is not a conventional politician. A few months as Speaker would be just the dollop of “government experience” he needs to fill out his résumé for next time. Nor could this time be entirely ruled out. The Speaker of the House is third in line for the Presidency. An accident or some such could befall whoever is President and Vice-President. As Jeb Bush recently noted, stuff happens.","2185","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paul-ryans-trump-card"

"The United States has not distinguished itself in the Syrian refugee crisis. Out of some twelve million people displaced by the war—half of Syria’s population—four million have fled the country. Most are living in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and northern Iraq. This year, with no hope that the war in Syria will end soon, hundreds of thousands have headed to Europe, risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean in overloaded boats or on a long overland route through the Balkans. And they are only part of the larger migrant crisis roiling Europe. At this point, every country in Europe is struggling, at least politically, with the influx, but the German government, taking the lead, has said that it expects eight hundred thousand asylum-seekers, the bulk of them Syrians, to arrive this year, and half a million more each year for the next several years. It has already budgeted an extra six billion euros for resettlement this year. Meanwhile, the United States, which is twenty-six times the size of Germany, has accepted fifteen hundred Syrian refugees in four years. The Obama Administration recently announced that it would raise the number to ten thousand over the next fiscal year. The application process for asylum here takes about two years.","October 2, 2015","2191","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-the-refugees"
"Even so, Donald Trump declared, on Wednesday night, at a high school in New Hampshire, “If I win, they’re going back.” He meant, of course, if he wins the Presidency next year. The crowd whistled and cheered—the loudest applause of the night, according to the Washington Post. “Did you ever see a migration like that?” Trump mused. “They’re all men, and they’re all strong-looking guys … And I’m saying to myself, why aren’t they fighting to save Syria? Why are they migrating all over Europe? Seriously.” (Slightly more than half of the Syrian refugees in the United States are male; slightly more than half of all Syrian refugees are female, according to the United Nations; many are also children.) Declining to cite a source, he said, “I hear we want to take in two hundred thousand Syrians.” These refugees would have “no identification.” They could be anyone. “They could be ISIS, I don’t know”—Islamic State terrorists. The extremely stringent vetting of asylum-seekers by the United States, which includes background checks and interviews, seemed to be something Trump hadn’t heard about. “Military tactics are very interesting,” he said. “This could be one of the great tactical ploys of all time. A two-hundred-thousand-man army, maybe. Or if they sent fifty thousand, or eighty thousand, or a hundred thousand, we got problems, and that could be possible. I don’t know that it is, but it could be possible, so they’re going back. They’re going back.”","2192","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-the-refugees"
"Where “back” might be is not clear. Details are not Trump’s thing. In fact, Trump has been going out of his way to denigrate the very idea of foreign-policy expertise. Last week, he told CNN that he knows more about Syria than does Senator Marco Rubio, who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Look, Marco Rubio sits behind a desk sometimes, and he reads stuff, and he’s in committees. That’s all he does.” Trump’s expertise is different: “I know about us beating ISIS and us trying to knock out ISIS, and them wanting to go against Assad, and Assad saying, ‘I can’t believe it, Americans are killing my enemy, this is the greatest thing happening to me.’ ” Beyond that, Trump knows better than to be specific. “Marco Rubio wants to tell every single thing that he knows to everybody, so that the people on the other side, so that the enemy can learn all about it. I want to be unpredictable.”","2193","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-the-refugees"
"Trump’s promise to deport Syrian legal residents is a minor commitment compared with his unprecedented plan to deport eleven million undocumented immigrants—and, it has to be assumed, a good many of the four and a half million children who are American citizens but dependent on undocumented parents. Trump has said that it will take two years max, with “really good management.” Pressed for specifics about this plan by Scott Pelley on “60 Minutes,” last weekend, he said, “We’re rounding them up in a very humane way, in a very nice way.” Pelley asked to hear more about this “roundup”: “How does it work? Are you going to have cops going door-to-door?” Trump, never predictable, countered, “Did you like Eisenhower? Did you like Dwight Eisenhower as a President at all?” Pelley seemed stumped. “He did this,” Trump said. “He did this in the nineteen-fifties with over a million people, and a lot of people don’t know that, and it worked.” Trump was referring to a 1954 mass deportation called, unbelievably, Operation Wetback. The government’s claims to have deported a million undocumented Mexican immigrants have been debunked by historians. A real reduction in the numbers of the undocumented was accomplished, according to Kelly Lytle Hernández, a history professor at U.C.L.A., by “the operation’s parallel but lesser-known campaign to legalize authorized farm workers.”","2194","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-the-refugees"
"Operation Wetback was no more humane than its name. People were dumped in deserts and cities far from their homes, often without water. Crowded, filthy ships carried people from Port Isabel, Texas, to the Mexican port of Veracruz until five desperate deportees jumped overboard and drowned. Trump’s plan is actually unprecedented only in scale.","2195","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-the-refugees"
"Still, its political shortsightedness is astounding, and the idea that we would revert to the unsuccessful immigration-control methods of a dubious 1954 campaign is absurd and depressing. Mitt Romney, who knows something about alienating Latino voters in Presidential races, gave a speech this week at Georgetown University. He deplored the way that the Republican Presidential field has been pulled to the right on immigration by Trump’s race-baiting. He noted that various candidates have now said things “that some minority populations look at and say, ‘Wow, I guess they don’t like me very much.’ ” You almost have to miss the Mittspeak.","2196","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-the-refugees"
"But it’s the whistling and cheering in the New Hampshire high school that echo loudest. A nontrivial number of Americans are looking for someone, preferably someone foreign, to kick. The undocumented, without whom our economy would downtick into serious disarray, make attractive kickees, but helpless Syrian refugees will also do. They’re probably Muslim, after all. It’s not the most Christian posture. It flies in the face of the plea that Pope Francis made to Congress last week to confront the refugee crisis in a “humane, just, and fraternal” way. Christ himself was blunt on the subject of hospitality. “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ ” That’s harsh, eternal fire, but the point is taken. A stranger hoves into view, in need of help. You offer it or you don’t. Nativism—fear and loathing of the stranger—is a global phenomenon. Every country in Europe has its anti-immigrant party, or wing of a party. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France, has a better shot at real power than Donald Trump does. But these are not our better angels. We could, and should, take many more Syrian refugees.","2197","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-the-refugees"

Ramos, who is fifty-seven, is slim, not tall, with white hair and an unassuming demeanor. Wearing jeans, a gray sports coat, and a blue open-collared shirt, he went unremarked. But then, as he disembarked, a fellow-passenger, a stranger in her thirties, drew him aside at the terminal gate, speaking rapidly in Spanish. Ramos bowed his head to listen. The woman was a teacher at a local technical college. Things in this part of Iowa were bad, she said. People were afraid to leave their houses. When they went to Walmart, they only felt comfortable going at night. Ramos nodded. Her voice was urgent. She wiped her eyes. He held her arm while she composed herself.

When we are better represented politically, that role for us will recede.”","2203","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Besides co-anchoring the nightly news, and cranking out books, Ramos hosts a Sunday-morning public-affairs show, “Al Punto” (“To the Point”), and writes a syndicated column; for the past two years, he has also hosted a weekly news-magazine show, “America with Jorge Ramos,” in English, on a fledgling network (a joint venture of Univision and ABC) called Fusion. (When Jon Stewart asked him, on “The Daily Show,” to account for his hyperactivity, Ramos said, “I’m an immigrant. So I just need to get a lot of jobs.”) His English is fluent, if strongly accented. His Spanish, particularly on-air, is carefully neutral—pan-Latino, not noticeably Mexican.

"Ramos occupies a peculiar place in the American news media. He has won eight Emmys and an armload of journalism awards, covered every major story since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and interviewed every American President since George H. W. Bush. (He’s interviewed Barack Obama half a dozen times.) But his affiliation can work against him. In June, when he sent a handwritten letter to Donald Trump, who had just launched his Presidential campaign, requesting an interview, it was no dice. Univision had cut its business ties with Trump, including its telecasts of the Miss U.S.A. and Miss Universe beauty pageants, after Trump accused Mexico of sending “rapists” to the United States. Trump posted Ramos’s letter on Instagram, crowing that Univision was “begging” him for interviews. The letter included Ramos’s personal cell-phone number, which Ramos was then obliged to change. In the weeks that followed, Trump produced a stream of provocative remarks and proposals about Mexicans and immigration, giving the national immigration-policy debate the hardest edge it has had in generations. Now Ramos really wanted to interview him.","2205","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Trump was planning a rally on Dubuque’s riverfront that afternoon. Ramos and Dax Tejera, a young Fusion executive producer, met up with a local cameraman in the parking lot of the Grand River Center, where a press conference was scheduled in advance of the rally. They went inside early, past some tables where Ann Coulter, who was going to introduce Trump at the rally, was setting up to sign copies of her latest book, “¡Adios, America!: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole.” Ramos, heading upstairs, said, “We had her on our show when that book came out. Trump seems to be getting his ideas from her.”","2206","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"In the room designated for the press conference, Ramos and Tejera considered camera angles and lighting. They staked out a pair of front-row seats. Ramos was studying a sheaf of notes. “Normally, I’d just have a ten-second question prepared,” he said. “But this is not normal. Here I have to make a statement, as an indignant immigrant. Tell him that Latinos despise him. And then I have to ask a question, as a journalist, if he’ll let me.” The room was filling with reporters. Ramos worried that Trump would recognize him and not call on him. “It will be important to stand up,” he said. “Trump’s street-smart. If you’re sitting, he’ll use it, the visual power imbalance, and squash you.” Tejera stationed the cameraman against a wall. “TV is not reality,” Ramos said, miming a frame with his hands. “It’s a way of exaggerating a moment. Reality is what we’re living here. What we’re after is something else.”","2207","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"

"Carl Cameron, of Fox News, asked about a local campaign operative who was leaving Rick Perry’s campaign for Trump’s. The operative joined Trump at the lectern for a couple of questions. Then, as Trump stepped back to the microphone alone, Ramos stood up. “Mr. Trump, I have a question about immigration,” he said. Trump ignored him, scanning the room as if no one had spoken, saying, “O.K., who’s next?” He pointed at someone. “Yeah. Please.”","2209","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"

"The bodyguard went for Ramos, who was still talking. “Those ideas—” The bodyguard, who was a foot taller than Ramos, began to push him backward, out of the room. “I’m a reporter,” Ramos said. “Don’t touch me, sir.” His voice did not rise. “You cannot touch me.” The bodyguard had him by the left arm and was now moving him swiftly toward an exit door.","2220","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"

"In the hallway outside, a middle-aged white man, his face flushed with anger, approached Ramos, jabbing a finger at him. “Get out of my country,” he said. “Get out.” The man had a Trump sticker on his lapel. Ramos studied him curiously. “I’m a U.S. citizen, too,” he said, moving toward the man, as if he wanted to talk. A police officer stepped between them.","2227","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Tejera was on the phone to his boss at Fusion. Ramos, standing alone, seemed to fold into himself. His expulsion had been tense, uncomfortable, heart-pounding stuff. Everyone involved was surely agitated. But Ramos seemed calm, as if his pulse had slowed. A young woman with a news camera approached him for an interview. Perhaps later, he said. Ramos crossed his arms and stared at his shoes. He was wearing pale, low-cut boots. His feet looked very small. I later asked him what he was thinking about then. “I was trying to understand what it meant,” he said. “Trying to know if I had made mistakes. I knew it was right not to sit down. If I had sat down, Latinos would have been so disappointed.”","2228","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"After about ten minutes, a Trump aide, a young woman in black, appeared and walked toward Ramos. “I’m Hope,” she said, smiling and extending a hand, which he took. She invited him to return to the press conference, assuring him that he could ask questions. He just had to wait to be called on. Ramos went back in.","2229","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"While he was outside, two reporters had asked Trump about his ejection. The first, Tom Llamas, of ABC, was a young Latino correspondent from Miami. He described Ramos as “one of our country’s top journalists,” and asked Trump if he thought he had handled the situation correctly. Trump said, “I don’t know really much about him.” He only knew he hadn’t called on the guy. “He just stands up and starts screaming,” Trump said. Anyway, he said, he hadn’t thrown him out: “You’ll have to talk to security. Whoever security is escorted him out.”","2230","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Now Trump called on Ramos, who asked his questions about the wall, birthright citizenship, and mass deportation. How was Trump actually going to do these things? Did he plan to use the Army to round up eleven million people? “We’re going to do it in a very humane fashion,” Trump said. “I have a bigger heart than you do.” The two men talked over each other, with Ramos still asking for specifics. Trump now seemed to know who Ramos was. “You and I will talk,” he said. “We’re going to be talking a lot over the years.” He meant, it seemed, when he was President. “Do you know how many Hispanics work for me?” Trump asked. “They love me.”","2231","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The exaggerated TV moment, I guessed, was “Go back to Univision.” It sounded like “Go back to Mexico.” Trump, rehashing the episode on the “Today” show, called Ramos a “madman.” He told a cheering crowd in Nashville about how he had dealt with the “screaming and ranting” of “this clown, Jose Reyes, or whatever the hell his name is.” The media critic Howard Kurtz, of Fox News, said that Ramos had behaved “like a heckler,” contravening “basic civility” by not waiting to be called on. Marc Caputo, of Politico, assailed Ramos’s open support for immigration reform, tweeting, “This is bias: taking the news personally, explicitly advocating an agenda.” Many conservative commentators, at Fox and elsewhere, agreed. A Washington Post writer called Ramos a “conflict junkie”—like Trump himself. Ramos had his defenders. Glenn Greenwald wrote a piece for The Intercept with the headline “Jorge Ramos Commits Journalism, Gets Immediately Attacked by Journalists.” Greenwald and others pointed to a distinguished tradition of opinion and advocacy in American journalism, running from Thomas Paine through Edward R. Murrow. For those with little patience for the numbing rituals of the modern press conference, Ramos’s insistence on making unwelcome points had been refreshing, and it was Trump’s heavy-handed response that was worrisome. Certainly, the questions raised by Ramos had been unusually serious and substantial at a press event otherwise dominated by talk of poll numbers, campaign operatives, and personal spats.","2232","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos’s problem with authority began, in Mexico, with priests. The Benedictine fathers who taught him at school, he said, were reactionary sadists. “They hit us with shoes. They were pulling us from the hair,” he told me, demonstrating with a twisting temple-area hair grab. He is anticlerical to this day. His father, an architect, was rigid and unyielding, and wanted Jorge, his oldest son, to become an architect, a lawyer, a doctor, or an engineer. “It was the same in the country as a whole, with each President imposed by his predecessor, not elected,” Ramos said. “I felt like I had three huge authority figures imposing their rules on me from the time I was a child.” Ramos defied his father and majored in communications in college, working at a travel agency and a radio station. He got interested in journalism and, after graduation, switched to television, becoming a news writer and then an on-air reporter. His employer was Televisa, Mexico’s largest media conglomerate. Once, for a story about Mexican political psychology, Ramos interviewed people critical of the government. But Televisa was slavishly loyal to the Mexican government, and, Ramos said, “My boss was horrified. He told me, ‘No son de la casa’”—they are not our people. “He completely changed my story, and I resigned in protest. I wish I still had the letter I wrote.”","2233","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"We were eating sushi in a crowded little Venezuelan restaurant in Doral, Florida, near Miami’s airport and Univision’s news studios. “Ask any immigrant about arriving here,” Ramos said, waving his chopsticks. “They can tell you the exact date, time, circumstances, everything they first noticed.” He arrived in 1983, shortly after quitting Televisa. He had sold his first car, a VW Beetle, to buy a plane ticket to Los Angeles. “I still have the guitar I carried through the airport. I was twenty-four, almost completely broke, with everything I owned in one bag. I had a student visa, and I remember thinking, This is freedom. You can carry everything you own.” He studied television and journalism in an extension course at U.C.L.A., working part time as a waiter and at a movie house. Then he got his first job in American journalism, as a reporter at KMEX, a Spanish-language TV station that operated out of an old house on Melrose Avenue. “We did three stories a day from the street. It was the best possible training. I did hundreds of stories there.”","2234","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"KMEX was also Ramos’s introduction to the community role that the Spanish-language media fills, and is expected to fill, in the United States. The station sponsored health fairs and job fairs, and broadcast English lessons. People called the station to ask which school to send their children to, which doctor to go to. “That TV is your window into the new world you’re in, where you don’t have many friends,” a Cuban-American media consultant in Coral Gables told me. “Those stations are more than information sources. They’re certainly more than businesses. The on-air personalities become like old friends. If you get ripped off, you don’t call the cops, you call Univision or Telemundo. They have these watchdog shows—here in Miami, it’s ‘El 23 a Tu Lado’ [‘23 on Your Side’]. That’s activist journalism.”","2235","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"KMEX was owned by the Spanish International Network, which later became Univision. In 1985, Ramos began hosting a morning show, in addition to his reporting, and a company executive, visiting Los Angeles, happened to see it. “Rosita Peru,” Ramos recalled. “She invited me to come to Miami to start a national morning show. I said, ‘Sure.’ I moved, and I did that show for eleven months. It was so difficult. There was no script. It was a lot of improvising on-air. Two hours a day. I wanted to be doing news. But I never even saw the people in the news operations. They would just be coming to work as I was crawling out the door.”","2236","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Univision had a Mexican flavor—it had been launched as a subsidiary of Televisa, and the bulk of its programming was, and still is, telenovelas made by Televisa. About a year after Ramos got to Miami, Televisa’s owner, Emilio Azcárraga Milmo, a formidable monopolist known as El Tigre, made a move on Univision’s news department. The plan was to install Jacobo Zabludovsky, Televisa’s main news anchor, as the director of Univision’s news operations. Zabludovsky, a reedy government mouthpiece with rectangular eyeglasses, was one of the most famous men in Mexico, although he is now remembered for having opened a newscast in October, 1968, after the police and the military had massacred scores of protesting students in the plaza at Tlatelolco, in Mexico City, by intoning, “Today was a sunny day.”","2237","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Zabludovsky came to Miami, arriving at Univision’s modest studios in a black limousine. His meeting with the news department did not go well. There was a newsroom revolt. Besides the prospect of a journalistic calamity—the imposition of Mexican-style censorship—there was, according to Ramos, the Cuba-Mexico problem. Mexico recognized Fidel Castro’s regime—indeed, the two countries enjoyed warm relations—which made the Mexican government anathema to many of South Florida’s Cuban exiles. The Miami Herald sharply questioned the Televisa takeover of Univision’s news department. To make matters worse, Zabludovsky had accompanied Castro on his march into Havana during the revolution, providing enthusiastic coverage. The misbegotten plan to install Zabludovsky was finally scuttled when most of the Univision news department simply quit. El Tigre was soon forced by federal authorities to sell his stake in Univision under a law forbidding foreign ownership of broadcast stations.","2238","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The skeleton crew that remained at Univision needed, among other things, a nightly-news anchor. “So they went and found the only on-air male still on the premises,” Ramos recalled. That was the skinny kid on the morning show, the güerito. “I didn’t even know how to read a teleprompter, which in those days was just a roll of paper that constantly jammed.” He got help from an experienced co-anchor, Teresa Rodriguez. “Teresa saved me. She had blood-red fingernails and she used to run her nail down the backup script on our desk, to help me keep my place.” Rodriguez went on maternity leave—she now co-hosts a Sunday-evening news-magazine show, “Aquí y Ahora” (“Here and Now”)—and Ramos ended up co-anchoring with María Elena Salinas, a dynamic newscaster from L.A. whom Ramos had first met at KMEX. The two of them clicked. Twenty-seven years later, they are still working side by side, and are the best-known newspeople, perhaps the best-known faces, among the fifty-five million Latinos now in the United States.","2239","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Salinas has also won a slew of journalism awards, including, in 2012, an Emmy for lifetime achievement and, earlier this year, a Peabody for a special on the exodus of Central American children to the United States.","2240","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Miami was quite different when he first arrived, Ramos said. “It wasn’t always easy to be Mexican here. Cubans ran the place. They understood how the system worked. They had the Cold War policy that said that any Cuban who made it to the U.S. was automatically legal. There were no undocumented Cubans. Local mass media focussed on Fidel, and people were suspicious of any other point of view. I had trouble just because I was Mexican. But then the city began to change, to diversify, first with Central American immigrants fleeing the civil wars there. Next came the Colombians, getting away from the cocaine wars. Then came the Venezuelans, running from Hugo Chávez.”","2241","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"As a Univision co-anchor, Ramos found that he had the media weight to arrange interviews with heads of state, particularly in Latin America. It was also part of his mandate. His viewers were hungry for news from their home countries. Ramos wanted an interview with Castro, but Castro granted very few, and those were given to sympathetic journalists. So Ramos contrived to encounter him outside a hotel in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he was attending an Ibero-American summit, in 1991. With his camera rolling, Ramos, calling Castro “Comandante,” asked him if Marxism was not a museum piece. Castro slowed and put his arm around Ramos’s shoulders and said he didn’t think so. Marxism was young, while capitalism was three thousand years old. Ramos eluded Castro’s arm, acutely aware that it compromised him as a reporter and that the Cubans in Miami would never forgive him if he let it stay there—something Castro himself probably knew quite well, Ramos thought. Castro’s bodyguards moved in. Ramos quickly asked another question, about the fall of the Berlin Wall. Castro countered with a reference to the modest wall then being built by the United States along the Mexican border, and put his hand on Ramos’s shoulder. Ramos then pointed out that many people believed that it was time for Castro to hold a plebiscito in Cuba—a referendum on his rule. Castro responded politely, but Ramos had gone too far. Castro’s bodyguards edged him out of the way. Ramos lost his balance and fell down. Castro kept walking, saying nothing, and didn’t look back. The interview had lasted a minute and three seconds.","2242","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Univision now covers Cuba as a matter of course. Ramos never did get a formal interview with Fidel, but in 1998 he went to Cuba to cover the visit of Pope John Paul II. He tried to convey the country’s complexity in his dispatches, but he ignored the advice of government minders not to give too much attention to dissidents, and he has been blackballed ever since.","2243","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"María Elena Salinas told me that, in his interviews with Latin-American leaders, Ramos used to routinely ask, “Is Fidel a dictator?” She laughed. “People would say, ‘Why are you always asking the same question?’ It was because he wanted these heads of state on the record.” His other standard question with Presidents, she said, is “How much money do you have?” “He likes to ask it when they first come into office, and then a second time, a few years later, if they agree to talk again, to see how much they’ve been stealing.”","2244","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos’s questions often infuriate his interviewees. In Bogotá, in 1996, he demanded that the Colombian President, Ernesto Samper, explicitly state whether or not his election campaign had accepted drug money, and showed Samper a photograph in which he appeared with two alleged narco-traffickers. Samper was annoyed. Ramos and his crew had already received death threats after a prior interview with Samper, and they fled the country on the first available flight. Ramos calls Miami mi trinchera—his foxhole, into which he can jump when there is trouble. As a child of Mexico, he says, he never takes for granted the protections he enjoys as an American. (He became a citizen in 2008.)","2245","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"In a 1994 interview with Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the deeply feared Mexican President, Ramos asked Salinas if he had gained office by fraud, as many Mexicans believed. Ramos pressed him on regional vote totals that were mathematically impossible. He questioned Salinas closely about the murder, a few months earlier, of his anointed successor, Luis Donaldo Colosio. (Salinas moved to Ireland after his term ended, amid persistent reports that he did so to avoid murder charges in the Colosio case.) “It was unbelievable that I could sit there and confront him with the evidence of fraud,” Ramos told me, “and then ask him about the dedazo”—“the big finger,” with which Mexican Presidents traditionally chose their successors. “In those days, and in the country where I grew up, no Mexican journalist could even speak that word, dedazo, in an interview with the President and still have a job when he got home.”","2246","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"One of Ramos’s models is Oriana Fallaci, the fiery Italian journalist. “I read her book ‘Interview with History’ in college,” he said. “I loved how she took on the Shah, Qaddafi, Kissinger. She saw the interview as a little war, with a winner. For certain interviews, I see it the same way. My only weapon is the question. And, living here, it’s not risky. I can make powerful people angry, and show our audience what they really are, and then go home and live a normal life.”","2247","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Home is in Coral Gables, where Ramos lives with his girlfriend, Chiquinquirá Delgado, a Venezuelan actress, who co-hosts a Univision reality show called “Nuestra Belleza Latina” (“Our Latin Beauty”). He has two children from two marriages, and his younger child, Nicolas, a high-school junior, still lives with him. Delgado’s five-year-old daughter rounds out the household.","2248","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"In the sushi place, our waiter, a tall young Venezuelan, told Ramos that he had decided to apply for U.S. citizenship. Ramos congratulated him. “I realized I have to do it,” the young man said. “If we can’t vote, then we have no way to fight back against people like Trump.”","2249","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos can’t get over the fact that the most trusted voices in mainstream TV news, as far as he’s concerned, are comedians: Jon Stewart, John Oliver, Stephen Colbert. Ramos and Oliver have joked together on-air about being immigrants, defeated by telephone voice-recognition systems that force them to adopt American accents to make themselves understood. Stewart accused Ramos of stealing his material when Ramos got big laughs on “The Daily Show” with lines about the Latino demographic boom. When Ramos urged Colbert, on “The Colbert Report,” to consider “co-responsibility” for undocumented immigration, since, as he said, “They’re here because we are hiring them, and we benefit from their work,” Colbert paused, seemed to go almost out of character, and finally said, “I don’t have a comeback for that, so we’re probably going to edit it out of the interview.” Ramos thinks that the best political comedians, with their fake news and stone-faced parody, are trusted because they offer, at bottom, “transparency” about their own views, rather than simply a straight news report that viewers have come to know is often riddled with false equivalencies in pursuit of “balance.” (“Others, however, insist the earth is flat.”)","2250","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos does not have a trust problem with his audience. Freddy Balsera, a media analyst and political consultant specializing in Latino affairs, told me, “We do polls. We ask, ‘Who is the most influential Hispanic in the U.S.?’ Over and over, Jorge comes out No. 1.” Sonia Sotomayor, the Supreme Court Justice, comes in first in other polls. Among institutions, Univision comes in second on the trust meter with Latinos, behind the Catholic Church.","2251","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"“People grew up with Jorge,” Gabriela Tristán, a Univision executive producer, told me. “You watched him with your parents, your grandparents. Him and María Elena. Whatever they say, it’s the law.”","2252","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Balsera thought that Ramos’s run-in with Donald Trump in Iowa had enhanced his standing among Latinos. “But why doesn’t Marco Rubio challenge Trump?” he said. “Or Ted Cruz? Why does Jorge Ramos have to defend our culture, our community?”","2253","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Some Latino conservatives disapproved of Ramos’s dustup. Ruben Navarrette, Jr., a syndicated columnist, accused him of being “unprofessional” and “playing into every negative stereotype that Americans subscribe to about Mexicans.” Then, there are the mainstream dismissals of Ramos as a lightweight, a niche performer, a “heckler.” Ramos appeared on “The O’Reilly Factor” shortly after the event in Iowa, and the segment began with Bill O’Reilly asking, “Anchorman or activist?” O’Reilly urged Ramos to stop calling himself a reporter. Ramos replied, “I don’t think you’re the right person to lecture me on advocacy and journalism.” He went on to draw a distinction between being partisan and being independent. O’Reilly is effectively a Republican Party partisan, he argued.","2254","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Alfonso Aguilar, who used to have a radio show on Univision, where he considered himself a “token conservative,” deplores the liberal bias of Univision, and thinks that “Spanish-language media is not being held to the same standards as mainstream media” when it comes to distinguishing between reporting and opinion. Ramos and María Elena Salinas are both at fault, according to Aguilar, “because you’re manipulating audiences if you don’t clarify.” Aguilar, who worked for the George W. Bush Administration and is now the executive director of the American Principles Project’s Latino Partnership, in Washington, D.C., still appears on Univision programs, including “Al Punto,” but he says that Univision correspondents in bureaus across the country complain to him, privately, that they get a bad rap because of editorializing by anchors in Miami.","2255","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos has had combative interviews with President Obama. During the 2008 campaign, he extracted a promise from Obama that an immigration-reform bill would be pushed forward during his first year in the White House. In a 2012 interview, Ramos, although appearing live on Univision, switched to English and said, “It was a promise, Mr. President. . . . I don’t want it to get lost in translation. . . . A promise is a promise. And, with all due respect, you didn’t keep that promise.” Obama looked miserable; Ramos hasn’t been markedly easier on him in more recent interviews. Last December, Ramos reminded the President that he had become known among Latinos as “the Deporter-in-Chief.” Yet Obama, along with every other national politician with an interest in reaching Latino voters, knows that Ramos and Salinas are the gateway. Randy Falco, the president and chief executive of Univision, is a Republican. He told me that, during the 2012 general election, he pleaded with Mitt Romney to appear on the network, and that Romney obliged him only once. That appearance did not go well, and Romney did not come back. But he later told Falco that staying away was a mistake: had he made more appearances on Univision, he might conceivably have improved his disastrous Election Day showing among Latinos.","2256","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos’s daughter, Paola, who recently earned a degree from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, has a job on the Hillary Clinton campaign. She previously worked in the Obama White House, and for Jill Biden. Ramos insists that his daughter’s employment does not influence his work. His Republican critics don’t buy it. He did not disclose her work for the Obama Administration to his audience. He did disclose her position with the Clinton campaign. He may have to recuse himself from any Univision-sponsored campaign debates that include Hillary Clinton.","2257","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Univision, though obscure to most non-Spanish speakers, plays in the big leagues. In 2013 and 2014, for what are known as the July prime-time sweeps, its audience was larger than that of each of the four main English-language networks. Its original programming is sold throughout the Spanish-speaking world. (The U.S. now has more Spanish speakers than Spain does.) Its local stations in New York and Los Angeles are consistently near the top of the ratings in those cities. On the news side, the network is far more cosmopolitan than its English-language counterparts, starting with its employees. Patsy Loris, the senior news director, is Chilean; Sabrina Zambrano-Orr, the executive producer of “Al Punto,” is Venezuelan; Teresa Rodriguez is Cuban; Isaac Lee, the president for news and digital, is Colombian; and so on. The coverage of international news, especially in Latin America, is decidedly more thorough and energetic than what the English-language broadcast networks provide.","2258","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Fusion, which launched in October, 2013, has hired away a number of executives and journalists from the networks in New York, including Keith Summa, a longtime producer at ABC News, who, more recently, headed the investigative unit at CBS News. In the Univision newsroom, Summa told me, “It’s not uncommon for me to ask, ‘Who’s that guy?,’ and then to be told, ‘Oh, he had to flee X country.’ These folks come from a culture where journalism is a contact sport. Here we worry that we’re going to get sued, not shot.” Describing the contrast with his old workplaces, Summa said, “People would come in to us at ABC with these minute-by-minute ratings, saying, ‘Oh, when the overweight person comes in, the dial goes down, and when the good-looking person is on it’s up.’ Is this really how we’re supposed to do journalism? Also, the left-right thing that dominates mainstream political reporting isn’t that relevant here. At Univision, it’s more north-south. I find that refreshing. And, of course, Jorge just calls it as he sees it. He says, ‘When you’ve got the facts, you don’t need to balance with non-facts.’ There’s a groupthink in the Bermuda Triangle of the three big networks, but Jorge doesn’t go to those cocktail parties.”","2259","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Isaac Lee, who is also the chief executive of Fusion, asked me if I knew who Ramos’s agent and lawyer were. I didn’t. “It’s him,” he said. “Jorge. We negotiate his contracts right at this table. It takes fifteen minutes.”","2260","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"When Fusion launched, Ramos was nervous about working in English. At first, he had a nightly news show, which began an hour after his Univision newscast ended. With his Sunday-morning show and his other gigs, the workload was unmanageable—he had so much script to write, and spent so many hours on set, that he could barely leave the studio to report stories. He soon cut back to the weekly show, “America with Jorge Ramos.” Fusion’s target audience was initially meant to be young, English-dominant Latinos, but such viewers didn’t want or need their own network, and the target demographic was expanded to Millennials (ages eighteen to thirty-four) of any ethnicity. The Fusion cable channel offers a mixture of news and entertainment, with heavy emphases on pop culture, the drug war, sex, and viral videos—and a small number of programs in heavy rotation. Fusion’s Web site, which launched in February, has a greater range and number of offerings, but will not soon be worrying competitors like Gawker and BuzzFeed. The digital content is available on many platforms—Instagram, Snapchat, Vine, Apple TV—and the company recently hired Alexis Madrigal away from The Atlantic’s Web site to be its editor-in-chief. Fusion TV is available in forty million homes, but is not carried by Comcast or Time Warner, and it does not subscribe to the Nielsen ratings service, which is probably for the best. The company lost thirty-five million dollars in 2014, its first full year in business.","2261","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"“America with Jorge Ramos” stands out from everything else on Fusion, partly because its host is decades older than anyone else at the network, but mainly because of its quality. Ramos has done specials from Israel and the West Bank (about young people and the wall there), and from Puerto Rico. He is always looking for new ways to address the immigration story. The style of his dispatches, and those of the young correspondents on “America,” is decidedly more handheld and helter-skelter, in the general vein of Vice News, than his work for Univision. In one stunt for Fusion, Ramos swam the Rio Grande, at a not-narrow point, fully clothed, gasping for air while trying to narrate. Still, the journalistic standard remains high, from what I’ve seen, and Ramos considers it a big step that clips of his work are immediately available, without translation, to the large number of Americans (and the media élites) who don’t speak Spanish. “It’s like we were just talking to ourselves before, to fellow-Latinos, in a parallel world,” he said. “This is a breakthrough.” With technical help from digital producers, he has thrown himself into social media, generating a steady stream of tweets and Facebook posts, including popular videos (millions of views) that he writes and shoots with a single camera in newsroom hallways when inspiration strikes.","2262","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"In May, Ann Coulter appeared on Ramos’s Fusion show. They taped the interview in front of a live audience, and Coulter’s eagerness to give offense was breathtaking. At one point, she said, “I have a little tip. If you don’t want to be killed by ISIS, don’t go to Syria. If you don’t want to be killed by a Mexican, there’s nothing I can tell you.” Ramos likes to say that silence is death on TV, but at that moment he said nothing. The audience, too, seemed shocked into silence. After a long, awkward pause, Coulter went on, “Very easy to avoid being killed by ISIS. Don’t fly to Syria.” Ramos finally asked, “Are you really saying . . . ? We’re talking about forty million immigrants in this country.” Coulter, arguing for an end to immigration, talked about how certain “cultures” from which large numbers of people immigrate to the U.S. “are obviously deficient,” making cryptic reference to “uncles raping their nieces.” It was, in its way, good TV.","2263","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos looks forward to the Latinization of the United States. “We were fifteen million when I got here,” he said. “Now we’re fifty-five million. By 2050, we’ll be more than a hundred million.” Converting those numbers to real political power is slow going. Univision and its smaller rival, Telemundo, along with many other organizations, sponsor voter-registration drives, but Latinos still punch well below their demographic weight in registration and voter turnout. Ramos is an evangelist for Latino political power. “Our turn is coming,” he told me. “And the attitude is changing, especially since Barack Obama was elected. I go out on publicity tours for my books, and, you know Latinos, they bring everybody in the family to everything, even little kids. So I always ask the kids, ‘Who wants to be the first Latino President?’ It used to be no hands went up, or maybe one or two. Now, with Obama, many of the little hands go up. It will happen in my lifetime. I hope to be able to cover the Inauguration. I don’t care if it’s a Republican or a Democrat. It could even be Rubio or Cruz.” Both have been on his show.","2264","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos, and Latino voters generally, appreciated the effort that George W. Bush made to reach them, particularly his support for immigration reform, even though it proved fruitless. Bush received forty per cent of the Latino vote in 2004. Ramos strongly endorses the conventional wisdom that no party can now win the White House with less than a third of the Latino vote. There is, however, a counterargument. California and Texas, the big states with the largest Latino populations, will not be in play in next year’s election, and most of the likely swing states have few Latino voters. The exceptions are Florida, Colorado, and Nevada, which have forty-four electoral votes combined. Florida, where Cubans and Puerto Ricans greatly outnumber Mexicans, is a special case, and not all electoral-vote strategists agree that Latinos will be a decisive factor in Colorado or Nevada.","2265","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Still, Ramos and his Univision colleagues find that national politicians are finally starting to come to them. Patsy Loris, who has been producing Ramos’s programs since the nineteen-eighties, told me, “It was always difficult. Every time we would ask for a sound bite in Spanish, we would get the assistant to the assistant to the assistant.” Ramos was sometimes able to get big interviews, but only in election years. “That’s changing now, thank God,” Loris said. “I think Jorge going on Fusion helps. But people who are just discovering him, they don’t realize, he’s always been exactly like this. He was never traditional. That was why he left Mexico.”","2266","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Loris’s office is along one wall of an enormous newsroom that Univision shares with Fusion and the local station, WLTV. Ramos was three doors down, banging out introductions for segments on “Al Punto,” which was taping that afternoon. María Elena Salinas was on the far side of Ramos. Along the other walls were control rooms, editing suites, and three TV studios; the rest of the open-plan floor was filled with desks where hundreds of people worked. Each desk had at least two large monitors, and nearly every chair was draped with a shawl, a sweater, a sweatshirt, or a coat—somehow, on a ninety-five-degree day, the vast space, two stories high and a hundred and fifty thousand square feet, was kept meat-locker cold. A dozen news channels were being projected on the walls.","2267","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"I camped out in Ramos’s office while he finished writing intros. There was no clutter. A little corkboard in the corner of his desk with tacked-up photographs of his kids and girlfriend. A vertical book stand in the opposite corner. A computer, before which he rolled his shoulders and clicked away. That was it. The only thing on the walls was a glass board on which a few dates and names were scribbled: “O’Reilly,” “Arpaio,” “Bill Maher,” “DC/Papa.” Those were upcoming gigs or stories. Ramos wears no jewelry, not even a watch or a ring—an uncommon presentation for a man in Miami. He keeps his hair short. He dresses simply, in jeans and an oxford shirt, tries to travel with only a carry-on bag, and hates wearing a suit—though he dons one every night for the newscast. He even somehow maintains an empty e-mail in-box. Salinas and I had been comparing overstuffed in-boxes. We both had thousands of unopened messages. Ramitos, as she calls him, had zero. Each time I e-mailed him, he answered quickly. It was unnatural.","2268","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Salinas said that, in twenty-seven years of working together, often under ferocious deadlines, she had never heard Ramos shout. “Things bother him, but he doesn’t yell and get mad,” she said. “I’ve never known anybody as disciplined as he is. Jorge can multitask like a woman. Very few men can do that. He’s flexible—he knows how to pick his battles—but he’s also incredibly stubborn.” She shook her head. “We know each other so well, we can read each other’s mind. On the air, we never interrupt each other. We know that if one of us is incapacitated—choking, forgetting something—the other will pick up.”","2269","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"TV news is live performance—part journalism and part theatre. The line between journalism and entertainment is blurred in other reporting genres, but TV is the closest to pure show business. In a cynical view, news is just another entertainment product among the many that Univision sells, and Jorge Ramos is a character, a “brand,” who brings profits to the corporation. Exposing corruption, confronting bigots, championing immigrants—these performances are hugely popular. “They help to protect an enormous market,” Tomás López-Pumarejo, a professor at Brooklyn College, points out. And the topic of immigration is a proven ratings winner on Univision.","2270","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"I have never heard Ramos say a cynical word. His zeal and outrage seem deeply felt, genuine. But I did notice, after the Trump press conference in Iowa, as Ramos was leaving the convention center, that he briefly crossed paths with Ann Coulter, who was preparing to introduce Trump at the rally. She seemed surprised to see Ramos, but unfazed. Not a word was said. They were two troupers, old pros, busy plowing their respective rows. They swerved toward each other and exchanged a quick fist bump in passing.","2271","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Later, I watched Ramos pacing on a levee above the Mississippi River in the twilight, talking on his cell phone, pondering his next move. Because of the Trump confrontation, he had already shot to the top of global “trending topics” on Twitter. He knew, as a newsman, that he shouldn’t step on the story. Interview requests were pouring in; he was turning down nearly all of them. He had already done a short, straightforward standup outside the convention center—in English for Fusion, in Spanish for Univision. He decided to talk the next morning, before dawn, Iowa time, to George Stephanopoulos, on “Good Morning America.” Since ABC is a co-owner of Fusion, a corporate obligation accrued there. Then, he thought, he would do Megyn Kelly’s show on Fox News. She, too, had been ill used by Trump. Other than that, he should probably let the story run on its own steam. Were these the calculations of a celebrity, a performer, or a journalist? Did those distinctions matter at that moment?","2272","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos finished writing his intros, sent them to a teleprompter file, did a phone interview with a Venezuelan radio station, and announced that he was ready to leave. We took his car to a Thai place in Doral for takeout. The Univision news studios are in a light-industrial park—a huge gray featureless box among long, pastel-façaded warehouses with uninformative names slapped over doors and truck bays: Avcom Technik, Nutritional Power Center, Trans-Air Systems, Inc. “That guy I was talking to in Venezuela, Nelson Bocaranda, is amazing,” Ramos said. “A great reporter. He always has sources. He even had a source among Chávez’s doctors.” That was a hard-news reporter talking. “But all the traditional media spaces are closed there now, so they’re using the Internet to do independent journalism. It’s incredibly courageous.”","2273","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The Thai place was in a strip mall. Ramos greeted people at nearly every table, all in Spanish. “Miami has been incredibly generous to Latinos,” he told me. “As one of my first bosses here told me, ‘It’s the only city in America where we’re not treated as second-class citizens.’ ”","2274","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Over lunch, I asked Ramos to name the most edifying story he has covered. “Probably the Mexican election in 2000,” he said. “I thought I was going to die with the PRI still in power.” The Institutional Revolutionary Party ruled Mexico for seventy-one years, ending in 2000. “On Election Day, we started playing soccer in the Zócalo, the Univision crew, as a way of celebrating. We were surrounded by soldiers and cops. This was precisely the regime I had been running from. All the efforts of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans had paid off.” Unfortunately, the Mexican governments since 2000 have proved a terrible disappointment. The PRI is back in power now, and Ramos has been hammering the leadership for its corruption and incompetence. Meanwhile, he says, Mexican journalists who have exposed corruption have been rewarded by being fired, if not far worse.","2275","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Back at the studio, we ran into Chiquinquirá Delgado. She was about to go on the air, and was wearing high heels that caused her to tower over Ramos. Delgado became a celebrity as a teen-ager, when she was first runner-up in the 1990 Miss Venezuela pageant; she went on to become a model and then a soap-opera star. I asked if her life in Venezuela had required bodyguards. It had, she said. Her life here was far more relaxed. She and Ramos rode bicycles, went to the supermarket. Then it was showtime; she smiled apologetically and hurried off. Seeing Delgado with Ramos on the set—probably the best-looking couple in Florida, if not North America—reignited my print hack’s distrust of TV stardom. Later, watching him on a Fusion set, waiting for the cameras to roll, I was struck by how physically different from the rest of us he seemed. The crew scurried around, lugging heavy equipment, muttering under headsets. We were all in shadow. The lights found Ramos’s calm, chiselled features, his clear gray eyes gazing into the middle distance. Then the technical director, a young African-American woman in a scruffy T-shirt and a backward ball cap, said, “O.K., we’re ready. Jorge, please sit down.”","2276","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"“For you, I will sit down,” he said.","2277","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The sheer quantity of multitasking—there is no other word for it—in Ramos’s workday is phenomenal. He is taping, writing, interviewing, making his arguments about the lineup and the order of the evening’s segments in the big three-o’clock news meeting, or going live, non-stop, back to back. That morning, he said, he had written a column about air-conditioning and climate change—the perversity of the status conferred by rendering buildings ice cold in hot places like Miami and Puerto Rico. The column, distributed by the New York Times Syndicate, would appear in more than thirty papers in the U.S. and Latin America. “But not till next week,” Ramos said, “when this Trump news cycle will have turned.”","2278","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"And now the Pope was coming to America. This Pope’s first language is Spanish. Might he score an interview?","2279","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Not a chance, Ramos said. He wished. But he had burned his bridges at the Vatican with a brutal 2013 interview of a powerful Mexican cardinal. “I was asking him about how the Church protected monsters like Marcial Maciel for so many years and we argued on-air.” Maciel was a Mexican priest who, among other depredations, sexually abused schoolboys in Italy and Spain, and was personally close to Pope John Paul II. I watched the interview, and the persistence of Ramos and the utter, teeth-gnashing rage of the cardinal were riveting. “I wasn’t able to confront those priests in school,” Ramos said. “But I can do it now.” He had definitely made himself a pariah at the Vatican, though, for years to come.","2280","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The lead story on that evening’s newscast was the resignation of Guatemala’s President, Otto Pérez Molina. Univision had a team on the ground, and they gave the event full, in-depth treatment. No other U.S. network would come close to the quality of this coverage. I watched Ramos and Salinas trade parts, sitting for some segments, standing in front of a wall lit with graphics for others. When they weren’t on the air, they clattered away on laptops, or studied monitors set beneath their desks, which showed what the competition was doing. There were moments of byplay between them. But off-camera, in repose, they were very different. Salinas, with her strong features and dramatic dark eyes, is leonine. She looks as if she could take down a wildebeest with a single bite. Ramos, beside her, seems almost meek, recessive. He folds his arms, cocks his head, and looks offstage, lost in thought, his motor barely idling. Then comes a director’s countdown, and he drops his arms, clasps his hands in front of him, leans forward, and seems to grow, addressing the camera, still relaxed but at the same time intense and commanding.","2281","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Another story for tonight: Donald Trump has just scolded Jeb Bush for speaking Spanish—to wit, “I like Jeb. He’s a nice man. But he should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States.” Salinas will report this item straight, near the end of the show, and Univision researchers have thrown together, on very short notice, a remarkable segment of Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, and Marco Rubio all speaking Spanish, some more fluently than others. Bill Clinton says, in English, “I hope I’ll be the last non-Spanish-speaking President.”","2282","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The Trump news cycle will not be over soon. He has encouraged the worst instincts in white America to emerge and flail and flex. In Alabama, one of his supporters told the Times that he hoped President Trump would “make the border a vacation spot. It’s going to cost you twenty-five dollars for a permit, and then you get fifty dollars for every confirmed kill.” When did it become acceptable in America to talk about other human beings that way at a mainstream political rally? The silver lining of this nightmare is that Latinos are now more likely to organize, politically, in fear and anger, and to make their power felt more strongly at the polls in 2016.","2283","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Toward the end of that evening’s newscast, I left the set and crossed the newsroom to a control room. I like the buzz of the dark, busy cockpit, all the producers and technicians intent on screens and consoles, the countdowns, the collective waves of emotion—nervousness and relief—as switches are thrown, segments successfully delivered, commercials correctly inserted. At Univision, the three official languages—Spanish, English, and Spanglish—fly around in quick, gaudy combinations. When a correspondent starts tripping over her words, a hush descends, and, when she finally makes it out of the sentence, there’s a general sigh. “Yeah, what she said.” But tonight, before I get to the door, I catch a segment up on a wall screen about that day’s ugliness. The story seems to be from North Carolina. There are posters, painted by children. The posters say “Go Home” and “America Is for Americans” and “If We Don’t Take Out the Trash, Who Will?” Nobody in the newsroom seems to be reacting to the story. Everybody has work to do. But I find myself too ashamed to open the control-room door. ♦","2284","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Thomas E. Watson, the populist from Georgia who had a long and increasingly demagogic career in American politics, wrote in 1910:","2285","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"The objects of Watson’s bile were the Italians, Poles, Jews, and other European immigrants then pouring into the United States. A century later, in the populist summer of 2015, some of their great-grandchildren have been cheering Donald Trump as he denounces the latest generation of immigrants, in remarkably similar terms.","2286","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"American populism has a complicated history, and Watson embodied its paradoxes. He ended his career, as a U.S. senator, whipping up white-Protestant enmity against blacks, Catholics, and Jews; but at the outset, as a leader of the People’s Party in the eighteen-nineties, he urged poor whites and blacks to join together and upend an economic order dominated by “the money power.” Watson wound up as Trump, but he started out closer to Bernie Sanders, and his hostility to the one per cent of the Gilded Age would do Sanders proud. Some of Watson’s early ideas—rural free delivery of mail, for example—eventually came to fruition.","2287","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"That’s the volatile nature of populism: it can ignite reform or reaction, idealism or scapegoating. It flourishes in periods like Watson’s, and like our own, when large numbers of citizens who see themselves as the backbone of America (“producers” then, “the middle class” now) feel that the game is rigged against them. They aren’t the wretched of the earth—Sanders attracts educated urbanites, Trump small-town businessmen. They’re people with a sense of violated ownership, holding a vision of an earlier, better America that has come under threat.","2288","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"Populism is a stance and a rhetoric more than an ideology or a set of positions. It speaks of a battle of good against evil, demanding simple answers to difficult problems. (Trump: “Trade? We’re gonna fix it. Health care? We’re gonna fix it.”) It’s suspicious of the normal bargaining and compromise that constitute democratic governance. (On the stump, Sanders seldom touts his bipartisan successes as chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.) Populism can have a conspiratorial and apocalyptic bent—the belief that the country, or at least its decent majority, is facing imminent ruin at the hands of a particular group of malefactors (Mexicans, billionaires, Jews, politicians).","2289","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"Above all, populism seeks and thrills to the authentic voice of the people. Followers of both Sanders and Trump prize their man’s willingness to articulate what ordinary people feel but politicians fear to say. “I might not agree with Bernie on everything, but I believe he has values, and he’s going to stick to those and he will not lie to us,” a supporter named Liam Dewey told ABC News. The fact that Sanders has a tendency to drone on like a speaker at the Socialist Scholars Conference circa 1986—one who happens to have an audience of twenty-seven thousand—only enhances his bona fides. He’s the improbable beneficiary of a deeply disenchanted public. As for Trump, his rhetoric is so crude and from-the-hip that his fans are continually reassured about its authenticity.","2290","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"Responding to the same political moment, the phenomena of Trump and Sanders bear a superficial resemblance. Both men have no history of party loyalty, which only enhances their street cred—their authority comes from a direct bond with their supporters, free of institutional interference. They both rail against foreign-trade deals, decry the unofficial jobless rate, and express disdain for the political class and the dirty money it raises to stay in office. Last week, Trump even denounced the carried-interest tax loophole for investment managers (a favorite target of the left). “These hedge-fund guys are getting away with murder,” he told CBS News. “These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.”","2291","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"But the difference between Sanders and Trump is large, and more fundamental than the difference between their personal styles or their places on the political spectrum. Sanders, who has spent most of his career as an outsider on the inside, believes ardently in politics. He views the political arena as a battle of opposing classes (even more than Elizabeth Warren, he really does seem to hate the rich), but believes that their conflicts can be managed through elections and legislation. What Sanders calls a political revolution is closer to a campaign of far-reaching but plausible reforms. He proposes a financial-transactions tax and the breakup of the biggest banks; he doesn’t demand the nationalization of banking. His views might appall Wall Street, but they exist within the realm of rational persuasion.","2292","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"Trump (whatever he really believes) is playing the game of anti-politics. From George Wallace to Ross Perot, anti-politics has been a constant in recent American history; candidates as diverse as Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama have won the Presidency by seeming to reject or rise above the unlovely business of politics and government. Trump takes it to a demagogic extreme. There’s no dirtier word in the lexicon of his stump speech than “politician.” He incites his audiences’ contempt for the very notion of solving problems through political means. China, the Islamic State, immigrants, unemployment, Wall Street: just let him handle it—he’ll build the wall, deport the eleven million, rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment, create the jobs, kill the terrorists. He offers no idea beyond himself, the leader who can reverse the country’s decline by sheer force of personality. Speaking in Mobile, Alabama, recently, he paused to wonder whether representative government was even necessary. After ticking off his leads in various polls, Trump asked the crowd of thirty thousand, “Why do we need an election? We don’t need an election.” When Trump narrows his eyes and juts out his lip, he’s a showman pretending to be a strongman.","2293","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-populists"
"There aren’t many examples of the populist strongman in American history (Huey Long comes to mind). Our attachment to democracy, if not to its institutions and professionals, has been too firm for that. There are more examples of populists who, while failing to win national election, extend the parameters of discourse and ultimately bring about important reforms (think of Robert M.

"Political parties are rarely suicidal in Presidential campaigns. While it’s not uncommon for a party to nominate an unelectable candidate in a Senate or House election, the Presidential nominating systems used by both Democrats and Republicans only occasionally produce a fringe candidate. The last time that the Republican Party truly misfired was in 1964, when it nominated Barry Goldwater, who lost forty-four states in the general election. On the Democratic side, the last time the party produced a fringe candidate was in 1972, when George McGovern, who took advantage of new nominating rules that he had helped to write, lost forty-nine states.","October 28, 2015","2295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"

"In August, Norm Ornstein, a longtime and well-regarded political observer, made the most comprehensive argument that Trump could prevail. Ornstein pointed to several factors: a conservative media that has fostered a deeper anti-establishment sentiment among G.O.P. voters, who are less likely to get news from outside an ideological bubble; a more extreme G.O.P. electorate, especially on the issue of immigration; the absence of a consensus establishment alternative to Trump; the emergence of Super PACs, which might encourage the traditional candidates to stay in the race longer and divide up the non-Trump vote; and the fact that Trump is “a far more savvy candidate” than Cain and the like.","2298","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"More recently, Alex Castellanos, who worked for Mitt Romney, echoed Ornstein’s arguments, and wrote, “Slow learner that I am, I’ve resisted the idea that Donald Trump could and would become the Republican nominee. Unhappily, I’ve changed my mind.” Steve Schmidt, a veteran of John McCain’s 2008 campaign, has repeatedly argued that Trump could win. Ron Fournier, the National Journal columnist, said in June that Trump “won’t win the G.O.P. nomination,” but this week he changed his mind and wrote, “I was wrong to rule out Trump winning the nomination or the presidency.”","2299","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"

"The overwhelming majority of Republican voters have repeatedly told pollsters this year that, whatever their choice in any given poll, they haven’t made up their minds yet. Most won’t think hard about their decision for at least another three months. At this point in 2008, Rudy Giuliani was the polling leader. In 2012, it was Cain. Rather than tell us anything deep about voter sentiments, polls at this point generally reflect name recognition and which candidates are receiving the most media attention at any given time.","2303","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"That’s why, despite Bush’s obvious troubles this year, it makes no sense for him to drop out of the race while he still has money in the bank and a very flush Super PAC financing an advertising blitz on his behalf. The most likely scenario remains that the G.O.P. will eventually coalesce around the most conservative candidate who is electable. Bush seems less and less likely to be that person, not because of Trump but because someone like Marco Rubio seems more conservative and more electable.","2304","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"While the G.O.P.’s rightward lurch is well-documented, the influence of the most conservative voters in Republican primaries is frequently overstated. Last year Henry Olsen, writing in the National Interest, dissected the Republican electorate and explained that it is divided into four groups: “moderate or liberal voters; somewhat conservative voters; very conservative, evangelical voters; and very conservative, secular voters.” His surprising argument was that, while most of the media coverage focusses on the latter two groups, which are louder and often more interesting to cover, it is the candidate who wins over the “somewhat conservative voters” who has the best shot at the nomination:","2305","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"While Trump often talks about the silent majority he is awakening, his actual supporters come from the G.O.P.’s noisy minority. The true silent majority in the Republican Party hasn’t picked its candidate yet. As Olsen makes clear, the G.O.P. Presidential electorate is little different from four years ago. Super PACs have not been able to save the candidacies of Rick Perry or Scott Walker, so the traditional process that winnows the field of unfunded candidates continues apace. It’s possible that the “somewhat conservative” kingmakers will end up backing Trump or Carson, but the safe money remains on Rubio, Bush, or even Kasich—one of those “even-keeled men with substantial governing experience.”","2306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-kingmakers-in-the-g-o-p"
"Republican candidates for President seem unable to shake the habit of making wildly reckless comments about science and public health. Michele Bachmann remains responsible for perhaps the most remarkable of these statements, when, in opposition to all known facts, she told Fox News, after a 2011 debate, about a girl who had “suffered mental retardation” as a result of receiving the HPV vaccine. Last week, though, Donald Trump solidified his place in the circle of scientific ignorance when he drew his own connection between vaccines and autism. “We’ve had so many instances, people that work for me,” he said, and described a “beautiful child” who, according to Trump, had recently been vaccinated, fallen ill, and “now is autistic.” Trump claimed that if vaccines were spread out, “I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.” Trump has repeatedly expressed his view that vaccines cause autism. In 2012, he tweeted that “massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism.”","September 22, 2015","2307","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"I have written many times that possible links between vaccinations and autism have been researched widely and have never been found to exist, and that words like Trump’s are dangerous—and even deadly. And I am far from alone. The comments came at a particularly bad time, because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had just begun its annual attempt to convince Americans to get flu vaccines, which, while not always perfectly effective, are safe and far better for both individual and public health than not getting vaccinated. (It has always been hard to know precisely how many people die of the flu in this country each year, but the number is in the thousands.) Federal officials say that this year’s vaccine is almost certainly going to be more effective than last year’s. But, thanks to our nationally televised lunacy, the job of convincing people to get them just got harder.","2308","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"Trump is terrifyingly popular, but we have come to expect dangerous inanities from him. Ben Carson, however, is another story. As a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon who retired after many years at Johns Hopkins, his sins against science during the debate were perhaps even more outrageous than Trump’s.","2309","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"Carson’s first comment on the subject made him sound like a responsible, educated physician: “There have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.” One cheer. Then things went south: “Vaccines are very important, certain ones—the ones that would prevent death or crippling,” he said. “There are others, a multitude of vaccines, which probably don’t fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases.” And: “A lot of this is … is … is pushed by big government.”","2310","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"What on earth was he talking about? Today, the C.D.C. advises that American children be vaccinated for fourteen diseases before age six—and each of those diseases can, in Carson’s infelicitous words, cause “death or crippling.” “The only one you could reasonably say does not kill is mumps,” Paul Offit, a physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told the Times last week. Offit, who is among the nation’s most outspoken vaccine advocates, added that mumps can, however, cause permanent deafness and sterility in men after puberty. “Tetanus kills, rubella kills unborn children, measles kills, hepatitis B virus kills,” Offit said.","2311","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"But Carson was just warming up, because what he said later was even worse: “It is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.” With that, Carson added his voice to the rallying cry of “too many too soon,” uttered reflexively by the anti-vaccine crowd. This notion, that the vaccine schedule for children has become so crowded that it puts extra pressure on their immune systems, is immensely popular among American parents—and, increasingly, pediatricians are yielding to their requests to delay vaccines.","2312","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"This, too, is dangerous. As Tara Haelle pointed out in a particularly useful post at Forbes.com, delaying vaccines just prolongs a child’s risk for preventable diseases. The data could not be clearer. And, despite the increase in scheduled vaccines, children are exposed to far fewer antigens than ever before. As many people (including me) have written, the smallpox vaccine—which we stopped administering after the disease was eradicated, in the nineteen-seventies—contained two hundred proteins. When counted all together, the fourteen vaccines that children receive today contain no more than a hundred and fifty.","2313","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"The only other trained medical professional on the stage also failed his biology (and public-service) tests last week. Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist, said, “I’m all for vaccines. But I’m also for freedom.” He seemed to care more about repeating that political conceit than about the lives of his constituents. He agreed with Carson that vaccines were “too bunched up.”","2314","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"It is sad to have to write this, when it should be clear by now, but here it is: vaccines are the most successful medical intervention in the history of humanity.

"There are not too many. They are not administered too soon. They do not cause autism or allergies or cancer. The only thing “too bunched up” about vaccines, as a matter of fact, are the falsehoods and deliberate misconceptions spread by demagogues and then endorsed by people like Carson and Paul, both of whom should—and almost certainly do—know better.","2316","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p"
"Ben Carson had wanted to be a doctor since he was a child in Detroit in the early nineteen-sixties, but he had the first inkling of what kind of doctor he might be when, as an undergraduate at Yale, he was introduced to Foosball. He played the game “with speed and ease,” he writes in his memoir, “Gifted Hands.” He had “an unusual ability—a divine gift, I believe—of extraordinary eye and hand coordination.” Even after he graduated and went on to medical school at the University of Michigan, a Yale student who made a great Foosball play was said to have scored a “Carson shot.” In the movie version of “Gifted Hands,” broadcast on TNT, in 2009, Cuba Gooding, Jr., as Carson, works the levers with a Jedi-like air—reprised in a later scene in which, during a twenty-two-hour procedure, Dr. Carson separates twin infants conjoined at the head. They were the first ever to survive such surgery.","2317","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson mentioned that operation in the first Republican Presidential debate, last month. “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins,” he said. “The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.” It was a Carson shot. Last week, a Monmouth University poll had him in second place among Republicans, with eighteen per cent, behind Donald Trump’s thirty per cent—meaning that the choice of nearly half the respondents was someone who has never held political office.","2318","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"There have been attempts to explain Carson’s rise as being simply of a piece with this disjointed election season. Sunny and unflappable, he has been seen as the refined Trump (Rich Lowry, of National Review, called him the “superior outsider”), or the Trump that not even Trump can hate (the Donald says that he’s “a wonderful guy”). The standard narrative is that Carson first appeared on the political scene in 2013, when, at the National Prayer Breakfast, he told his life story in a speech that, as the Fox News world heard it, was a rebuke to the President, who was sitting on the dais. In fact, Carson has been out telling that story for twenty-five years.","2319","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"His mother, Sonya, married his father when she was thirteen and he was twenty-eight. He turned out to be a bigamist and, once he was gone, Sonya supported Ben and his older brother by cleaning houses. When the boys struggled in school, she made them turn off the TV, read two library books a week, and write reports on them. She was functionally illiterate, but, as Carson said at the Prayer Breakfast, “we didn’t know that—she put check marks and highlights and stuff.” He went from the bottom of the class to near the top. His mother’s motto, which informs Carson’s conservatism, was: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” But Carson grew up a devout Seventh-Day Adventist, and “Gifted Hands,” like his campaign, is also about grace. When he was in ninth grade, after a friend teased him, he pulled out a knife and thrust it at the friend’s stomach. The boy could have died; Carson could have gone to jail. Instead, the blade hit his friend’s belt buckle and broke. Carson ran home, locked himself in the bathroom with the Book of Proverbs, and prayed to God to take away his temper. He says that he walked out a different person.","2320","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"In 1977, when Carson began his residency, at Johns Hopkins, he was sometimes assumed to be an orderly, but he regarded that as “a natural mistake”—what other black men did people see in hospitals? “I got a real kick out of watching them try to contain their expression of surprise,” he writes. He became an outstanding and innovative surgeon and, in 1984, at the age of thirty-three, the youngest head of a pediatric-neurosurgery department in the country. His joke about taking out half a brain was a reference to his pioneering work on hemispherectomies; the breakthrough case involved a four-year-old girl who had been racked by a hundred seizures a day.","2321","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"“Gifted Hands” was published by the Christian imprint Zondervan in 1990, after the surgery on the twins, and it has sold more than a million and a half copies. It is often assigned in schools, and a condensed version is being sold to fund Carson’s campaign. (According to the Times, as of July he had raised eighty per cent of his money from small donors, a higher proportion than any candidate except Bernie Sanders.) Carson has since written more books, started an educational nonprofit with his wife, Candy (they met at Yale, and have three sons), and gone on speaking tours. There is a parallel between his political emergence and that of Ronald Reagan, whose Prayer Breakfast moment was a televised speech in support of Barry Goldwater in 1964. The speech, titled “A Time for Choosing,” had been honed by Reagan during the decade he spent as a spokesman for General Electric, making appearances at company events in towns across the country.","2322","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Then, as now, the Republican Party was shifting in ways that were only peripherally visible to its ostensible leaders. Carson’s venues have been schools, churches, and gatherings of conservative activists, many of whom deeply distrust both their government and the larger institutions of their party. Their discontent, joined with what Carson sees as the lessons of his mother’s rejection of dependency, seems to have been a crucible for his own views. Eventually, he moved from offering himself as a role model to being a prescriber of policy.","2323","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Carson speaks to an unnerved America in terms that are themselves unnerving. He describes how our “pinnacle nation” is about to be driven down by moral decay. In his most recent book, “One Nation,” he writes that agents working against this country’s greatness include the political-correctness police, who use “faux hypersensitivity” to take power away from the majority of Americans. He regularly traces that strategy to Saul Alinsky, the mid-century community organizer whose name is a byword for conservative suspicions about Barack Obama. Political correctness, Carson says, is used to keep conservatives from invoking slavery or Nazism, both of which he cites freely. (“Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery”; “We live in a Gestapo age.”) He wonders if Obama will cause the elections to be cancelled: “He’s sitting there saying, ‘These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.’ ” Trump, the businessman, tells Americans how the financial system is rigged against them. Carson, the brain surgeon, tells them how they are being denied knowledge. It doesn’t seem to matter that he is a man of science who does not believe in evolution and has called climate change “irrelevant”: he is an ideologue with the trappings of a technocrat.","2324","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"
"Insofar as Carson has a political platform, it involves a low flat tax, modelled on the Biblical tithe; an end to Obamacare and to welfare for able-bodied adults; and the removal of restraints on our military in the Middle East. In lieu of specifics, Carson tends to say that as a surgeon he has experience “doing complex things” and making snap life-or-death decisions. His success in the polls may be best understood as desperation on the part of voters who have rejected political experience as a test of competence. But it should take more than a Carson shot to navigate this Presidential campaign, which has been played, so far, with all the reckless abandon of a Foosball game, and with little of the joy. ♦","2325","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/paging-dr-carson"

For instance, when President Jiang Zemin visited, in 1997, he was a reluctant supplicant. China was saddled with sanctions brought on by the crackdown in Tiananmen Square, and it craved investment—its economy then was smaller than Italy’s. Though Jiang was hounded by human-rights protesters, he took pains to charm his hosts, donning a three-cornered hat in Colonial Williamsburg and dancing the hula in Hawaii.","2326","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/dinner-talk"

China’s economy, by one measure, is now the world’s largest, and its military is a growing force in Asia. When Obama and Xi last met, in Beijing in November, they agreed to reduce carbon emissions and to improve military communication. In Washington, they are likely to expand on those agreements, and to send reassuring signals to investors, after a summer of stock-market turmoil. Still, tensions in the world’s most important diplomatic relationship are unmistakably climbing.","2327","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/dinner-talk"
"Xi arrives just as both countries are experiencing a wave of nationalism. Last month, after a drop in China’s stock markets and a devaluation of its currency triggered a plunge on Wall Street, Donald Trump, the Republican Presidential front-runner, called on President Obama to cancel Xi’s gala and “get him a McDonald’s hamburger.” Trump also demanded “a big uncoupling” of the two economies, and tariffs on Chinese imports of up to twelve per cent. “They want our people to starve,” he told Fox News. “They’re taking our business away.” Despite the fact that China is now America’s third-largest export market, other candidates followed suit. But the impact of the campaign rhetoric has been limited in China, where hardly anyone had previously heard of Trump, or Chuanpu, as he is known in Mandarin, and the Global Times, a state-run newspaper, reassured its readers that, during election seasons, American politicians frequently discover that criticizing China is “not only good for shock value but also safe for them; candidates can treat it as a useful tool with no consequences.”","2328","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/dinner-talk"

As the economic boom has slowed, the Party has promoted an alternative source of legitimacy, emphasizing the Communists’ triumph in ending a “century of humiliation,” suffered at the hands of Japan and Western imperial powers. Fearful that Western values will undermine its rule, the Party is considering a new law that would constrain nongovernment organizations—including even ones as apolitical as study-abroad programs. People’s Daily, the Party’s official mouthpiece, maintains an online page entitled “America’s Strategy to Contain China Will Never Change.” Since Xi took office, in 2012, government-run media outlets have escalated warnings about foreign “hostile forces” conspiring to destabilize Hong Kong.","2329","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/dinner-talk"

"At a grand military parade in Beijing this month, marking the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, President Xi announced a cut of three hundred thousand members of the armed forces—more than a tenth of the personnel—in an effort to consolidate and modernize the military. “War is the sword of Damocles that still hangs over mankind,” Xi said, before ushering a flotilla of tanks, drones, and other weapons down the Avenue of Eternal Peace. For the first time, China paraded its DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles, which American military analysts call “carrier killers,” because they could deny U.S. aircraft carriers access to the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Neither side is pursuing a military confrontation, but both perceive a growing risk of misadventure: China is building maritime bases in disputed parts of the South China Sea, and deploying ships and warplanes to police them. The U.S. Navy is adding ships to the region, and vessels and planes have had dangerous near-misses.","2331","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/dinner-talk"
"Among the preparations leading up to Xi’s visit, the thorniest subject has proved to be hacking—not cyber espionage, which many countries, including the United States, use to gather intelligence about other governments, but hacking of corporate secrets and intellectual property. For years, the Obama Administration and American businesses declined to discuss the breadth of attacks traced to China, in the hope of quietly solving the problem and preserving relations. But the business community has lost patience. In the past year, the F.B.I. has reported a fifty-three-per-cent rise in the number of Chinese cyber attacks aimed at commercial espionage. Earlier this month, the White House threatened to put sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals. Beijing immediately dispatched Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Politburo, for negotiations, and the idea was set aside. But, last Wednesday, in an unusually blunt statement, Obama said that cyber theft is an “act of aggression” that will be met with “countervailing actions” unless both sides can rapidly agree to rules of conduct.","2332","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/dinner-talk"
"Amid the anxieties, it is easy to overlook a powerful fact: trade between China and the U.S. has grown from $2 billion in 1979 to $592 billion last year, making the two nations more interdependent than ever before. Compared with the chaos of the Middle East and the frozen conflict in Ukraine, East Asia remains a relative oasis. According to a Pew survey, Americans under the age of thirty hold more favorable views of China than do older generations. When Henry Kissinger made his secret trip to Beijing, in 1971, with the aim of opening relations, the two countries were united, above all, by a common adversary. “But now we don’t have a common adversary,” Kissinger observed recently. In fact, we have a few: climate change, terrorism, nuclear proliferation. Progress on those would not require the world’s two most powerful countries to trust each other.

Carly Fiorina, Priebus said that the excitement her résumé is generating among the Republican faithful is totally understandable. “Like a lot of Republicans, I’d love to see Carly take on ISIS,” he said. “She’s shown she can destroy a large organization.”","2339","http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/party-that-mocked-presidents-lack-of-experience-favors-one-with-no-experience-whatsoever"
"One of the more amusing exchanges at Tuesday night’s Republican Presidential debate came after Donald Trump boasted about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I got to know him very well because we were both on ‘60 Minutes,’ ” Trump said. “We were stablemates, and we did very well that night.” A few minutes later, Carly Fiorina tried to one-up the New York billionaire. “I have met him”—Putin—“as well,” she said, “not in a green room before a show but in a private meeting.”","November 11, 2015","2340","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"Both candidates, it turns out, were exaggerating wildly. As Charlotte Alter writes, in a post for Time, “Trump was interviewed by CBS’s Scott Pelley in his New York City penthouse for the season premiere of the hour-long docu-series, while Charlie Rose travelled to Moscow to interview Vladimir Putin.” So not only did Trump and Putin not share a green room; they didn’t share a continent. As for Fiorina, my colleague Amy Davidson and the Huffington Post’s Amanda Terkel were among those to point out that, by the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O.’s own previous account, she did meet the Russian leader in something resembling a green room, in Beijing, where the two of them were giving speeches. “We were in sort of a green room setting, actually,” Fiorina said on “The Tonight Show,” in September. “The two of us were sitting sort of in a chair like this, about this close, for forty-five minutes before his speech and before mine.”","2341","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"So both Trump and Fiorina fibbed, or at least shaded the truth. Does it matter? In terms of how the debate unfolded, not much. Neither Trump nor Fiorina had a particularly strong night, but they weren’t called to account for these particular infractions. Even now that their statements have been exposed, the fallout will probably be minimal. Under the unstated but generally agreed-upon rules of reporting these events, neither statement rose to the level of an outrageous falsehood or a harrowing gaffe. In a two-hour political debate, you expect some misleading utterances and slipups. It’s only when a candidate says something indefensible—such as Gerald Ford remarking, in 1976, “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe”—or suffers a public brain malfunction—think Admiral James Stockdale, in 1992, or Governor Rick Perry, in 2011—that the consequences are severe.","2342","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"But that pattern raises the larger questions of whether what any of the current crop of candidates is saying counts, and how much this entire series of G.O.P. gabfests matters. Since August, we’ve had four of them, and neither of the best debaters in the race—Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz—is leading in the polls. Instead, two of the most mediocre performers—Donald Trump and Ben Carson—are still way out in front. We can discuss all day the basis for Trump and Carson’s support: celebrity appeal? A dislike of professional politicians? Animus toward illegal immigrants (Trump)? Evangelical Christianity (Carson)? Whatever it is, it isn’t their talent for the cut-and-thrust of live debate.","2343","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"Trump benefitted, in the first debate, on the Fox News Channel, from his novelty value, but since then he has delivered three unimpressive performances in a row. By now, we know his shtick. He makes a few general comments about making America great again, directs a few mocking comments toward Jeb Bush, retreats into silence whenever a detailed policy discussion gets going, and takes some additional shots at whichever of the other candidates has incurred his ire. (On Tuesday, it was Kasich and Fiorina.) Carson isn’t much more impressive; arguably, he isn’t any better at all. During the first three debates, he was so passive that it appeared he was barely deigning to take part. He showed a bit more energy in Milwaukee, especially when he attacked a media that has lately questioned some details of his life story. But, when the discussion turned to economics and foreign policy, he sometimes looked lost.","2344","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"Will these shortcomings hurt the two candidates in the coming weeks? It seems unlikely. According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, Trump has been leading handily for almost four months. Since early September, his only real competitor has been Carson, who recently moved into a tie with him. If this pattern is a blip, it is a very extended one. Back in May, before Trump made his candidacy official, I wrote a piece distinguishing the G.O.P. circus from the G.O.P. horse race. Right now, though, the circus is the horse race. To avoid this glaring truth, to concentrate on how the members of the supporting cast are doing relative to one another in live debates, is to present a pretty skewed version of what’s happening.","2345","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"In one sense, of course, the debates do matter. To the extent that people (particularly donors and bookers for television shows) base their thoughts and decisions on the post-debate commentary taking place in the media, a performance that reporters and pundits consider to be powerful can give a candidate a boost, and a performance that is perceived as weak can do damage. Particularly for candidates trailing in the polls, this is important.","2346","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"Following the second debate, Fiorina’s strong showing gave her a temporary lift; after the third debate, Rubio was the beneficiary. After his forceful display on Tuesday, Cruz may get a bit of a bounce. On the other side of the ledger, Scott Walker’s undistinguished appearances in the early debates helped to sink his campaign, while Bush took many knocks after his lacklustre showing in the CNBC debate. And John Kasich, one of the few candidates willing to depart from the standard Republican script on economic issues, did himself no favors on Tuesday night by repeatedly interrupting the other candidates.","2347","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"At this stage, however, these are second-order developments: Trump and Carson are the big story. Perhaps their supporters don’t care very much about the content of the debates. Perhaps they view what happens during the debates differently from the pundits, including Republican ones. On Wednesday, an Internet poll carried out for the Wall Street Journal indicated that Trump came out on top in Milwaukee: twenty-eight per cent of likely primary voters declared him the winner.","2348","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"In any case, the debates seem unlikely to determine who will win the early states. The next one doesn’t take place until December 15th, and, after that, there will only be one more before the Iowa caucus, which is scheduled for February 1st. Between now and then, something might bring down Trump and Carson: the Republican establishment will be praying that it does. But it won’t be the televised debates.","2349","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/do-the-g-o-p-debates-really-matter"
"Tuesday’s headline in the world of U.S. politics is that Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, has moved ahead of Donald Trump in a CBS News/New York Times poll of likely Republican-primary voters. The survey shows Carson with twenty-six per cent of the vote, and Trump with twenty-two per cent. The rest of the candidates are lagging far behind, in the single figures.","October 27, 2015","2350","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Since the start of October, half a dozen polls have shown Carson leading in Iowa, where evangelical Christians, who are flocking to his candidacy, make up about half of the Republican electorate. But the CBS/Times poll is the first major survey to indicate that Carson is ahead at the national level. Coming as it does the day before the third Republican debate, which will be held on Wednesday night in Boulder, Colorado, the numbers are sure to inspire headlines about whether Carson can win the nomination, and whether the long-predicted Trump slump is finally upon us.","2351","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Such speculation is probably premature. While the Democratic race appears to have settled into a predictable pattern—centrist favorite versus progressive underdog—the Republican race is still a freak show, to borrow a term popular with political operatives. Carson is now enjoying his moment, but more ups and downs can be expected, with other candidates rising and falling. As for Trump, strange as it would have sounded a couple of months ago, his presence at the top of the polls has become the one fixture in the race.","2352","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Arguably, the most important finding in the new poll isn’t the four-point gap that Carson has opened up over Trump—which, in any case, is within the survey’s margin of error. The key number is twenty-eight per cent. That’s the proportion of respondents who said that they had already made their minds up about which candidate to vote for: fewer than one in three. As a Times story about the poll put it, “Seven in 10 of those who expressed support for a candidate said it was too early to say for sure who they would support.”","2353","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"These figures aren’t too surprising. The Iowa caucus is still more than three months away, and the primary is proving to be quite a spectacle. If you were a potential G.O.P. voter, wouldn’t you sit back and enjoy the show for a while before deciding whom to vote for? Wouldn’t you be tempted to flirt with one or two of the candidates, especially the ones who seem new and different? It’s not as if we haven’t seen this sort of behavior before. In the last week of October, 2011, Herman Cain, the “9-9-9” man, was leading in the G.O.P. polls. A couple of weeks later, his campaign went into a free fall, and in December he dropped out of the race.","2354","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"I am not suggesting that Carson is another Cain, who was hit with allegations that he had made unwanted sexual advances toward women, and that he had been involved in at least one long-term extramarital affair. From what we know about Carson, his personal life and professional life are above reproach: that’s one reason why many Republicans are warming to him. (Another reason is that he has adopted ultra-conservative positions on abortion, gun control, and other social issues.) My point is simply that, at this stage in the campaign, the G.O.P. electorate is volatile, and much of Carson’s support is provisional. The CBS/Times poll explicitly confirms this. Four out of five of Carson’s supporters say that it’s too early to say for certain that they will vote for him.","2355","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"As for Trump, his impending demise has been announced many times before. This is just one poll. Another survey, released on Monday by the firm Morning Consult, showed him leading Carson by thirty-five per cent to twenty per cent. Since that poll was conducted over the Internet, it was probably less reliable than the CBS/Times survey, which was a telephone poll that relied on both landlines and cell phones. But the rule with polls is to look at the averages of multiple surveys, rather than at individual results. And, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average, Trump is still leading Carson by almost five percentage points—26.8 per cent to twenty-two per cent—nationwide.","2356","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"To be sure, Trump’s advantage has narrowed sharply since the end of August, when he was way ahead. But the fact is that he has been leading the race for more than three months. After a lacklustre performance at the second Republican debate, on September 16th, his numbers fell back. Since then, though—at least, prior to the CBS/Times poll—they appeared to have rebounded to the high twenties. This persistence suggests that Trump, in defiance of the general pattern of volatility, has established a base of support that amounts to somewhere between a fifth and a third of the Republican electorate. Unlike Carson’s supporters, a majority of Trump’s backers—fifty-five per cent of them, according to the CBS/Times poll—seem to have made up their minds about their choice.","2357","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"Of course, winning over a quarter of the primary electorate won’t be sufficient to carry Trump to the nomination. With up to half of potential Republican voters telling pollsters that they won’t back him under any circumstances, he faces serious obstacles to expanding his support. Still, unless something dramatic and unexpected happens, his presence in the race seems likely to remain its defining feature for at least a while. And that, in turn, means that the main task facing the other candidates is to navigate a way around him.","2358","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"
"So far, most of the traditional politicians in the field have struggled mightily to do this, especially Jeb Bush (whose troubles I considered a couple of days ago) and the now-departed Scott Walker. Carson, radiating calm and exploiting his status as a non-politician politician, has fared much better. Now, however, he will be in the spotlight, with higher expectations, more media attention, and more potshots coming at him from Trump and others. “It really is like a cleansing action,” Trump said Tuesday, on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “A lot of things will come out now, and we’ll see how he holds up to the scrutiny.” Beginning tomorrow night in Colorado, we certainly will.","2359","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/ben-carsons-moment"

"Mike Hauke opened a pizza and sub shop in Atlantic City in 2009, but only after he had failed in nine tries to rent the space to somebody else. He had bought the building three years earlier on the advice of his father, an accountant who considered distressed real estate a smart long-term bet. This piece of real estate seemed to test the proposition. It was a bedraggled three-story clapboard house that years of neighborhood demolition and neglect had stranded at the edge of several mostly vacant blocks, which together formed an urban badlands reaching all the way to the dunes. This was the South Inlet, a once thriving part of town and now more or less a desolate slum at the northeastern end of Absecon Island, the landmass that is home to Atlantic City and three other municipalities. People from “offshore,” as locals like to call the mainland, tend to think of the island’s Inlet end as north, because it’s upcoast, but locals call it east. Atlantic City has a Bermuda Triangle effect; it can confound a compass.","2378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Three blocks west of Hauke’s place, an immense slab of steel and glass was rising over the badlands: a hotel and casino to be called Revel, destined to be bigger and more opulent than anything Atlantic City had ever seen—two towers, reaching almost fifty stories, nearly four thousand rooms, and parking for more than seven thousand cars. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, had bought the land in 2006, for seventy million dollars, and sunk about $1.2 billion into the project. (Revel, as some have noted, is “lever” spelled backward.) By the end, the cost of building Revel reached more than $2.4 billion, making it the most expensive private construction project in the history of New Jersey.","2379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Hauke went after the crumbs. Unable to find a commercial tenant for his house’s ground floor (the apartments upstairs were designated Section 8, for low-income tenants), he started selling rudimentary takeout to Revel’s construction crews. Their rush-hour bulk orders overwhelmed his staff, but off hours the place was dead: a trickle of casino workers and, in Hauke’s words, “shitbags, crackheads, hustlers, and pimps.”","2380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Hauke, a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, had spent a couple of years in Hoboken and Manhattan working in marketing, but he had no restaurant experience. One of his first customers was a neighborhood junkie known as V8 Man (“All the white kids are junkies,” Hauke said. “The Inlet does it to everybody”), who, on opening night, picked a fight at the counter with a male prostitute and another customer; Hauke smashed a pizza paddle on the counter and used the sharp end to scare him off. More than once, a guy came in trying to unload stolen merchandise as the victimized storekeeper came running up the street in pursuit. One morning, a neighborhood kid rode by on a bicycle and threw a crude pipe bomb through the window; Hauke chased him in his car and, after cornering him briefly in an abandoned house, hounded him on foot across a vacant tract called Pauline’s Prairie, named after Pauline Hill, a city planner in the sixties who’d had this stretch of the neighborhood bulldozed for urban renewal, which never came. The kid, looking over his shoulder, ran into the side of a parked box truck. The police appeared and put him in cuffs. His grievance was that cops had been patronizing Hauke’s shop and that sheriffs had evicted his cousins, Hauke’s Section 8 tenants, from one of the apartments upstairs. The tenants, according to Hauke, had been running a welfare scam. They’d also been throwing dirty diapers on his customers and fishing for pigeons from the roof.","2381","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Hauke hoped that, in spite of such annoyances, Revel would either provide him with an income stream or else buy him out. A few neighborhood property owners said that it would never happen. They’d been holding on for years themselves, in the hope of selling to a big casino, and in the interim they’d been gutted by rising property taxes and ongoing decay. The problem was that the area was zoned for big casino-hotels. You couldn’t build a house, and the few houses left in the neighborhood—most had been demolished or had burned down, accidentally or not—were old and badly battered by the salt air. One of them, down near the beach, across the street from a run-down low-income housing complex called the Waterside, belonged to a teacher Hauke had got to know named Tony Zarych, who’d moved to Atlantic City as a teen-ager forty years earlier, when his family was buying up property around town. He’d worked as a baccarat dealer at the Sands, until it closed (it was demolished in 2007), and now taught English as a second language at an elementary school. He liked to hunt wild turkey offshore and sometimes had carcasses hanging outside. His property taxes had risen sharply, as the city contended with a steep drop in tax revenues from the casinos. “Get out while you can,” Zarych told Hauke.","2382","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Sure enough, in 2009, amid the financial meltdown, Revel, only half built, ran out of money. In April, 2010, Morgan Stanley quit the project, booking a loss of almost a billion dollars. Construction stopped. Hauke’s business withered. “There were no more tourists or construction workers,” he recalled. “Mostly just cops. And crackheads wanting free shit.” But something about the city, and about the Inlet’s seaside squalor, made him want to stay on. Maybe it was the fact that his great-grandmother had attended shul in the Inlet. Or that he’d simply got sand in his shoes, as the locals say about those who take to the place.","2383","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"After grinding along for another year, Hauke shut down the shop, spiffed it up, and rechristened it Tony Boloney’s. He bought a food truck, which he named the Mustache Mobile, and developed a line of pizzas and novelty subs that he marketed as “indigenous Atlantic City grub,” as though he’d revived an obscure provincial cuisine. Soon, Tony Boloney’s began winning foodie awards and luring in not just gamblers, night-clubbers, food-truck connoisseurs, politicians, and cops but also a procession of casino magnates and real-estate speculators who were visiting the neighborhood, often on the sly, to size up the distressed property next door.","2384","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"At the beginning of 2011, Governor Chris Christie pledged tax incentives to Revel worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars. (The incentives were tied to certain revenue targets, which, in the end, Revel failed to meet.) Christie had evidently decided that Revel’s success was essential to the survival of Atlantic City, and therefore his gubernatorial track record. His pledge helped Revel secure new financing from an array of hedge funds, including Chatham Asset Management and Canyon Capital, which manage hundreds of millions of dollars in New Jersey state pension funds.","2385","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Construction resumed, and Christie came to town. After a photo op at a famous sub shop called the White House and a visit to the Revel site, he dropped in at Tony Boloney’s and urged Hauke to keep the place going. “Listen, you gotta stick around,” Christie told him. The Revel executives were emphatic as well: “It’ll look bad if you close. Please don’t go anywhere.” The head of Chatham Asset Management hired Hauke to cater his annual Halloween party, up in Essex County.","2386","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Revel opened in the spring of 2012, with Beyoncé performing a series of concerts in its auditorium. (She also took over the Presidential Suite, relegating Michelle Obama and her daughters to another suite.) The plan had been scaled back—just fourteen hundred rooms, and one tower instead of two. The tower’s midsection had a half-dozen stories not yet built out; you could see clear through it. Still, it was an impressive building, with sleek, airy marbled atriums and lobbies that had little in common with the smoky, windowless, carpeted caverns of the older mega-casinos down the boardwalk. Unlike all the rest, it directed one’s attention to the ocean and had ample outdoor space, a two-acre terrace with firepits and cabanas. Even from the outside, Revel had an ethereal appeal. The reflective glass took on the sky’s hue and became almost invisible at dusk, a stealth casino guarding the edge of town.","2387","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"If only. During construction, a tower crane collapsed. Lightning struck a worker’s cement bucket and killed him. Three top Revel executives died in a plane crash. A guest plunged from one of several escalators that climbed vertiginously through the heart of the lobby. A couple were found dead of an apparent drug overdose in a suite.

"The casino wasn’t making nearly as much money as the developers had anticipated. Some observers blamed the layout—the hotel-room elevators didn’t access the casino floor, and a long, tortuous trip from the entrance to the check-in desk didn’t take you through it, either—or the fact that Revel prohibited smoking, or that its slot machines didn’t seem to pay out, or that it was stingy with the comps. Even though occupancy was decent and the night clubs and restaurants were busy, the tables and slots weren’t taking in enough to offset the cost of operating the place—the burden of debt service, high property taxes, bad leases with the tenants, and an expensive arrangement for power and light. Within a year of opening, Revel filed for bankruptcy. It restructured and emerged from Chapter 11 a few months later, but the economics still didn’t make sense, and so, in the spring of 2014, it went bankrupt once again. Finally, last September, unable to find a buyer, it closed.","2389","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"From the time Morgan Stanley began searching in vain for equity partners, Revel had been in play, and all along Tony Boloney’s had served as an informal commissary for would-be investors and buyers. Among those whom Hauke and his staff said they’d seen were Steve Wynn, who had sold the Golden Nugget in 1987 and vowed never to come back; various hedge-funders from New York; and a group of Chinese men—the Export-Import Bank of China was at one point in talks to buy a piece—who took over Hauke’s tables and held meetings for hours, without ordering anything.","2390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"A mysterious character in tattered clothing and a handlebar mustache had been showing up a few times a year, engaging the staff in conversation about space travel and Elon Musk. He claimed to represent someone who was going to buy Revel. Hauke and his team were skeptical, but one day last summer, just before the casino closed, the man rolled up in a baby-blue Bentley convertible. Maybe he was for real. “My guy’s going to offer ninety million,” he said. His guy, he went on, was from Florida and intended to erect a “Tower of Geniuses” on the Revel site, a high-rise think tank, which would draw on NASA and the federal government’s aviation-research facility at Atlantic City Airport, just offshore.","2391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"If not for zany schemes, Atlantic City would still be a sand dune. Within weeks, news broke that a little-known Florida developer named Glenn Straub, the owner of Palm Beach Polo Golf and Country Club, had offered ninety million dollars to buy Revel. Straub wanted to put up the aborted second tower and fill it with academics and scientists charged with solving the world’s problems: your Tower of Geniuses. Few in town took this seriously, but, as far as the bankruptcy was concerned, he’d established a baseline. Everything has a clearing price. The bad news was that Straub’s offer was less than four cents on the dollar—a chilling signal of how far Atlantic City had fallen and may yet fall. The good news was that the building—and you might even say the town—was worth anything at all.","2392","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Most cities exist as a consequence of commercial or strategic utility. Atlantic City is more of a proposition and a ploy. The town fathers of Cape May, the first American seaside resort, weren’t interested in a railway, or perhaps the class of people who’d ride in on one—the well-to-do arrived from Philadelphia by boat—so a group of investors built, in 1854, what became known as a “railroad to nowhere,” to a spot a little way up the coast that was more or less the shortest possible distance from Philadelphia to the sea. Over the decades, and with the industrial-era advent of leisure time and disposable income, this forsaken wedge of salt marsh and sand became “the world’s playground”—a crucible of conspicuous consumption and a stage for the aspirations and masquerades of visitors and entrepreneurs. In some respects, Atlantic City was where America learned how to turn idle entertainment into big business. For a while, it was home to some of the world’s grandest hotels (the Marlborough-Blenheim was the largest reinforced-concrete building in the world, and was later imploded in the music video for Bruce Springsteen’s “Atlantic City”), as well as some of its more ardent iniquities and diversions. The night clubs were as often as not fronts for backroom gambling halls, intermittently tolerated by the authorities.","2393","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The city, like so many, has its racial demons. At the turn of the twentieth century, Atlantic City had one of the highest African-American populations of any city north of the Mason-Dixon Line, owing to the abundance of jobs in the hotels. The archetypal amusement was that of white working-class visitors kicking back in the boardwalk’s famous wicker rolling chairs while black people did the pushing—a “public performance of racial dominance,” notes the historian Bryant Simon, in “Boardwalk of Dreams.” Though the Northside, traditionally a black neighborhood, had been a thriving district, the decline in tourism to the city, after the Second World War, hit it hard. With the rise of affordable air travel, people started going to Florida and the Caribbean instead. The city desegregated. Disneyland opened.","2394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Legalized gambling was supposed to rescue the city from its obsolescence as a resort and convention town, a condition that came to national attention during the 1964 Democratic Convention there and grew more conspicuous as the decade wore on. A dozen years later, the state passed the Casino Control Act, which was, at least ostensibly, an attempt to reverse the decline. But, perhaps predictably, a lot of the money that flowed in flowed right back out—to the casino operators and their financing schemes (“I made a lot of money in Atlantic City,” Donald Trump said at the recent Republican debate. “And I’m very proud of it”) and to their subsequent efforts to lobby for the approval of casino gambling in other states. New Jersey, which taxes the casinos to fund a seniors’ prescription-drug program, among other things, always got its piece.","2395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Neglect of the city has been attributed to a bloated municipal payroll—a budget nearly double what it was ten years ago—and the years of corruption and mismanagement in city government. Some blame the suffocating effect of the casinos, which are boxed off from the city and are designed to keep patrons inside losing money rather than outside spending it. Others point to the thorny old problem of race or the dreary question of the structure of municipal government statewide.","2396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The dividing line between south and north, and between white and black, used to be Atlantic Avenue, the main commercial street, which runs parallel to the sea. It was where South Jersey shopped for wedding dresses and jewelry; now it’s a gantlet of shabby storefronts and fast-food joints, running toward and away from the New Jersey Transit bus terminal. In the streets that run from the boardwalk, dilapidation and squalor are not hard to find. Wood’s Loan Office, a pawnshop established in 1927, is owned and operated by Martin Wood, a seventy-nine-year-old Atlantic City native. Wood, who is white (his grandfather, a metallurgist, came to town from Lithuania at the end of the nineteenth century and used to scavenge for junk on the beach with a horse-drawn wagon), has noticed an uptick in the number of shopping bags from the outlet mall, a few blocks away. In his opinion, the sixties were worse. “It’s not that bad here. Yet.” Twenty years ago, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority moved the pawnshop a few blocks, in an effort to remedy the city’s oft-lamented lack of a supermarket. “But they opened a discount liquor store next door to the new supermarket,” Wood said. “That was not a good move. They wound up with winos hanging around. People were scared to go to the supermarket. So it closed up.”","2397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"“Atlantic City turned its back on the boardwalk,” Paul Steelman, a prominent casino architect who grew up nearby, said. “It’s the most prominent pedestrian walkway in the world.

"In order to prevent monopolies, the Casino Control Act stipulated that no one could own more than three casinos. In the eighties, Donald Trump became the first to hit that limit. Eventually, the provision was scrapped, and by 2014 Caesars owned four.

"Does Atlantic City need more gambling, or less? There are proponents on both sides. Some favor alternative entertainments (concerts, water parks, polo, legalized marijuana) or the panacean potential of higher education (Stockton University, a state college headquartered offshore, has long wanted an Atlantic City campus). A few push for smaller boutique casinos, and others swear by the existing big-box regimen, just done better. In Las Vegas the ratio of revenue is two-thirds non-gaming to one-third gaming. In Atlantic City the situation is reversed. Since 2006, gaming revenue has dropped by half, from a peak of $5.2 billion to $2.7 billion. As that stream dries up, logic suggests tapping others. And yet the casinos remain lucrative. Divided among eight casinos—that’s how many are left—$2.7 billion isn’t bad. This may be the locals’ most commonly stated reassurance. The city has a higher concentration of casinos than anywhere outside Nevada. It gets twenty-five million visitors a year.","2400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

"Two weeks after the shuttering of Revel, Trump Plaza closed—the fourth casino to do so in 2014. The first was the Atlantic Club, né the Golden Nugget, built in 1980 by Steve Wynn, with financing by Michael Milken and one of the earliest iterations of the junk bond, and then owned (and rechristened), in succession, by Bally’s, Hilton, and Resorts International. Two competitors, Tropicana (owned by Icahn) and Caesars (controlled by the private-equity firms Apollo Management and TPG Capital), bought out the bankrupt Atlantic Club, closed it, and divvied up the scraps. Next came the Showboat. It was profitable, but its owner, Caesars, hobbled by debt, needed to consolidate. (The amputation failed: in January, Caesars declared bankruptcy; another of its holdings, the Bally’s casino, has been rumored to be the next to go.) Meanwhile, Trump Entertainment Resorts declared bankruptcy (its fourth), and Icahn, who’d bought up Trump’s debt, played a game of chicken with the casino workers’ union and the state. (Donald Trump himself no longer runs the company or the casinos, and he has sued to have his name removed.) In December, the Trump Taj Mahal was about to close; Icahn, having squeezed the state and the union for concessions on taxes and benefits, found twenty million dollars to keep it open, and since then it has limped along, a zombie casbah.","2403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"It’s not all the big shots’ fault. There’s just been less money to go around. Atlantic City has lost its monopoly on legalized gambling on the East Coast. First came the casinos on Indian reservations in Connecticut, in the nineties, and then, in recent years, the advance of gaming across state lines, in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and upstate New York. (Some industry experts will tell you that Manhattan is destined to have tables, too.)

"Neighboring states approved legalized gambling in the hope that it would do for their economies and state treasuries what it once did for New Jersey’s. Perhaps they should hope instead that it does not. The casino closures in Atlantic City have contributed to the loss of nearly ten thousand jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and who knows how many associated income streams, reputable or not. The city has fewer than forty thousand permanent residents; the majority of Atlantic City’s workers live offshore, in the townships of Atlantic County, which, in the first quarter of this year, led the nation in foreclosures. Property taxes in the city have doubled since 2008 and were up twenty-nine per cent in 2014, to make up for the drop in tax revenue from the casinos and in the taxable value of the property. The city is around four hundred million dollars in debt. Earlier this year, its credit rating was downgraded to junk-bond status.","2405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"After convening a few summits on the predicament in Atlantic City, which resulted in a dire report, Governor Christie, in January, appointed two emergency managers, Kevin Lavin and Kevyn Orr, to oversee the city’s finances, wresting control from the mayor and the city council. The fact that Orr had previously served as Detroit’s emergency manager, steering Detroit into and out of bankruptcy, led observers to predict that he’d been hired to do the same for Atlantic City. Perhaps mercifully, the mayor, Don Guardian, was relieved of some of the hardest decisions, about who and how many to fire and what services to deprive the citizens of. “A good manager welcomes a good auditor,” he told me. The mess was now Christie’s. Presiding over the first bankruptcy for a New Jersey municipality since the Great Depression would not help his Presidential ambitions, and, perhaps more important, it would raise the already high costs of borrowing across a state whose finances are very grim. Christie staked a lot on his rescue of Atlantic City, and so far the bet’s not looking so good.","2406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

"Abandonment, and the spectre of bankruptcy, intensified the bleakness of the winter in Atlantic City. At one end of the boardwalk, Revel loomed dark. At night, the blare of piped-in pop warped in the wind, and floodlight spilled out over the dunes, which, post-Sandy, were just a layer of sand atop an armature of giant sandbags. The obituarists who came to gawk didn’t have to bother going so far. On the façade of the first casino that one saw after pulling off the expressway there was the ghost lettering of the immense sign that once spelled out “Trump Plaza” and, beneath it, a billboard that read “The Center of It All.” (The small print read “Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-Gambler”—advice, maybe, for the city itself.)

She’d come to town three years before, when a friend got her a role in a dinner-theatre company down shore, in Ocean City, and then she found herself auditioning at Harrah’s, which, in those days, used cocktail waitresses as dancers in its TV commercials. “The choreography was difficult,” she recalled.","2409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

It was glamorous,” Inglin said. “Then the attention and the business was diverted from the Plaza to the Taj. Things started closing. Restaurants, room service. For four or five years, there were constant rumors that this or that person was going to buy us. I don’t have enough fingers and toes to count the number of people who were going to save us. The last few years were so stressful. You watched people lose their jobs.

Enoch (Nucky) Johnson, his successor and the basis for the Steve Buscemi character in “Boardwalk Empire,” continued this work and presided over Atlantic City’s glory years, during Prohibition, which, largely thanks to his efforts, never really pertained. The third was Hap Farley, a Republican legislator and master puller of wires, whose political swan song was his support, behind the scenes, for the second (and successful) attempt, in 1976, to pass the state bill to legalize gambling in Atlantic City.","2417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

In city politics, the Democrats held sway. (The electorate is now thirty per cent Hispanic and forty per cent black; Democrats outnumber Republicans nine to one.) The only Republican elected to* City Hall in the casino era was James Usry, the city’s first black mayor, who got caught up in a corruption investigation that cost him the 1990 election—until 2013, when, to the great surprise of the city’s political establishment, Don Guardian, a gay white Republican, beat Lorenzo (Rennie) Langford, an African-American, by fewer than four hundred votes.","2418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

Here and there were garish furnishings salvaged from the casinos: headboards from Trump Plaza, smokestacks and banquettes from the Showboat, chandeliers from the Sands.

"It was hard to find a building or enterprise in the city limits that was not in some way touched by crisis and folly. But none was more conspicuous, and of greater likely consequence to the city in the long run, than Revel. Last September, with Glenn Straub’s ninety-million-dollar offer as the stalking horse, the bankruptcy court held an auction to sell it. The winner, at a hundred and ten million dollars, was Brookfield Property Partners, based in Toronto. Brookfield owned the Atlantis in Nassau and the Hard Rock in Las Vegas, and so saw some synergy here, but it couldn’t make a deal with the owners of Revel’s adjacent power plant, which had been built solely for Revel and was charging Revel three million dollars a month for utilities. (The power plant was a separate, independently owned entity, called ACR Energy Partners—an arrangement that has proved poisonous.) In November, Brookfield decided to forfeit its deposit, of eleven million dollars, and walk away. The only bid left, apparently, was the one predicated on a Tower of Geniuses.","2429","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub began unfurling his plans. He said he’d spend three hundred million dollars building the second tower and another half billion to buy up derelict property around town. He’d refurbish Bader Field, the defunct downtown airport, and establish an equestrian center for two thousand horses, polo fields, high-speed ferries to Manhattan, a life-extension university, and the world’s biggest indoor water park.","2430","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Whenever I called Straub, he answered his own phone and seemed not to have assistants or gatekeepers, or any kind of filter at all. The first time he picked up, at his club, he told me, through bites of an apple, that he had just finished playing a polo match, that he lived and worked on a yacht, that he was debt-free, and that he had two brilliant adult daughters with whom he had failed to spend enough time. Once, he answered his phone as he was getting fingerprinted by the Casino Control Commission, for his gambling-license application. Another time, he announced that he was at a urinal. With bankruptcy-court procedures in mind, I asked, “So what comes next?” and he replied, “I wash my hands.”","2431","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub invited me to meet him at Revel one day in February, on one of his trips to town. He tended to fly up on Spirit Airways, to save money. When I arrived, he was still busy trying to buy Bader Field. (The city, the Mayor had told me, wanted far more for it than Straub was willing to pay.) Straub also talked of buying the racetrack, Trump Plaza, the Showboat, and several large tracts of undeveloped land in various parts of the city. At times, he talked as though he’d bought some of these things already.","2432","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In the all but abandoned Revel corporate offices, overlooking a slatey winter sea, two of the remaining Revel employees were waiting for Straub to arrive. They didn’t work for him yet, but, given that he was the putative buyer, they allowed him to use the space and they were inclined to be deferential.","2433","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

He’s trim, at sixty-eight, and he had the bent gait of an aging country-club athlete. In a kitchenette, he made a sandwich for himself and sat down in a conference room with a view down the boardwalk: in the foreground, the empty lot that would one day, he hoped, be home to his water park, and then, stretching south, the casino cordillera—Showboat, Taj, Resorts, Bally’s, Caesars, Trump, Trop.","2436","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"“It’ll be done the right way,” Straub said. “I’ll actually wash the windows here. It’ll cost a couple of dollars. There must be ten million windows in this frigging place. That’s the first thing we’ll do. Get the laser light shows and wash the windows and hire four thousand employees. That way, I’ll get the politicians. ‘Oh, Straub, I know him. I want to do business with one of his marinas,’ or whatever. . . . Get their attention. ‘Guys, I got a high-speed ferry. . . . Midtown Manhattan, what do you got there for a pier?’ Politicians can get you into that place that you can’t get into.”","2437","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub’s way of talking in a stream-of-consciousness rush, in the manner of an Appalachian Don King, often made his big plans seem scattershot and his tactical explanations disjointed, at least to someone not adept in vulture finance. “He has a learning disability,” his daughter Kim, a branding consultant in New York, told me. “When he was a kid, when it was time to read aloud in class, he’d count the people who were supposed to read before him and then, just before his turn, go to the rest room. He’s a bit of a savant.”","2438","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub comes from Wheeling, West Virginia, where his father had a business providing transportation to the Texas Eastern pipeline and later owned auto-leasing franchises and taxi fleets. “So you worked, and if you didn’t work Dad got the belt out and beat your butt,” Straub said. “Anyway, he died, just when I got my driver’s license.” After high school, Straub and a brother helped run the businesses. In time, they owned a network of sand and gravel quarries and concrete and asphalt plants; highway- and airport-construction contracts made them rich. (In recent years, those long-moribund quarries, in the upper Ohio River Valley, have been found to sit atop vast reserves of oil and gas, extractable by horizontal drill, making Straub even richer.)","2439","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub retired at forty, moving his family (his wife, from whom he divorced in 2007, and two daughters) to Florida. “I lasted six months,” he said. He started investing in distressed and bankrupt properties. It was a good time to have cash on hand. In the wake of the savings-and-loan crisis, at a Resolution Trust Corporation auction, he bought a twenty-two-hundred-acre golf and polo club in Wellington, for $27.1 million. It was called Palm Beach Polo. “All of a sudden, people were giving me a half a million dollars for an acre,” he said. “I sold two or three hundred million dollars’ worth, and we still have another thousand acres down there.” A big driver was the equestrian center: “Never once thought it would turn out to be a gold mine, but it did turn out to be a gold mine, because then the Bloombergs of the world and their daughters, and all the movie stars’ daughters, they would go down there, and they would have the big Olympic stars do the show jumping, and there was this thing called polo. I didn’t know what a polo game looked like. They put you on a horse. And I thought, This isn’t that hard. I was good in sports, amateur sports. I can hit things. I can pick a fly out of the air.”","2440","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub has been called “the dictator of Palm Beach polo.” His reign has been contentious. In numerous lawsuits, he has been accused of neglecting his residents, as well as the grounds, and charging undue fees. In 2010, he was tried, and ultimately acquitted, on criminal charges of polluting protected wetlands. He was once convicted of contempt, after interfering with a federal marshal who’d come to seize a yacht at a marina Straub owned. He tried to appeal the verdict all the way to the Supreme Court, without success. Through the years, he has been proudly litigious. “If you check me out, I’m pretty good at protecting our rights in the court system,” Straub told me.","2441","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In the conference room, he told me about his idea for an ocean liner. “An old ocean liner, like the QE2. I’m gonna buy it,” he said. He squeezed mayonnaise from a packet. “Bring this ocean liner in, and I don’t know if you’ve been around Ripley’s down in Orlando, the whole building shaking and everything else. I’m gonna teach my kids, or my kids’ kids, what World War II was all about, and the Holocaust, and Zeros coming in from Japan, and so when you go inside this thing, this ship, it’s gonna make you feel like you’re being bombed, like Pearl Harbor when the damned Zeros came in, took out our whole fleet in the Pacific. The ship’s suites where the crew used to be will be for my construction workers, because if we’re gonna spend this kind of money up here I need to get cheap housing for them, so instead of shipping them back to Philadelphia and bringing them here every day I’ll let them store themselves in the bottom of the ship. It’ll be like the back lots at M-G-M.”","2442","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Throughout the winter, Straub made regular trips to Atlantic City and to the federal bankruptcy court in Camden, where he pressed his attempt to have his bid approved. Amid innumerable motions, hearings, and rulings, attorneys representing bank lenders, unsecured creditors, jilted tenants, other prospective buyers, the power company, and the gutted estate argued for and against his offer, sometimes changing sides as the circumstances evolved. Other bidders waded in and wandered off. The power company remained a sticking point. The lawyers racked up their fees and did their pressers on the courthouse steps.","2443","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"One cold morning in February, Straub arrived at the courthouse in a gray suit, with a trenchcoat slung over his shoulders. He said he’d left his cell phone in a bathroom at the airport, and someone had retrieved it and was sending it back. He looked at the pairs of lawyers filing in through the door. “A few more guys and we’ll get a soccer game going here,” he said. “I wish I was getting paid a thousand bucks an hour.” Straub’s lawyer, Stuart Moskovitz, of Freehold, not normally a bankruptcy attorney, called them the “bankruptcy cabal.” It was essentially the deadline on Straub’s bid, now at ninety-five million dollars, but he had failed to close, owing to some unresolved questions about his obligation to old leaseholders and to the power plant.","2444","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

"Problem was there didn’t seem to be one. With this in mind, Straub and Moskovitz had been threatening to put in a much lower bid if their offer fell through. At one point, Straub stood and handed his lawyer a piece of paper. Moskovitz read aloud, “Sometimes the judge has to protect the debtor from himself.”","2447","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In the back of the courtroom, a lanky man in a yellow sweater, his graying hair perfectly in place and his eyes darting around, fidgeted with his fingers as though he were handling invisible chopsticks. His name was Vincent Crandon. He was a low-profile Jersey dealmaker from Mahwah, and he had been circling various properties in Atlantic City for years, to no avail. He’d failed in attempts to buy Trump Plaza and the Atlantic Club. Early on, he’d been after a bricks-and-mortar property to go with an Internet-gaming company. But his quest had morphed into something else, and so now he just lurked, waiting for the court, or perhaps the entropy of Atlantic City, to scuttle Straub’s bid. Quietly casting himself as the new white knight, he’d submitted an offer, but so far it had gone unacknowledged.","2448","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"“Straub is done,” Crandon told me later. “We’ve put in a better offer. We’re sitting back, taking our time.” He added, “Straub thinks he’s the only guy in town.”","2449","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The town, and the sellers, seemed to think so, too. After the ninety-five-million-dollar offer fell apart, Straub put in a lower bid, for eighty-two million, and lawyers for Revel and the lenders, increasingly desperate, supported it in court. At the beginning of April, the presiding judge, Gloria Burns, who said she would not let the case delay her impending retirement, abruptly ruled in favor of Straub. The questions of the tenants and power plant remained unresolved. For a few days, anyway, the town experienced something like hope.","2450","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Atlantic City, formerly a breeding ground for big ideas, was now a tar pit—trapping financial mastodons and big-eyed dreamers, whether or not their intentions were pure, as the capricious gods of commerce looked on. Revel kept luring in new ones. In April, the day after Straub took ownership of Revel, he called Crandon and—according to Crandon, anyway; Straub denies it—offered to flip the property to him for a hundred million dollars. A couple of days later, Crandon drove down to Atlantic City. With Revel blacked out (owing to the inevitable dispute between Straub and ACR, the power company), the only people allowed inside were security officers from the Casino Control Commission. They stood in darkness guarding acres of idled slot machines, which Straub wasn’t technically authorized to own, since he had no gaming license. So, according to Crandon, the two men who would decide Revel’s fate met in one of its parking garages. Crandon had along one of his partners, Don Marrandino, an Atlantic City native known as Rockin’ Don, for his music-industry connections. He had been the president of Hard Rock in Las Vegas and of Caesars East Coast operations. Straub was accompanied by Tara Lordi, his adviser and “toxic-asset manager,” a horsewoman and former banker. Crandon says Straub told them he wanted much more than a hundred million for Revel, but at least he now had a possible out, and Crandon had an in. (Straub says the meeting never happened.)","2451","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Crandon had been eying Revel for a year. Crandon, who is fifty-three, grew up in Delaware, but his parents were from New Jersey, and as a kid he worked at a service station his grandfather owned on the Black Horse Pike. His surname used to be Ceccola; Crandon is an adaptation of Cranendonk. His father-in-law is Theodor Cranendonk, a wealthy Dutch oil trader who was once imprisoned in Italy on charges of delivering thirty bazookas to the Mafia. (“It was all made up,” Crandon says. According to Crandon, Dutch commandoes sprung Cranendonk from a prison hospital and brought him back to the Netherlands.) One of Crandon’s investment vehicles is called MidOil, but Cranendonk was not involved in the Revel bid. “He doesn’t do gambling,” Crandon said.","2452","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Crandon said his group—“We’re Jersey guys”—planned to spend hundreds of millions reconfiguring the space. The new name would be Rebel. Crandon said they were planning a forty-night Bon Jovi residency. Rockin’ Don had the pull.","2453","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"The money wasn’t from Jersey guys. Crandon says he spent a marathon weekend in town and in New York wooing representatives from a Chinese real-estate firm that had been buying up properties around the United States. Crandon’s group and the Chinese were betting that Macau, the Asian gambling mecca, was tapped out, amid a Chinese government crackdown on corruption and gambling, and that travellers from mainland China would soon be including South Jersey on their U.S. itineraries. The Atlantic City airport would be the hub for jumbo-jet charters from Asia. The margins are better if you can lure a plane from Hong Kong than a bus from Port Authority. Atlantic City, born in proximity to the population and early industrial wealth of Philadelphia, would now reach halfway around the world for money and the guests from whom to separate it.","2454","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Crandon believed that Straub was planning to demolish Revel. A consultant had told him you could net a hundred million dollars if you sold it off as spare parts. There was a precedent: In 2004, Straub bought Miami Arena for twenty-eight million dollars, half what the city had paid to build it. He promised to turn it into a venue for horse shows, conventions, and minor-league sports, to help revive downtown Miami. “Tearing it down serves nobody’s purpose,” Straub said at the time. Four years later, he tore it down.","2455","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Events on the ground in Atlantic City seemed to be pushing Straub in that direction. As soon as he bought Revel, he found himself, not unexpectedly, in a war with ACR, the power plant, and thus, in short order, with the city. The maneuverings often seemed frivolous and petty, except that a city was at stake. Straub refused to pay ACR the three million a month for power, and ACR refused to provide it for free. And so Revel remained dark: no light, heat, air, or water, no sprinklers or alarms. The city’s fire marshal deemed the building unsafe, and the city rescinded Straub’s certificate of occupancy and began fining him five thousand dollars a day. Observers wondered about catastrophic fire and debilitating mold.","2456","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Straub dug in. He told reporters, as he unsuccessfully challenged the plant’s owners in court, “We’ll erase them off the map.” He brought in a fleet of diesel generators and parked them outside the casino. But he had no permits, and ACR owned much of the connecting infrastructure. Back to court they went. Straub, the loser again, sent the generators away. He told me, referring to city and state officials, “If they won’t work with me, I’ll just go back to Miami.” Publicly, he made the threat explicit: “I’ll tear the building down.”","2457","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"To circumvent ACR, Straub had set about trying to buy the empty casino next door, the Showboat, and tap into its power plant instead. The Showboat’s owner, at the moment, was Stockton University, the state college, which, a few months earlier, had bought it to establish a long-desired Atlantic City campus. The university had paid just ten dollars a square foot. “You can’t even buy tile at Home Depot for ten dollars a square foot!” Herman Saatkamp, Stockton’s president, told me.","2458","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"But the campus plan had suddenly fallen apart, when Trump Entertainment, owners of the Taj Mahal, next door, unexpectedly opted to enforce an old covenant mandating that the Showboat be a casino-hotel, and nothing else. Icahn, who controls Trump, didn’t want a college campus next door. “Who is this guy?” Bob McDevitt, the president of Local 54, the casino workers’ union, said of Icahn, with whom he has been feuding for a year. “How does he get to decide everything? He’s disembowelling the city.”","2459","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Icahn blames the unions. “I saved the Tropicana, which was bankrupt, and made it into one of the only vibrant and surviving casinos in Atlantic City,” he told me. “I have also saved the Taj Mahal and have saved six thousand jobs. Bob McDevitt has caused three casinos to close and the loss of thousands of jobs. Ask yourself: Who is the villain of this story?” Capital or labor? Germany or Greece? Depends on whom you talk to. In July, Taj workers, having lost many of their benefits, voted to authorize a strike.","2460","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"At any rate, now Stockton was stuck with a vacated casino on its balance sheet and monthly maintenance costs of four hundred thousand dollars. That’ll buy you a lot of tile. And so Saatkamp, the university’s president, who is also a leading scholar of George Santayana (“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”), rushed into a provisional agreement to flip the Showboat to Straub. At the end of April, Saatkamp, out of his depth in these sharky waters, resigned as Stockton’s president, his tenure scuttled by the Showboat and Revel mess. Santayana: “Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and it is shameful to surrender it too soon.”","2461","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"Throughout the spring, Crandon pressed for a deal while Straub held out for more. Straub told me, “Everyone says, ‘Oh, you’re so fucking smart, Mr. Straub.’ And I’m saying, ‘I’m not smart. I can just outlast everybody.’ ” Tara Lordi e-mailed Crandon one afternoon in early April:","2462","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"In early May, according to Crandon, the two men met aboard Straub’s yacht, the Triumphant Lady, which he’d brought north to Atlantic City and docked at the Golden Nugget. Crandon says they actually shook on a deal, for a hundred and thirty-two million dollars. (Straub denies this meeting took place and in general was dismissive when I asked him about Crandon, referring to him as “Kramden.”)","2463","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"But they continued to haggle over terms and timing as Crandon worked out his arrangement with the Chinese. There were stories of Straub stiffing a local law firm, and of his filling a truck with Revel fixtures and tools, bound for Florida. (He denies wrongdoing in both cases.) His deal to buy the Showboat foundered, and a court gave Stockton the go-ahead to seek another buyer. As weeks passed, Crandon made promises that he’d soon hold the keys to Revel, and then the deal would recede again: Zeno’s paradox down the shore.","2464","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"At the end of June, Crandon texted me to say that his deal with Straub was off. “Greed and evil have destroyed A.C.” He explained, “What happened is we got circumvented.” Straub, apparently, had cut him out of the loop and gone directly to the Chinese. He had come to see the potential of junkets from overseas. Crandon sent photos of Tara Lordi in Shanghai with a Chinese man, whom he still, vestigially, called “my partner”: “2 days after that photo, Chinese canceled our deal.” Crandon vowed revenge: “We will keep it in litigation for years. No one will get Revel.”","2465","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"
"If Straub was really planning to sell to the Chinese, he wasn’t saying. Lordi says she went to Shanghai to play polo. Straub said he was looking for groups to help manage the hotel and the casino. All the while, Revel remained closed. Still no light shows or clean windows, to say nothing of the four thousand new jobs the city so desperately needed. Revel’s remaining employees were let go. There was no one left, really, except for the security guards overlooking the slots, in the sweltering heat of an un-air-conditioned glass box in high summer.","2466","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-death-and-life-of-atlantic-city"

"“Our goal tonight is to have a true debate,” CNN’s Jake Tapper said at the opening of Wednesday night’s entertainment. “A debate doubleheader” is what CNN called it, but the preferred sports analogy was to boxing. Last month’s feisty Fox News debate having been dubbed Round One—“If you think Round One was intense, you haven’t seen anything yet!”—an onscreen clock counted down the seconds to Round Two. The idea was to put the candidates in a ring two at a time, show them in split-screen, and poke them with sticks. “Tell Donald Trump why he’s wrong,” Tapper begged the candidates. They obliged with sucker punches and dodges but no knockouts. Like every other televised Presidential debate, except more so, Round Two was more of a long, disjointed, train wreck of a group interview than anything resembling an actual debate. Three reporters (but mainly Tapper) spent nearly five hours asking questions of fifteen candidates, in two sessions. They got canned answers, piety, and jibber-jabber. As debate, it was terrible; as television—“Hollywood Squares” meets “The Bachelor”—it was unlookawayable, at least for the first eight or ten minutes or so and then, really, you could look away, especially if you had something super important to do, like loading the dishwasher.","September 17, 2015","2469","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"

Last night’s eleven-at-once is the largest number of Presidential aspirants on a debate stage, but not by much. In 2003, nine Democratic candidates appeared in front of CNN cameras, at the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix. That night, Carol Moseley Braun said Americans should elect her because “the men have ruined it, our country is a mess, it’s time to give a woman a chance,” while Howard Dean said the one thing he knew, from the polls, was that “there are five of us up here who are going to beat George W.

If a candidate mentioned another candidate, even if only in passing, that other candidate was given an opportunity to reply and encouraged to take a swipe. CNN must have thought this would make great television, and help draw an audience as big as the unprecedented number of viewers who tuned in for last month’s Fox News debate. The hitch here, though, is that televised Presidential debates are all or nearly all that many citizens see of the American political process. Is this how the nation’s political leaders want to model disagreement and deliberation in a democracy? By kicking each other in the shins? A lot of high-school kids were required to watch the CNN debate, and, in class, they’ll hold their own debates, applying the lesson this debate taught them, which is that appearance is everything and squabbling is everything else.","2473","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"“Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer,” Carly Fiorina said, when Tapper asked her if she wanted Trump’s finger on the “nuclear button.” Somehow this led to Trump arguing that “Rand Paul shouldn’t even be on this stage” and that Pataki, who in fact wasn’t on the stage, “couldn’t be elected dogcatcher.”","2474","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"Fiorina appeared poised and commanding, and Marco Rubio appeared eloquent and erudite. (“We should have a deeper debate about these issues,” Rubio said, and he meant it.) Ted Cruz reached for learnedness and never achieved it: as always, he looked nuts. Ben Carson had the best suit, and the gentlest and most appealing laugh, though he had very little to say. I forgot Scott Walker was there. Jeb Bush was nervous. He took a jab at Trump, claiming that when Trump wanted to open casinos in Florida, he’d tried to buy politicians with campaign donations. After Trump denied this, Carson piped in that he wouldn’t “lick the boots of billionaires,” which was memorable, but not in a good way.","2475","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"“If I were sitting at home watching this back and forth, I’d be inclined to turn it off,” John Kasich said, as things got fiery, fairly early in the debate, thereby revealing that, while he is a sane man among madmen, he has no real knowledge of American television.","2476","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"There was much discussion of the Iran deal, ISIS, and the Middle East. Rubio and Paul were sober. “This world is a mess,” Trump said, summing up his foreign policy. He blamed President Obama: “Somehow, he just doesn’t have courage.” Mike Huckabee declared, “This is about the survival of Western civilization.” The domestic version of Huckabee’s impassioned rhetoric was Fiorina on the need to defund to Planned Parenthood: “This is about the character of our nation.” Chris Christie blamed Hillary Clinton: “She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb.” This produced another spat between Trump and Bush. “You said you were going to cut funding for women’s health issues, you said it,” Trump said. “I heard you.” And, presumably because the subject was, vaguely, women, this led to Tapper raising the matter of Trump having said, in comments to Rolling Stone, that no one can stand to look at Fiorina’s face and later insisting that, by “face,” he meant “persona.” Shoved into the ring with Trump, Fiorina said, “I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.” Here Trump did a kind of curtsy: “I think she’s got a beautiful face, and I think she’s a beautiful woman.” And when the topic turned to immigration, and descended very quickly into the question of whether Bush ought to speak Spanish in public, and why Trump had insulted Bush’s Mexican-born wife, Trump refused to apologize and curtseyed again: “I’ve heard she’s a lovely woman.”","2477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"It went on for a while after that. (“Can you believe @CNN is ‘milking’ it for almost 3 hours?” Trump had tweeted earlier in the day.) Near the end, Tapper cited former Reagan Secretary of State George Shultz, who has called for a more active government response to climate change, whereupon Christie called the notion that people can help fix the problem a “wild, left-wing idea.” Ben Carson turned a question about whether vaccines cause autism into an indictment of big government. In a round robin, Tapper asked the candidates which woman they’d put on the U.S. ten-dollar bill. Presumably, he meant American women, but Bush named Margaret Thatcher and Kasich came up with Mother Teresa. There was mention of Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, and Abigail Adams. Rubio made a compelling case for Rosa Parks. But three of the candidates apparently couldn’t think of any American woman worth honoring, and instead—more curtseying—suggested their own relatives, Carson his mother, Huckabee his wife, and Trump his daughter.","2478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"

"On Friday, October 2nd, Jeb Bush was onstage at a college auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, for a public interview with Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general and a prominent figure in the right-wing firmament. Bush is sixty-two, but, thanks to a low-carb Paleo diet, he looks younger than he did when he left the Florida governor’s office eight years ago for a life in the business world. A trim physique, however, hasn’t boosted his appeal to potential voters. A new national poll showed that Bush’s support had sunk to four per cent; South Carolina, which has one of the most conservative Republican electorates in the country, and will hold its primary early next year, just after Iowa and New Hampshire, is crucial to winning the nomination. Once considered the front-runner, Bush is trailing a clutch of candidates, among them Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who have never held public office and encourage comparison to buffoons.","2480","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb has presented himself as the most electable Republican candidate: willing to break with Republican orthodoxy on domestic issues such as immigration and education, and committed to breaking, if vaguely, with his brother’s legacy on foreign policy and to being, as he has said, his “own man.” Before Bush officially entered the 2016 campaign, he remarked to a group of C.E.O.s at a conference in Washington, D.C., that a successful candidate had to be willing to “lose the primary to win the general,” and should campaign “without violating your principles.” He meant that one must avoid the perennial trap of party primaries, in which “base voters,” the hard-core conservatives, force politicians to take extreme positions that will prove unpopular in a general election and, when later disavowed, expose the candidate as a phony. “It’s not an easy task, to be honest with you,” he noted. (Hillary Clinton faces a similar problem in her race for the Democratic nomination.)","2481","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But in his conversation with Wilson, and in a subsequent interview with me and other reporters, Bush veered toward the right. On domestic affairs, his view was neatly summarized by his answer to a question about gun control. It was the day after the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, and yet Bush rejected any calls for new legislation. He noted that he had confronted similar pressure for government action after tragedies while he was governor: “Look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”","2482","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush was pilloried by Democrats for his “stuff happens” remark, but he defended it, telling me that the government doesn’t have a solution to every problem, and that sometimes government action makes matters worse. Some variety of a laissez-faire philosophy is standard for modern Republicans, at least on most domestic issues. But, increasingly in recent months, Bush, like a number of his colleagues, has been making the case for aggressive intervention abroad. Two days earlier, Russia had carried out its first air strikes in Syria. When I asked Bush how he would respond if he were President, he said that it was the lack of American action that had created the dire situation in Iraq and Syria, and invited the Russian military to bolster the Assad regime.","2483","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I think we need to stand up to Putin, not just as it relates to Syria,” Bush told me. “This sends a signal all around the world of the United States pulling back, not being serious. Our allies don’t believe that we’re going to have their back. And this emboldens our enemies.” Bush offered no details on how to “stand up to Putin” or what, exactly, he would do to pacify the killing floor of the Middle East and South Asia and reconcile the tangled rivalries and interests there. But his message to the base was clear: We must do something. And we must do it now.","2484","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush’s view represents a return to a simplistic interventionism that seemed discredited in the wake of the Iraq debacle. For decades, the G.O.P. has been split into two camps. The realists, who dominated the Presidency of Bush’s father, George H. W. Bush, emphasized diplomacy and coalitions over go-it-alone displays of force, and a skepticism about America’s ability to shape the internal dynamics of foreign countries. They also expressed a willingness to tolerate tyrannical regimes that advance U.S. interests or create greater stability in volatile regions of the world. The other camp—variously described as idealists, hawks, and neoconservatives—dominated the Presidency of Bush’s brother. They have more often called for the overthrow rather than the containment of hostile regimes, and they remain committed to exporting American-style democracy to places where it has never flourished.","2485","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The hyper-interventionist foreign policy of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney was widely blamed for the Republican Party’s loss of Congress in 2006 and of the Presidency in 2008. But many hawks, once more in full voice, now believe that the Obama years—the emergence of ISIS, the crisis in Syria and Iraq, Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, the rise of Putin at a time of Russian isolation and economic weakness—have vindicated Bush. “Any Presidential candidate, the first thing he or she needs to do is put up a map of the Middle East in 2009 and one today,” John McCain, a leading hawk in the Senate, told me, as we discussed foreign policy in his office. “And point out that it is this President’s failures. He said he got out of conflicts. He got out of conflicts, but the conflicts didn’t end.”","2486","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama thinks that intractable foreign-policy crises should be guided by the physician’s maxim of “first, do no harm”—or, as his aides have said privately, “Don’t do stupid shit.” To Republican hawks, this sounds like a willful and dangerous abdication of American power and influence. Lindsey Graham, who is one of the long-shot Presidential candidates and McCain’s closest ally in the Senate, has called for ten thousand American troops to be sent back to Iraq. Last week, Chris Christie said that he would set up a no-fly zone in the Syrian airspace in which the Russians are now operating, and shoot down any planes that entered it.","2487","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But of all the Republican candidates vying to reform the world of foreign affairs only one belongs to a family of Presidents that, for better or worse, did so much to give that world its present shape. When Jeb Bush began his campaign, he enlisted as advisers some of the realists from his father’s camp, including the former Secretary of State James Baker. But the heaviest contingent consisted of his brother’s liege men: Paul Wolfowitz, the Defense Department official who made the ideological case for invading Iraq; John Hannah, who had been an adviser to Dick Cheney and pushed bad intelligence into Colin Powell’s famous speech at the U.N. making the case for war; Porter Goss, the former C.I.A. director who condoned waterboarding as an interrogation technique; and Stephen Hadley, the former national-security adviser, who took the blame for false assertions that President Bush made about nuclear yellowcake allegedly sought by Saddam Hussein from Niger.","2488","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Another adviser on his team is Otto Reich, who served in various foreign-policy roles in the Reagan Administration and in both Bush Administrations, and is perhaps best known for his participation in the 2002 attempted coup against Hugo Chávez, the late socialist leader of Venezuela. (Reich denies that he or the U.S. played any role in the coup.) In May, Jeb Bush, after providing a series of confusing responses on the issue, said that, given what is now known about the condition of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear-, biological-, and chemical-weapons program in 2003, he would not have invaded Iraq. Not all of his advisers share this sentiment.","2489","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I can defend the invasion of Iraq,” Reich told me. “What did the invasion of Iraq do? It caused all of the people who would’ve otherwise come and attacked us and killed Americans on our soil—it caused them to go to Iraq and die there. That may sound very brutal, or whatever, but we have seen what has happened when you have an Administration like the current one, that did not realize what Bush had done; sent the troops home from Iraq; created a vacuum that was filled by ISIS. And they’re killing Americans and everyone else—they’re mostly killing Muslims. I lay that at the feet of the Obama Administration.”","2490","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He added, “All Republicans say what I just did . . . but it’s not reported. Nobody listens. It goes against conventional wisdom. Conventional wisdom is that Bush was a failure in foreign policy, because of Iraq. Well, history is beginning to tell a different story.”","2491","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The American public’s appetite for military interventions runs in cycles. After the triumph of the Second World War, policymakers were emboldened to roll back Communism, but the miasma of Vietnam instilled a wariness of major overseas military entanglements that spanned the Carter and Reagan Presidencies. In 1991, the relatively quick and successful Gulf War sparked a new bipartisan consensus that American force could again be deployed wisely if it was undertaken with overwhelming strength and with the benefit of an international coalition. The lack of intervention in Rwanda was widely seen as a moral calamity for which politicians, including Bill Clinton, have apologized.","2492","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"That uneasy consensus lasted through the 2001 toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the invasion of Iraq in 2003 came to be seen as such a catastrophic mistake that even its progenitor could not avoid casting blame on his own circle. George W. Bush, during his last two years in office, forced out Donald Rumsfeld and marginalized Dick Cheney. It was too late to save his own popularity. When voters went to the polls in November, 2008, Bush’s job-approval rating dipped to twenty per cent, the lowest of any outgoing President in the history of polling.","2493","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Voices of restraint can still be heard in the Party’s debates, including on Jeb Bush’s team. One adviser, in contrast to Reich, told me, “I’m sure he’s not going to invade Iraq again. We did that one. You can’t compare him to his brother, because his brother was operating in a different environment. We had just been attacked; we didn’t know what was coming next.”","2494","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

They’re trying to find out where the public is, and trying to take the public’s pulse.

"Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, who is also running for President, told me that he thinks he’s found it: a foreign policy that channels Reagan, by far the most popular Republican in modern history.

"Cruz is forty-four, eighteen years younger than Jeb Bush. Other politicians of his generation, including Marco Rubio, also forty-four, were strongly influenced by 9/11, but Cruz told me that he draws more lessons from Reagan’s fight against Communism than from Bush’s and Obama’s fight against terrorism. “The foreign-policy events that shaped my world view the most did not occur in the past two Presidencies,” he said. “I believe in peace through strength. It’s worth underscoring. Reagan went through eight years in the Presidency, and the biggest country he ever invaded was Grenada.”","2497","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He emphasized that “among Republicans there is a spectrum of views of foreign policy. At one end, there is Rand Paul”—a non-interventionist who is the most skeptical of further involvement in Syria and Iraq. “At the other end, I would put John McCain. Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio are very similar to McCain. I would describe my views as a third point on the triangle.” He believes that “America should always be a clarion voice of liberty, and that the bully pulpit of the Presidency has enormous power. There is power to speaking the truth on a global stage.” He added, “However, speaking for freedom is not the same thing as using U.S. military force. Historically, America has always been reluctant to engage in military force.”","2498","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Reagan’s foreign policy was rhetorically idealistic but also deeply pragmatic. Although he described the Soviet Union as “the evil empire,” he was quick to negotiate with Gorbachev. Soon after Hezbollah attacked the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, in 1983, killing two hundred and forty-one Americans, Reagan said that a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon would send a “signal to terrorists everywhere: they can gain by waging war against innocent people.” But then he did it anyway, after concluding that the troops’ mission was unclear and that their presence offered too inviting a target to extremists.","2499","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This strain of pragmatism was powerful enough that George W. Bush called for a “humble” foreign policy in his 2000 campaign, and condemned the kinds of democracy-building interventions for which he would later become known. Cruz strives to return the G.O.P. to its pre-9/11 philosophy. “If and when U.S. military force is required,” he told me, “it should, No. 1, always be to directly further the vital national security of the United States. No. 2, we should use overwhelming force. And, No. 3, we should get the heck out. It should not be the objective of our armed forces to engage in nation-building, to transform foreign nations into robust, utopian democracies.”","2500","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"While many Republicans now criticize Obama for not doing enough in Syria, Cruz was among those who opposed Obama’s 2013 request to strike Syria. “He repeatedly tried to justify this as ‘vindicating international norms,’ or as ‘the violation of international law,’ ” Cruz said. “It’s not the job of our military to behave like a law professor in a faculty lounge, vindicating international law. It’s the job of our military to protect the safety and security of three hundred and thirty million Americans.” He said that although “Assad is a monster” who “has used poison gas” and “killed hundreds of thousands of his own citizens,” he worries about what might happen “if the attack succeeds and you topple Assad, and the weapons then fall into the hands of Al Qaeda or Al Nusra or ISIS or any of the other radical Islamic terrorists.” (Donald Trump has said that he’s happy to have Russia in Syria fighting ISIS, though he failed to note that, so far, Russia has been mainly targeting U.S.-trained rebels, not ISIS.)","2501","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz added that the military commanders he has consulted insist that “the most potent tool to use against ISIS is overwhelming airpower.” He maintained that arming the Kurds in northern Iraq was a better alternative to sending U.S. troops. “We need boots on the ground, but they don’t necessarily need to be American boots,” he said. “The Kurds are our boots on the ground.”","2502","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But Cruz’s prescription may be more like Reagan’s supply-side tax cuts than like Reagan’s foreign policy: it promises enormous benefits with very little sacrifice. Graham, who wants American troops to lead the fight, scoffed at Cruz’s argument. “The Kurds don’t have any offensive capability,” he said, pointing out that Shiites and non-Kurdish Sunnis in Iraq and Syria would be as concerned about Kurdish advances as they are about ISIS. “They’re not gonna go down to Ramadi! Go ask the Kurds, ‘Would you help us liberate Syria?’ And they’d say, ‘Thank you, but no thank you.’ If you want to create a war to end all wars, have a marauding band of Kurds going through the Middle East.”","2503","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz has calculated that, despite the rise of ISIS, Republican voters are still hungover from the costly interventions of the Bush years, and that they share his skepticism about the ability of American troops to accomplish much in Iraq and Syria. “There are some politicians in Washington who approach foreign military action as if they’re playing Risk,” he said. “They want to deploy troops and command them in battle.” He added, “A number of politicians treat American boots on the ground as a talisman to demonstrate that they’re really tough.”","2504","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama, who has said that he was elected to end wars, not start them, has bombed more countries than George W. Bush did. But in fighting terrorism he has chosen to use drones and other forms of airpower, Special Forces, and proxy armies. Obama was skeptical about intervening to stop Muammar Qaddafi’s forces as they marched on a helpless population in Benghazi, Libya. He had to be talked into the operation by, among others, Hillary Clinton, and the result—a failed state in Libya that has created a haven for terrorists—shaped his skepticism about intervening in Syria.","2505","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Early on, key Republicans seemed to endorse Obama’s cautious approach. When Marco Rubio ran for the Senate in 2010, he supported Obama’s drawdown of troops in Iraq. As a former city commissioner in West Miami and then a state legislator, Rubio knew the foreign-policy issues that important Florida constituencies care about, such as the Jewish community’s staunchly pro-Israel views and the Cuban-American community’s fierce opposition to Castro. He had little experience with broader foreign-policy questions. In his early months in Congress, he supported attempts at diplomacy with Iran. During the 2013 fight over budget cuts, Rubio advocated for government-spending reform. He has since grown less cautionary, arguing for an increase in military spending and calling it the “most important obligation of the federal government.”","2506","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, who was a leader in the Florida House while Jeb Bush was governor and is now his nearest opponent in the race, though they are both well behind Trump and Carson in most national polls, has recently positioned himself as one of the most hawkish Republicans running for President. McCain noted that Rubio, like others, had shifted into his camp after the emergence of ISIS, and he joked that Rubio has a history of switching positions, which McCain gently mocked by licking his finger and holding it in the air.","2507","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Recently, Rubio told me that he no longer believes that Obama’s drawdown was wise. “We are retreating from Afghanistan and Iraq, not anticipating the vacuum that would be left behind and the potential that creates for radicalism,” he said. His shift might seem political, but he suggested that it was the result of becoming immersed in issues, as a senator, to which, as a candidate, he had given little thought. He noted that some of his opponents, including Jeb Bush, have never held federal office. “I’m a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee,” Rubio said. “I spend a significant amount of time working on these issues on a daily basis. So most certainly I’m going to have more insight than someone reading briefings from the staffers.”","2508","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio’s foreign policy is a clear response to Obama’s alleged retreat from the world. The President’s biggest mistakes, in this view, were all failures to intervene more aggressively. Rubio has said that he would have forcefully taken the side of demonstrators in Iran during the 2009 Green Revolution. “The President was so intent on negotiating with Iran’s tyrants that he did little to help its people,” he remarked in a speech in Washington in 2011.","2509","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But the key issue for many emerging Republican hawks was Obama’s failure to attack Assad when he used chemical weapons. Obama had drawn a “red line,” but then retreated. Instead, he accepted a deal negotiated with Putin to place the weapons under international control. “Everyone heard him,” Reich said. “He said, ‘I didn’t draw the red line, the world drew a red line.’ No, Mr. President, the world didn’t stand before the cameras in the White House and say that it was drawing a red line; you did. . . . It’s very dangerous.”","2510","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"George Shultz, who is ninety-four and is also a Bush adviser, was Reagan’s Secretary of State. He said that the red line was one of the biggest mistakes of Obama’s Presidency. “I don’t think the President realizes how much damage was done,” he said. “I remember when I was in marine boot camp, at the start of World War Two, and the sergeant hands me this rifle and says, ‘Take good care of this rifle—this is your best friend. Remember one thing: never point this rifle at anybody unless you’re willing to pull the trigger.’ No empty threats. That’s boot-camp wisdom. With Obama there are empty threats lying all over the place, and they undermine his credibility.”","2511","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This outlook relies on some revisionist history. When Obama asked Congress for authorization to bomb Syria in 2013, several Republicans, Rubio among them, voted against the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others announced that they would oppose it on the Senate floor. It never came to a vote. Rubio said that the Administration’s proposed attack was not sufficiently robust; now he cites the failure to use force as the reason for much of the current chaos, including Putin’s recent involvement.","2512","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio told me that years ago he warned that the power vacuums in the Middle East were being filled by Islamic extremists, and he noted ISIS’s growing role in Afghanistan, where it had previously had little presence. “If they continue unabated a year from now, we could live in a world where ISIS is now operating in vacated spaces in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya,” he said. Rubio is a favorite of G.O.P. hawks. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas billionaire who spent some $100 million in the 2012 election and is wooed by almost every Republican candidate, is reportedly also a fan. But Rubio sounds more cautious when asked for details about how to defeat ISIS.","2513","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“Intervening doesn’t mean ground troops,” he said. “Intervening can be a lot of things.” He went on, “A full-scale invasion, sending a hundred thousand troops to Iraq right now, is probably not the best way to defeat ISIS. Because it very well may be what they hope will happen, because it will allow them to point to radicals around the world and attract more recruits and more funding. I think that the better approach is to empower Sunni tribes to defeat them. And they need a lot of help from us, including air strikes and special-op forces.”","2514","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"What Rubio laid out wasn’t very different from Obama’s current plan. When pressed, he conceded that many more American troops might be necessary. “There’s no magic number,” he said. “I don’t know if nine thousand is worse than eleven thousand. What matters is: first you have to establish a mission—what are you trying to achieve? Then you have to allow the military to come up with operations and how to achieve that mission. And that will determine the number in the mission, not the other way around.”","2515","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, Graham, and many other Republicans believe that the nation’s foreign policy suffers from timidity, not from overexertion. The problem is in the execution, not the intervention itself. “Here’s what I’ve learned,” Graham told me. “If you don’t have a plan after you take Afghanistan down, after you take Iraq down, after you take Libya down, after you take Syria down, you’re going to regret it.”","2516","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Given the failed states and the civil wars gripping Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, I asked Graham for an example of a successful intervention that would bolster his case for a more hawkish foreign policy. We were sitting outside, in Manchester, New Hampshire, and he was eating nachos. He looked at me excitedly, racing to swallow so that he could get to his answer: “How about Germany and Japan?”","2517","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Even as Bush watches his opponents solidify their foreign-policy positions, he has struggled to come to terms with his brother’s ideology. His opponents criticize him for being vague or unengaged. Graham told me, “I think he’s a work-in-progress. I think he’s been out of the game for ten years. . . . He’s gotta convince people that three Bushes are not one too many.”","2518","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb Bush’s troubles began almost as soon as he declared his candidacy and included the eighty-five-year-old James Baker on his list. As Communism began to collapse, in 1989, Bush and Baker helped engineer a soft landing for the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the gradual reorientation of Europe’s Eastern Bloc countries toward the West. Hawks pilloried them for not asserting themselves strongly enough. When Bush went to Kiev, Ukraine, for instance, and warned Ukrainians not to secede from the Soviet Union, the address was mocked as the “chicken Kiev” speech. In 1991, after assembling a United Nations-backed coalition to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, Bush and Baker ignored the pleas of American neoconservatives who wanted U.S. forces to march on Baghdad and overthrow Saddam following the uprisings against his rule. They were again demonized. Wolfowitz said that it was as if America were “idly watching a mugging.” In 2006, Baker co-chaired the Iraq Study Group, which recommended a dramatic change in Bush’s policy in the Middle East, including the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq and diplomatic engagement with Iran and Syria, policies that Bush rejected.","2519","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"When Baker appeared on Jeb Bush’s list, neoconservatives expressed alarm. His foreign-policy views—diplomacy, stability, and serious doubts about interventions requiring large numbers of U.S. troops—are closer to Obama’s than to George W. Bush’s. Jeb Bush faced a revolt from donors and excoriation in neoconservative publications. A few weeks after Jeb’s announcement, Baker was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a Washington gala dinner for J Street, the liberal-leaning pro-Israel group founded in 2008 to act as a counterweight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Commentary published an article about “Jeb Bush’s James Baker Problem” and warned that Jeb may be Baker’s “kindred spirit.” Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, wrote that “Jeb Bush turns to Israel-hater, Jim Baker, for foreign policy advice.” Adelson reportedly sent word to Bush that he should pressure Baker to cancel the speech. Bush declined, and Adelson’s allies leaked that Adelson wouldn’t support Bush.","2520","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At the J Street dinner, Baker criticized Benjamin Netanyahu for “diplomatic missteps and political gamesmanship,” and spoke about his own role in the first Bush Administration’s withholding of loan guarantees to Israel in order to pressure the government to halt settlement construction. William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, called Baker “anti-Israel,” and tweeted, “Thankfully, James Baker doesn’t speak for today’s Republican Party.” Morton Klein, the president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, told Bloomberg that Bush’s association with Baker would cost the candidate: “There are many mega-donors who will not be with him because of that.”","2521","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In May, Bush appeared in New York, at the Metropolitan Club, before an audience of financiers organized by Paul Singer, a hedge-fund manager and the kind of Republican mega-donor Klein had warned about. Someone asked Bush to explain Baker’s influence on his policymaking. According to the Washington Post, Jeb “said that he respected Baker, but maintained that he is not part of his foreign-policy team.” CNN, which cited four sources and the notes of someone present, quotes Bush as saying, “What you need to know is that who I listen to when I need advice on the Middle East is George W. Bush.” The Bush campaign later insisted that Jeb was speaking narrowly about Israeli policy. Either way, the message was clear: the hawks were back in control of Republican foreign policy.","2522","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Lately, in his effort to be his “own man,” Bush has displayed a willingness to move even further to the right than his brother. At the October 2nd interview in South Carolina, Wilson asked him about the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay. During George W. Bush’s tenure, the prison became such a source of shame for America that even Bush, who was loath to acknowledge mistakes or to bow to international pressure, said in 2007, “It should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantánamo.” Jeb disagrees. Wilson asked if Guantánamo prisoners should be moved to maximum-security facilities in the U.S. “No,” Jeb said. “There is no option for these folks. They should stay where they are. Even if it’s—it’s expensive. It’s the nicest prison you’ll ever want to be in, by the way. And the rights of these terrorists are way beyond what a lot of people get in a lot of different circumstances. They’re not being mistreated at all. But there is no other option.”","2523","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"If the economy improves, and Democrats continue to maintain an advantage on domestic issues, the Republican candidates will increasingly highlight foreign policy, an area of perceived vulnerability for Obama and Clinton. McCain, who lost to Obama in 2008, said, perhaps hopefully, “National security, foreign policy, and terrorism will play a greater role in the decision-making of the American people than at any time since 1980.” He insisted that although Bush’s record on foreign policy contributed to his own defeat, “it has gone from a significant negative” at the start of the Obama Administration “to what has become more and more of a positive.”","2524","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In August, Bush travelled to Simi Valley, California, to give a speech on foreign policy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Bush called Reagan “a leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words,” someone “who took command of events, rebuilt America’s strength, and moved the world toward peace.” But when he shifted from Reagan’s Cold War successes to more recent events his speech sounded more like a tribute to the Administration of George W. Bush.","2525","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially,” he said. But he argued that, whatever mistakes were made, it was the surge of troops in 2007 that “turned events toward victory.” The surge “was a success—brilliant, heroic, and costly.” It was Obama who lost Iraq, not his brother. The “premature withdrawal was the fatal error,” Jeb said, referring to Obama’s gradual drawdown, “creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill—and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.”","2526","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He then turned this logic against the Democrats’ most likely nominee. “ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat,” he said. “And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the President himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.”","2527","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Clinton herself has tried to create some distance from Obama’s record. Since leaving the Administration, she has repeatedly said that as Secretary of State she urged Obama to do more in the early days of the Syrian uprising against Assad, when moderates could still be found in that country and American intervention could, arguably, have made a difference. Obama has dismissed that view as “a fantasy.” But, whatever Clinton actually believes about the correct course in the Middle East, she has already shown that she will adopt the campaign position that best suits her politically. In early October, facing a challenge from the left from Bernie Sanders, she reversed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that she championed as Secretary of State.","2528","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"It’s easy to attack Obama as feckless in the face of the chaos in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Less apparent is how to translate vague campaign promises to do something into a plan that won’t put more American lives at risk. After Jeb Bush spoke with Wilson in South Carolina, he met with reporters backstage. His aides were scrambling to contain any fallout from the “stuff happens” remark, which had immediately elicited a response from President Obama, and echoed one of the most notorious statements of the Bush Administration: Rumsfeld’s declaration during the chaos in Iraq that “stuff happens.” After defending his remark, Jeb Bush then took some questions about Syria, Iraq, and Putin.","2529","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria that would help a Sunni-led army fight a two-front war against Assad and ISIS, but it’s unclear who would make up the forces. He told reporters that American airpower in Syria is “restricted by lawyers kind of imposing all sorts of conditions.” He would change the rules, he said, so “that it would be there to fight to win.” He didn’t specify which rules he would lift, but, as Graham noted, almost every military expert dismisses the idea that airpower alone can defeat ISIS. “The only way you destroy a big ground opponent is with another big ground opponent,” Graham told me. “You’re not going to bomb ISIL into submission. You gotta go tear the caliphate up by the roots. That means going into Syria on the ground.”","2530","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"To fight ISIS in Iraq, Bush made the familiar argument that America should arm the Kurds and “embed with the Iraqi military,” both of which Obama is effectively doing. When asked whether he would send more troops, Bush said that the U.S. already has thirty-five hundred troops in Iraq and that the real issue was how to better integrate them into Iraqi forces. Pressed further, he conceded, in a roundabout way, that he would be willing to send more American troops back to Iraq.","2531","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I would listen to the military commanders and I would create a strategy,” he said, a phrase that politicians revert to whenever they want to avoid details. “If it required more supportive troops, fine.” The statement was a reminder of Bush’s continuing dilemma: can he get the nomination without violating his principles? In the months since the start of his campaign, he has only clouded the matter of what, precisely, he stands for.","2532","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At one point, someone asked Bush a churlish question about his father’s 1991 statement regarding the possibility of “a new world order” after the Cold War ended.

"“I don’t even know what that means anymore,” he said. “In 1992, it meant the end of Communism, and that the United States needed to play a constructive role in forging peace and security, and we still have that role to play. We have threats that are created by our absence. Just look at what’s going on in Syria as an example of that, where we have no strategy, where Putin, agile as he is, ends up injecting himself into something that makes it harder for me to imagine that this brutal Assad regime will depart.” He thought for a moment and added, “American leadership matters.” ♦","2534","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don’t trust the media,” Senator Ted Cruz said last night, drawing himself up in a way that made him appear to slightly inflate. Sweeping his arm across the stage, at the University of Colorado, in Boulder, he said, “This is not a cage match. And, you look at the questions: ‘Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?’ ‘Ben Carson, can you do math?’ ‘John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?’ ‘Marco Rubio, why don’t you resign?’ ‘Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?’ How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?” He got a big round of applause, which Carlos Quintanilla, one of the moderators for CNBC, tried to interrupt, asking, “Do we get credit…,” before Cruz interrupted him again.","October 29, 2015","2535","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was ‘Which of you is more handsome and why?’ ” Cruz said. That wasn’t quite how anyone who saw that debate would remember it, but the Senator just shook his head, compared the Democrats to “the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks,” and wondered at the implausibility of a debate moderator voting in a Republican primary. Quintanilla tried again to be heard over the laughter of the crowd before he managed to say, somewhat forlornly, “I asked you about the debt limit and I got no answer.”","2536","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"For the record, this was the question that inspired Cruz’s rant about insubstantiality: “Congressional Republicans, Democrats, and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of—another Washington-created crisis is on the way. Does your opposition to it show that you’re not the kind of problem-solver American voters want?” Given that Cruz’s previous responses to such crises have included filibustering the Senate with a reading of “Green Eggs and Ham,” and that he has, in just the past month, been involved in a squabble with his fellow-Republicans over his efforts to make the debt ceiling a hostage in the fight against Planned Parenthood, it was a pretty good question, which Cruz blithely ignored. And yet, in the brief tussle that followed, Cruz managed to make it sound as if he were being unjustly denied a chance to turn to the debt ceiling as the questioning moved on to the next candidate.","2537","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"Even before the debate ended, CNBC was being roundly criticized—Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, tweeted that CNBC “should be ashamed of how this debate was handled”—and, to be clear, the moderators did fail. But not for the reasons that the Republican candidates gave: Rubio said that “the Democrats have the ultimate Super PAC. It’s called the mainstream media”; Carson called a question “propaganda”; Chris Christie complained that he wasn’t being asked about ISIS, even though this was a debate about business and the economy. Nor was it because their questions were especially marked by infotainment froth. It is because the moderators utterly failed to control a group of candidates whose level of detachment from facts and vitriol seemed to surprise them when it shouldn’t have.","2538","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"It’s unclear what anyone’s best-case scenario for this debate would have been, in terms of real engagement with the issues. The shallowness of much of the rhetoric in the campaign can lead to simple questions that, to some ears, sound simplistic, but have to be asked, such as why the math in Carson’s very vague budget proposals doesn’t add up, or why, as another moderator, John Harwood, asked Donald Trump, his talk about forcing Mexico to build a wall “and make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others” (Trump: “That’s right”) didn’t amount to “a comic-book version of a Presidential campaign.” The moderators just didn’t account for the pits of deep ugliness in those shallows and didn’t know how to navigate them. They weren’t prepared for candidates who called them liars, and who, by the end, were simply ignoring both questions and time limits. Carly Fiorina, notably, just started talking when she wanted; at the very end, she had a brief blinking contest with Harwood, who surrendered with a weary “All right, go ahead.” Again, by this point in the campaign, the moderators really should have known better.","2539","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"For example, when Becky Quick asked Trump why he’d been critical of Mark Zuckerberg’s call for more H1B visas for tech workers, and Trump denied that he had been, she seemed surprised, saying, “Where did I read this and come up with this that you were?”—as if he would tell her. “I don’t know—you people write the stuff,” Trump said. A minute later, when Quick tried to follow up by noting that Trump had called Marco Rubio “Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator because he was in favor of the H1B,” Trump replied, “I never said that. I never said that.”","2540","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?” Quick said. “My apologies. I’m sorry.” It took until after a commercial break for her to discover that the quotes had come from Trump’s own Web site. He didn’t apologize, and it didn’t matter. Cruz had set a model for his colleagues that night: people hate reporters. Just insult them and you’ll be fine, regardless of the question you’ve been asked. It was similar to a moment Newt Gingrich had, during a debate in 2012, when he gained momentum by telling off John King, of CNN. But that was a rejection of questions about Gingrich’s personal life (“despicable” questions, Gingrich said) and not of fact-based queries altogether.","2541","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"There were some bad and petty questions. Quick pressed too much and with too much alarm about Rubio, the father of four school-age children, taking money out of his retirement savings, at a cost to him and his family of thousands of dollars. It’s more Suze Orman’s job to berate people about things like that, and what Rubio did is neither unethical nor disqualifying. Then again, it allowed him to play to his strengths, saying, “Here’s the truth. I didn’t inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.” He said that after getting married he had to explain to his wife “why someone named Sallie Mae was taking a thousand dollars out of our bank account every month.” Rubio did well all around (my colleague John Cassidy writes about why he was the big winner), including when Jeb Bush tried, with an ill-conceived feint, to cut him down.","2542","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"The issue was Rubio’s frequent absence from the Senate—the occasion for another of the questions Cruz objected to, based on a call in an editorial in Florida’s Sun-Sentinel for Rubio to resign. Rubio had already dealt with the question, inevitably, by attacking the press: “It’s actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today,” he said of the editorial. Bush asked if he could jump in, “because I’m a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.” Whoever told Bush, who so often in his life has been given well-paid opportunities through family or political connections, that he should put Rubio in his place by calling him an employee who had failed to provide good “service” is not advising him very well. When Rubio asked why Bush didn’t mind that Senator John McCain, whom he’d cited as a model, had missed a lot of votes, Bush underscored the patron play by saying, “He wasn’t my senator.”","2543","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” Rubio said. And maybe it would have, if Bush had any aptitude for this sort of thing. But he lost the stage, having demonstrated only the sort of petulance that he showed last weekend, when he complained that there were a lot of “really cool things” that he could be doing besides running for President. His only memorable moment came when he bragged about how well his fantasy-football team was doing—“Gronkowski is still going strong!”—better, it seems, than his fantasy Presidential campaign.","2544","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"
"The Republicans might have liked a “successful” debate even less. Trump’s campaign had fought with CNBC to make sure that the debate wouldn’t go too long and that there would be closing statements, and Trump used that time to say that he had fought CNBC and won: “In about two minutes, I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.” But, once we do go out, where do we go?","2545","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-partial-defense-of-cnbc"

Back in February, Walker delighted conservatives with a speech in Iowa, and, in late March, he briefly rose to the top of the Real Clear Politics poll average. Fastening on his blue-collar roots, his record as a liberal-defying union buster, and his potential to unite economic conservatives and social conservatives, many commentators, this one included, identified him as a serious contender for the nomination. So did some big-time Republican donors, including David Koch, who said that Walker would be the G.O.P. nominee, and Anthony Scaramucci, a fund manager from New York, who predicted that Walker would become the forty-fifth President.","2547","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-moneymen-and-supporters-vote-scott-walker-off-the-island"
"Fast forward to Monday evening, when Walker delivered a four-minute statement at the Edgewater Hotel, in Madison. He recalled standing onstage with the other candidates at the Ronald Reagan Library, in Simi Valley, last week, and thinking about how, when he was a kid, Reagan’s “eternal optimism” had appealed to him. “Sadly the debate taking place in the Republican Party today is not focussed on that optimistic view of America,” Walker said. “Instead it has drifted into personal attacks. In the end, I believe that the voters want to be for something, and not against someone. Instead of talking about how bad things are, we want to hear how we can make them better for everyone. We need to get back to the basics of our party.”","2548","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-moneymen-and-supporters-vote-scott-walker-off-the-island"
"Walker didn’t mention Trump by name—he didn’t have to. Like Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, who dropped out of the race two weeks ago, and like all the other regular politicians who are still in the contest, Walker suffered gravely from Trump’s ability to suck attention away from everybody else, save for those candidates who attacked Trump or were attacked by him. “I was sitting in church yesterday; the pastor’s words reminded me that the Bible is full of stories about people who were called to be leaders in unusual ways,” Walker went on. “Today, I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field. With this in mind, I will suspend my campaign immediately. I encourage other Republican Presidential candidates to consider doing the same, so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive conservative alternative to the current front-runner.”","2549","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-moneymen-and-supporters-vote-scott-walker-off-the-island"
"In truth, Walker’s campaign was faltering even before mid-June, when Trump got into the race. Early on, a number of his statements had raised questions about his knowledge of national and international issues, and about whether he could make the jump from local to national politics. (While touting his foreign-policy credentials, for example, he appeared to equate pro-labor union demonstrators with members of ISIS and other deadly groups, remarking, “If I can take on a hundred thousand protesters, I can do the same across the world.”) In April and May, his poll numbers dropped back. Indeed, in an interview with Byron York, of the Washington Examiner, Walker conceded that his rapid rise in the spring had caught him off guard. “We thought all along if we got in, it would be kind of this slow and steady, ‘Don’t worry about the other guys, just keep focused on moving forward,’ and as candidates chose not to get in or fell off, we’d be in a position to make a compelling case to them,” he said.","2550","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-moneymen-and-supporters-vote-scott-walker-off-the-island"
"But if Walker made some rookie errors, Trump’s arrival on the scene raised the stakes and accelerated the pace for all of the candidates. What had seemed as though it would be a lengthy war of attrition turned into a popularity contest carried on in the full glare of the national media, with Trump stealing most of the attention. Walker, it turned out, wasn’t well suited to this type of politics. A somewhat stiff public speaker, he went largely unnoticed in the first televised debate. In the second, last week, he, at times, seemed to be reciting sound bites that he had rehearsed, and which weren’t very clever. For example, addressing Trump, he said that America couldn’t afford another “apprentice” in the White House, which raised the question of whether he actually knew what role the billionaire played in the long-running reality show. In a CNN poll carried out in the days after the debate, his support among likely Republican voters fell below one per cent, earning him a dreaded asterisk in the tabulated results.","2551","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-moneymen-and-supporters-vote-scott-walker-off-the-island"
"Even before the CNN debate, Walker’s campaign appears to have been in worse trouble than most outsiders realized. As Trump’s poll numbers rose and fell, Walker’s ability to raise money, the lifeblood of any Presidential campaign—particularly one that was spending heavily to build a national infrastructure—was gravely undermined. Much of the cash that Walker had raised had already been spent, and, according to some reports, his staff members were having trouble attracting people to a fundraiser scheduled this week in New York. An article in the Times, which broke the story of Walker’s withdrawal, said that “campaign bills were piling up, with some vendors complaining that they had not been paid on time.” The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wisconsin’s largest newspaper, quoted a G.O.P. source who said, “If it wasn’t for cash flow, he’d still be here.”","2552","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-moneymen-and-supporters-vote-scott-walker-off-the-island"
"Rather than borrowing money and racking up big debts, Walker evidently accepted the verdict of the moneymen and debate viewers. Now that he’s done, the pundits are busy picking over his entrails, with the early consensus being that Senator Marco Rubio is likely to prove the primary beneficiary of his demise. Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster and Trump antagonist, remarked to BuzzFeed that “a lot of Walker supporters had Rubio as their second choice, and a lot of Rubio supporters had Walker as their second choice.” Indeed, immediately after Walker’s announcement, some of his most prominent supporters in New Hampshire had thrown their support to Rubio.","2553","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-moneymen-and-supporters-vote-scott-walker-off-the-island"
"Walker’s foes, meanwhile, celebrated his departure. Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who called the Wisconsin Governor “a national disgrace” on the day that Walker declared his candidacy, said in a statement: “Scott Walker is still a disgrace, just no longer national.” As for Trump, when the news broke that Walker was dropping out, he tweeted graciously: “I got to know @ScottWalker well—he’s a very nice person and has a great future.” Later on Monday night, perhaps after watching Walker’s departure statement, Trump’s tone changed, as he referred on Twitter to the pledge that he and other candidates had signed, which commits them to supporting the G.O.P.’s eventual nominee. “What happened to The Pledge? Walker quits and slams Trump. Losers proving Pledge was sham,” he tweeted.","2554","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-moneymen-and-supporters-vote-scott-walker-off-the-island"

"“Governor Bush,” Maria Bartiromo, of Fox Business Network, said on Tuesday night, turning, for the first time in the Republican Presidential debate, to the man who was, many months ago, the front-runner. Five of the eight candidates had already spoken, everyone from Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, to Donald Trump, of the Tower, and only Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul remained when Bartiromo indicated that she wanted, at last, to hear from Jeb Bush. He was certainly eager. But, before Bush could say anything, another voice piped up. “Yeah—I would like to make a comment,” Kasich said.","November 11, 2015","2556","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"“You’ve already made two comments, John. It’s my turn,” Bush said, as if that should settle it. In case he hadn’t been clear, Bush added, “I got about four minutes in the last debate. I’m going to get my question right now.” He didn’t. Kasich, who had indeed already been given a question, a follow-up, and a chance to squeeze in an addendum about how he’d solved budget problems both as a congressman and as governor—“I’ll do it in Washington. I’ve done it twice; I’ll do it thrice for the United States of America”—kept talking, and ignored Bartiromo’s remonstrances long enough to deliver a mini-soliloquy on the value-added tax. When it was finally, really, Bush’s turn, his expression was broken up by his lopsided smile, and his answer, to a question about how he’d encourage economic growth, by incoherencies and word pretzels. (“The growth that we don’t have makes—makes the deficit grow”; “I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them. … For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the Internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.”)","2557","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"Kasich, it seemed, had gone into the debate intending to interrupt it as often as possible. He did it twice, he did it thrice, but his most effective moves, in terms of time and momentum grabbing, were at the expense of Bush. At one point, Trump, a connoisseur of the varied tools of bullying, told Kasich, “You should let Jeb speak,” adding, as if surrendering, despite himself, to pity, “No—it’s unfair.” Then Trump and Kasich engaged in a multipart back-and-forth about immigration, which continued with no regard for Bush, until one of the moderators, Gerard Baker, the editor of the Wall Street Journal, appealed to the Donald: “Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, you yourself—you yourself said let Governor Bush speak.”","2558","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"“Thank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate. That’s really nice of you. Really appreciate that,” Bush said, when he regained the floor. “What a generous man you are.” Bush can somehow manage to sound simultaneously smug and resentful. It is not the most attractive mode for him, or the best setup for what followed. He started talking compassionately about immigration but ended up simply despairing about the votes that Trump’s calls for mass deportation would cost the G.O.P. in the general election. Does he still think that he will be the candidate in that race? Kasich didn’t seem to worry about sabotaging a future appointment in the Bush 45 Administration.","2559","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"This was a better debate for Bush than the last one, two weeks ago, in Colorado, when he sought out humiliation with a failed challenge to Marco Rubio. But, in a way, the absence of a distracting faux pas made this performance worse: mediocrity as a debater may be his new normal, to borrow one of Bush’s preferred phrases. When Bush was asked about another financial crisis, he offered a hard-to-diagram answer that seemed to assume that the audience already knew how and why raising capital requirements would prevent concentration in the banking industry. (It also included this Bushism, about a meeting with a financial executive in Iowa: “It was—get the—kind of the—anyway. We had—it—and I talked to a banker there.”) Rubio followed by essentially making the same point, but translated into direct, emotional language, after which Kasich twisted the knife by offering to explain “what Jeb is talking about … what he’s trying to say.”","2560","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"Bush tried to do a little interrupting of his own, after Trump resolved a reverie about the time he and Vladimir Putin were “stablemates” before their respective appearances on “60 Minutes” by saying, “If Putin wants to go and knock the hell out of ISIS, I am all for it, one hundred per cent, and I can’t understand how anybody would be against it.”","2561","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"“They’re not doing that!” Bush said. He had an answer on this one and wanted everyone to know it.","2562","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"“Hold it,” Trump said—and, after emitting a strangled phrase, Bush did. Trump went on to expound on the effect that the downed Russian plane would have on Putin’s mentality (“He cannot be in love with these people”); the failure of our European allies to pull their weight (“They say, ‘Keep going, keep going, you dummies, keep going. Protect us!’ ”); and, even after the bell rang to signal that his time was up, about the need to spend money on infrastructure rather than on policing the world (“We have a country that’s going to hell”). Bush was bursting by the time he finally got his say.","2563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"“Donald—Donald’s wrong on this. He is absolutely wrong on this,” he said. Mixing up Trump’s already muddled concept a bit, he continued, “The idea that it’s a good idea for Putin to be in Syria, let ISIS take out Assad, and then Putin will take out ISIS? I mean, that’s like a board game, that’s like playing Monopoly or something.” But the alternative that Bush offered—a no-fly zone and a commitment that “we have to lead, we have to be involved”—sounded a bit like throwing out the Monopoly board in favor of a staring contest. Trump just started talking again, and momentarily veered toward what sounded like a non-interventionist position, regretting that Middle Eastern conflicts had left “wounded warriors all over the place—who I love, O.K.?—all over the place,” before announcing that the real problem in Iraq was that “we should have kept the oil, believe me. … We should’ve given big chunks to the people that lost their arms, their legs, and their families, and their sons, and daughters.” How these chunks of oil would have been delivered was not clear.","2564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"There was, by G.O.P. debate standards, a fairly serious exchange on the intervention question; the protagonists, though, were Rubio and Rand Paul. Paul had criticized Rubio’s child-tax-credit plan as being fiscally irresponsible and thus not conservative. Rubio responded by calling Paul “a committed isolationist,” and thus not conservative. Paul didn’t mind engaging. Neither did Rubio, who had been hindered, in part, by the softness of some of the debate questions; he couldn’t resist the temptation to simply recite lines he’d clearly said before. (The moderators were unashamedly concerned, until the very end, that the candidates might yell at them, as they did at CNBC’s moderators last month; with these questions, there was no danger.) Along the way, they brushed off an attempt by Kasich to interrupt. It was more illuminating than Carly Fiorina saying that, unlike Trump, with his “60 Minutes” stable, she had met Putin “not in a green room for a show but in a private meeting.” That was mostly useful as a reminder of her habit of saying things that aren’t quite accurate: in September, she told Jimmy Fallon that she’d met Putin as they were both waiting to speak at a conference in Beijing: “We were in sort of a green-room setting, actually.” Trump, in a reminder of his habits, said, at one point, to the group at large, “Why does she keep interrupting everybody?”","2565","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"
"Why wouldn’t Fiorina, or any of them, interrupt? This field is still in flux—either that, or Trump or Ben Carson (who joked about recent attacks on his biography) will be the nominee. They are each at about twenty-five per cent in the polls; Bush is at eight per cent. The number of debaters on the main stage was eight this time, rather than ten, but the reduction has resulted not in the coalescing of support around a front-runner but in the emergence of more back-benchers—Ted Cruz, like Kasich, had an active night. Paul seems to have benefitted more than anyone from the absence, last night, of Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee, who were relegated to the undercard, where they spent their time dodging questions and provoking Bobby Jindal. Paul is now the loud, assertive voice at one end of the row, while Jeb Bush, at the other, standing on his toes for attention, is the dismayed one.","2566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-interrupt-jeb-bush"

"The days when Labor Day marked the beginning of the electoral season have long gone. Thanks to information technology, money, and the Supreme Court, we live in the era of the permanent campaign. But the end of summer still feels like a significant marker, and it provides a good moment to take stock of a set of events that surely would have prompted the good Doctor, had he been alive to chronicle them, to send out for another bottle of Wild Turkey.","2568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Let’s start, as we must, at Trump Tower, where, last Thursday, Reince Priebus, the boyish-looking forty-three-year-old who has the unenviable task of heading up the Republican National Committee, presented a piece of paper to the fellow whose name is on the building. “I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,” the words on the paper said. “I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.” Donald Trump filled in his name in a blank space at the start of the text and signed at the bottom. He or someone else got the date wrong, writing August 3rd instead of September 3rd, but that didn’t matter: the deed had been done.","2569","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"A few weeks ago, when the loyalty pledge was first mooted, it looked like a clever insurance policy for the Republicans. After all, if Trump were to run as an independent and win even four or five per cent of the vote, he could easily hand the Presidential election to the Democrats. But as Trump extended and enlarged his position as the G.O.P. frontrunner, Priebus’s ploy came to take on a rather different aspect. From the vantage of Trump and his advisers, it must have seemed as if the Republican establishment, which they hold in utter disdain, were repeating the mistake of the Trojans and pulling the Greek horse into its midst.","2570","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"If Trump’s candidacy fails, as Priebus and his colleagues are dearly hoping that it will, whoever wins the Republican nomination won’t have to worry about Trump running as a third-party candidate: that’s the theory, anyway. But for the author of “The Art of the Deal,” this was a concession well worth making. For one thing, it assured him that his name will be on the G.O.P. primary ballot in every state, including those, like South Carolina, that had made (or threatened to make) a loyalty pledge a pre-condition for participating. Secondly, the signed pledge goes at least some way toward immunizing Trump against the charge that Jeb Bush had levelled at him on the very morning he signed it: that he isn’t a real conservative, or even a genuine Republican.","2571","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Finally, and most importantly from Trump’s standpoint, if all the other G.O.P. hopefuls go down—or rather, if they fail to get up from the prostrate position Trump’s summer stampede through the polls has left most of them in—the pledge insures that Trump will be guaranteed the support of the party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. As Jim Newell remarked at Slate, “Trump has not pledged to incorporate into his candidacy any of the cheerier tones or traditional Republican policies that the GOP establishment would like to see from him. The Republican Party, though, has agreed to incorporate Trump.” No wonder that, once Preibus had left, Trump called in the press and said he “will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands.” He added: “We will go out and fight hard, and we will win. We will win.”","2572","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"That remains an unlikely outcome, but not nearly as unlikely as it seemed a couple of months ago. Monmouth University’s poll data for June showed Trump’s favorable rating among likely Republican voters to be twenty per cent and his unfavorable rating to be fifty-five per cent. In Monmouth’s latest poll, which was released last week, Trump’s favorable rating among Republicans had jumped to fifty-nine per cent, and his unfavorable rating had fallen to twenty-nine per cent. Even in an era of declining party loyalty and footloose voters, these numbers represent an astonishing turnaround—and one that has sent pollsters searching, largely in vain, for a historical analogy. It isn’t unheard of for a previously unknown candidate to take off like a rocket before exploding at high altitude. But Trump wasn’t an unknown. He was a familiar television personality and blowhard, about whom the majority of Republicans harbored critical opinions. In just a couple of months, he has reversed many of those opinions, raising his positive rating by nearly forty percentage points and lowering his negative rating by almost thirty points.","2573","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Political scientists will be arguing for years about how he managed this feat. Clearly, his critical comments about Mexicans, and his pledge to deport as many as eleven million undocumented immigrants, struck a chord, as did his promise to renegotiate trade agreements that have cost jobs. But what really seems to have enthused the Republican electorate is Trump’s renegade attitude toward the Party establishment and the press. Every time he describes Washington as a hopeless cesspit, paints Jeb Bush as an ineffectual ninny, and jumps on anybody in the media who tries to question him, his numbers go up. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Real Clear Politics poll average showed him leading Ben Carson, another political outsider, by 27.8 per cent to 13.5 per cent at the national level, with all the other candidates stuck in single figures.","2574","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Developments on the Democratic side have been a bit less dramatic, but pretty remarkable nonetheless. At the start of the year, practically nobody in Washington took seriously the prospect of a Bernie Sanders Presidential candidacy. Indeed, some Hillary Clinton supporters were hoping that he would run, on the grounds that he would fill a potentially dangerous void to the left of Clinton with an unelectable presence. Now Sanders is running well ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, the second primary state, and he’s gaining ground in Iowa, the first primary state.","2575","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The level of concern in the Clinton camp is perhaps best conveyed by two reports that appeared in the Times in the past few days, which were based on briefings from Clinton staffers and supporters. One of the stories said that, going forward, the candidate would seek to present a more likable side, demonstrating that she possesses a sense of humor and a beating heart. The other Times article said that the Clinton campaign is hoping to build a “political firewall across the South” starting on Super Tuesday, March 1st, when a dozen states, nine of them below the Mason-Dixon line, will vote in the Democratic primary. A firewall to contain Sanders? He was supposed to be incapable of lighting a gas stove, let alone sparking a raging brush fire.","2576","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"How did the Democratic primary come to this? Sanders deserves credit for recognizing that there is a resurgent progressive movement in the United States, one based on the proposition—shared by many Tea Party members, and even Trump—that American politics is now hopelessly corrupt. Once Elizabeth Warren made it clear that she wasn’t interested in acting as the movement’s standard-bearer in 2016, Sanders seized the opportunity. As the lone Socialist in Congress, he was never going to be accused of being an opportunist or a Johnny-come-lately to the progressive cause. But, at the age of seventy-three, he needed to show that he had the fire and the durability to be a Presidential candidate. This he has certainly done. Rather than engaging Clinton directly, he has stuck to the issues, calling for the public financing of elections, free enrollment at state universities, a breakup of the big banks, and a minimum wage of fifteen dollars an hour. All of these policies are popular, particularly with college-educated liberals, who have been flocking to Sanders in huge numbers.","2577","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The Vermont senator has earned his current position in the race. But he has also received a good deal of help from Clinton, who, despite the endorsement of many senior figures in the Party, is still struggling to recover from some self-inflicted wounds. Earlier in the year, when the stories about her private e-mail system and the tangled finances of the Clinton Global Foundation started to come out, it seemed like the money story would prove the most serious, but it is the e-mail saga that has plagued Clinton’s every step. It continues to damage her reputation. Recently, pollsters from Quinnipiac University asked a random sample of voters which word they most associated with various candidates. When Clinton’s name was mentioned, the three most popular answers were “liar,” “dishonest,” and “untrustworthy.”","2578","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"After this poll received a lot of publicity, some Hillary supporters argued that Quinnipiac had hyped the findings, and they raised some sound points. Out of a sample of fifteen hundred and sixty-three voters, a hundred and eighty-seven people answered “liar,” and it’s probably fair to assume that the vast majority were Republicans. (The sample contained six hundred and sixty-six self-identified Republicans.) Undoubtedly, much of the venom directed at Clinton is coming from ardent G.O.P. supporters, and this shouldn’t be overlooked. But it’s also true that her approval rating among independent and moderate voters has fallen sharply. In a P.P.P. poll released in April, fifty per cent of self-identified moderates had a favorable opinion of Clinton, and forty-one per cent had an unfavorable opinion. Now these numbers have flipped. A P.P.P. poll released last week showed that thirty-nine per cent of moderates view Clinton favorably, and forty-nine per cent view her unfavorably.*","2579","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The e-mail saga has surely helped to drive this turnaround. While Clinton’s insistence that she didn’t break any laws or violate any rules appears to be true, her explanation for why she did it—for the sake of convenience—beggars belief. The more she repeats this line, the harder it seems to be for voters to avoid the conclusion that she has something to hide. Last week, Clinton told NBC News’s Andrea Mitchell that she wasn’t thinking much about the server when she set it up. “We had so many problems around the world,” Clinton said. “I didn’t really stop and think, What kind of e-mail system will there be?” The day after the interview, the Washington Post reported that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer to set up the private e-mail server, maintain it, and keep it going. And in case you missed it, the staffer, Bryan Pagliano, has reportedly indicated that he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence rather than testify before Congress.","2580","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"To state the obvious, it’s a worrying situation for Clinton. In the past few months, she has laid out a series of liberal-leaning policies on everything from student loans to day care to short-termism on Wall Street. (On Tuesday, she outlined her plans for campaign-finance reform.) Once the televised Democratic debates get started, in October, this extensive and detailed platform, together with Clinton’s ability to master complex policy issues, should place her in a strong position. But for all the political good it’s done her so far, she could have spent her time quoting from the Book of Deuteronomy (or Thompson’s favorite, the Book of Revelation). In media coverage of the Clinton campaign, and particularly in broadcast coverage, the e-mail story has overshadowed everything else, and it isn’t going away.","2581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On Monday, the Times reported that an intelligence review has concluded that some of the information Clinton received at her personal account was “top secret,” although it wasn’t marked classified at the time. In all probability, there will be more such stories. Indeed, as Labor Day approached, Clinton appeared to be trapped in the same kind of three-sided vice that, over the decades, has crushed many Washington figures. Simultaneously, she had to contend with an F.B.I. investigation into whether classified information was mishandled; a hostile Congressional committee under the control of the opposition party; and a media eager to report any damaging leaks from the authorities. Small wonder that Vice-President Joe Biden was seriously considering a late entry into the Democratic race.","2582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"All this, and there are still five months until the first primary voter casts a ballot. Before crowning Trump or burying Clinton, it is worth keeping this reality in mind—and a few others, too, such as the fact that early leads in primary races often prove ephemeral. It is certainly possible that Trump will go ahead and win the Republican nomination, but as Larry Sabato and his colleagues at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics said of Trump, in a post at Politico on Monday, “It’s far more likely he will fade long before the primary season does.” Only now is he being subjected to sustained attacks from other Republicans, and, as yet, the media scrutiny of his record has been cursory. For instance, we are still awaiting the first major investigative report into how many undocumented immigrants are employed at the hotels and golf courses that bear Trump’s name. While his bombast has served him well so far, he could yet overreact to criticism and self-destruct.","2583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On the Democratic side, Clinton remains highly popular inside her own party, and she has the support of important interest groups that help to mobilize Democratic voters. In the latest national poll of Democrats and voters who lean Democrat, which was released by Monmouth on Tuesday, she was leading Biden by twenty percentage points and Sanders by twenty-two percentage points. Among the electorate at large, Clinton’s favorable rating has fallen well below fifty per cent. But among the Democratic electorate, seventy-one per cent of voters have a favorable view of the former Secretary of State, and just seventeen per cent have an unfavorable view.","2584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Seeking to solidify her position and change the post-Labor Day media narrative, Clinton on Tuesday apologized for setting up her own e-mail server, telling ABC News’s David Muir, “That was a mistake. I’m sorry about that. I take responsibility.” It remains to be seen what impact, if any, this statement will have on the polls, but many of Clinton’s supporters will welcome the interview as a step in the right direction. “As long as the email mess doesn’t sink her, Clinton could lose both heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, and still have a fairly unobstructed path to the nomination because of her mighty position with women and minorities,” Sabato and his colleagues wrote on Politico. “This is true even if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race.”","2585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"I’m not sure whether that final assertion takes account of the possibility of Biden jumping into the race with Elizabeth Warren as his running mate. Last week, a Boston Globe reporter asked Warren whether she and Biden had discussed this possibility during a recent meeting at the Vice-President’s residence.

It’s well known that the Bush campaign has been spending heavily, and there have been persistent rumors that, with the candidate trailing badly in the polls, its fund-raising efforts had stalled. Evidently, these rumors were accurate. Seeking to put a positive spin on things, the Bush campaign portrayed the cost-cutting as an effort to play the long game and direct resources toward the early primary states—Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. “This is about winning the race,” a Bush adviser told Bloomberg Politics. “We’re doing it now and making the shifts with confidence. We expect to win.”","2590","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"

A new poll from Iowa, which was released on Thursday, showed the former Florida governor garnering just five per cent of the votes among likely Republican voters. Perhaps the poll, from Quinnipiac University, was an outlier? No, it wasn’t. On Friday, another Iowa survey, this one carried out by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics, also showed Bush at just five per cent. “By any honest analysis, the first ten months of this year have been a political disaster,” a senior Republican told the Times, adding that it was “an unbelievable position to be twisted into, from ‘shock and awe’ to ‘aw, shucks.’ ”","2591","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"

"The obvious answer is that Bush has had Donald Trump to deal with, and Clinton hasn’t. In virtually monopolizing media coverage and subjecting Bush to months of public criticism, the New York billionaire has transformed the dynamics of the G.O.P. race in a way that almost nobody anticipated—a point the managers of the Bush campaign acknowledged in an internal memo announcing the cost cuts. “We would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the G.O.P. primary,” the memo said.","2593","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"

According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, he’s also running behind Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, and nationwide he has the support of just 7.2 per cent of likely Republican voters. For a candidate whose main selling point was supposed to be his electability, these are terrible numbers.

"In part, Bush’s weak numbers reflect the fact he has run a weak campaign—one dogged by his tendency to mangle the English language, or, at least, to use it carelessly. In his first big speech, back in February, he confused Iran with Iraq and got mixed up about how many fighters the Islamic State has. Since then, the list of phrases he has been forced to clarify or disavow is long and embarrassing: “People need to work longer hours”; “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars on women’s health-care issues”; “anchor babies”; “stuff happens.” On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Bush simply isn’t a good communicator. Indeed, he often appears to be a terrible one. Asked on Saturday whether his campaign’s cost-cutting showed it was in crisis, he said, “Blah, blah, blah. That’s my answer: blah, blah, blah.”","2595","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"

His tax-cutting economic plan, which he claims will increase G.D.P. growth to four per cent a year, is largely based on wishful thinking. His foreign-policy speeches are so vague that they’re hard to evaluate. On social issues, such as guns and abortion, he has said little to distinguish himself from the G.O.P. pack. In 2000, his brother George ran on the platform of “compassionate Conservatism,” which was his way of distinguishing himself from Newt Gingrich and other Republican bomb throwers.

None of the things she has proposed is particularly radical, but taken together they amount to a concerted effort to tackle wage stagnation and boost the middle class.","2597","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"

"The first is that Republican voters want a shift to the center. The one area where Bush has issued a proposal that separates him from other Republican candidates is immigration. To his credit, he has stuck to the position that law-abiding undocumented immigrants should be given the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. About all that has done is win him the enmity of conservative pundits and talk-show hosts, who accuse him of promoting an “amnesty.” On this issue, most Republican voters agree with Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Polls consistently show that a majority favor the mass deportation of undocumented aliens—an issue Trump has built his candidacy on.","2599","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The second shaky premise is the notion that Republicans are keen on restoring the Bush dynasty. From the beginning, this seemed like a dubious proposition: never in its history has America had three Presidents from the same family. When Jeb entered the race, G.O.P. supporters were being asked to embrace the possibility of three Bush Presidents in thirty years.","2600","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In its eagerness to promote someone it considered electable, the G.O.P. establishment sought to play down the dynastic aspect of Bush’s candidacy, portraying Jeb as very different from his elder brother: more thoughtful, more conservative, more articulate. Despite these efforts, no groundswell of support emerged for a Bush restoration. Indeed, it now appears that Barbara Bush, Jeb’s mother, spoke for many Republicans when she said, in April, 2013, “There are other people out there that are very qualified, and we’ve had enough Bushes.”","2601","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The Clinton campaign raises dynastic issues of its own, but there are important differences. As evidenced by the Adams, the Harrisons, and the Roosevelts, the idea of having two Presidents from the same family isn’t alien to the American tradition (even though the Roosevelts were only fifth cousins). And, in serving as a U.S. senator and as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has established credentials independent of her husband’s time in office. At the same time, it’s also important to note that Bill Clinton’s Presidency is far more popular among Democrats than George W. Bush’s Presidency is among Republicans. Some left-leaning Democrats may regard Bill Clinton’s Administration as a neo-liberal sellout, but most associate it with peace, prosperity, and the ability to outlast Republican attacks.","2602","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Even among Republicans, the last Bush Presidency inspires few fond feelings. It ended with the economy in recession, and with the U.S. military trapped in two costly and unwinnable-seeming wars. For a time, Jeb and his establishment backers pretended they could sustain a 2016 campaign that ignored this toxic legacy, but, once Trump entered the race, the strategy proved unsustainable. In portraying the Iraq war as a disaster and repeatedly tying Jeb to his elder brother, Trump forced Republicans to confront the question of why anybody would think that putting another Bush in the White House was a good idea.","2603","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"There are still more than three months to go before the G.O.P. Iowa caucus, but, if Bush is going to reëmerge as the front-runner, he’ll have to do a much better job of answering Trump’s charges. He’ll get his first opportunity this week, at the Republican debate in Boulder, Colorado. When the pressure was on these past two weeks, at the first Democratic debate and then at the Benghazi hearing, Clinton rose to the occasion and gave her campaign a huge boost. Now it’s Bush’s turn. “Jeb really needs a knockout performance—it needs to be all him, with nobody even close,” a New Hampshire Republican told Politico. “Otherwise those fumes he’s on are going to evaporate even quicker.”","2604","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"

"When Vice-President Joe Biden arrived to tape “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” on Thursday, it had the makings of an ordinary, slightly decorous affair. Two nights earlier, the guest, Jeb Bush, had put in a serviceable performance: hands clasped, a look on his face that was only slightly terrified. Bush didn’t know how Colbert would play it, so Bush maintained the wary, affable bearing of a dad plucked from the audience to go onstage at a magic show.","September 11, 2015","2628","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"But with Biden Colbert wasn’t going for laughs. Biden, of course, has been grieving for his son, Beau, who died on May 30th of brain cancer, while discussing, with more openness than most politicians, the emotional costs of a potential run for President. Colbert asked Biden how he kept a “soul” in Washington, and Biden replied with an old line about Amtrak—“I commuted every day for thirty-six years”—before turning serious. He admitted that the culture of falsity in D.C. baffled him. He wondered “why in the world would you want the job if you couldn’t say what you believe.” Colbert offered condolences, and asked him for a story about Beau. “I never once—my word as a Biden—never ever heard my child complain.” He recalled a conversation shortly before Beau died, when Beau said, “Dad, I know how much you love me. Promise me you’re going to be all right.”","2629","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Biden was looking down, eyes wet, staring at his hands, kneading them. He went on, “I don’t know what it was about him. He had this enormous sense of empathy. I’m not making this up. I know I sound like a father.”","2630","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"In 1972, Biden’s first wife, and their daughter, were killed in a car accident. Colbert, a fellow Catholic, asked Biden how his faith had helped him, and Biden might’ve been tempted to draw a gentle distinction between himself and politicians who wield their faith like a weapon. (Earlier that day, Bobby Jindal, a low-polling governor of Louisiana, had said, “It’s clear Donald Trump has never read the Bible.”) Of his own faith, Biden said, “I go to Mass, and I’m able to be just alone. Even in a crowd, you’re alone.” These days, he said, his wife, Jill, sometimes sticks notes on his bathroom mirror to read while he shaves; not long ago, she put up a quote from Kierkegaard: “Faith sees best in the dark.” He said, “The faith doesn’t always stay with you.”","2631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Biden looked down again, elsewhere for a moment. He patted one hand with the other, and looked up at Colbert, eyebrows raised, as if seeing him for the first time. Colbert was asking a question about “what lessons would you give other people,” and Biden mentioned, as always, an expression from his mother: “As long as you are alive you have an obligation to strive, and you’re not dead until you see the face of God.”","2632","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"He marvelled at people who have suffered and “don’t have anything like the support I had.” Then he leaned into Colbert, and said, “I’m not going to embarrass you, but you’re one of them, old buddy.” For a moment, Colbert looked genuinely stumped; he smiled, closed his eyes. When Colbert was ten, his father and two brothers were killed in a plane crash. Biden went on, “Losing your dad when you’re a kid . . . It’s like asking what made your mother do it every day? How did she get up every single day?”","2633","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Colbert interjected, “She had to take care of me.”","2634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Not immune to an opportunity, Biden grinned and said, “I imagine that would be a hell of a job.”","2635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Colbert continued, “After Dad and the boys died, she was emotionally completely shattered.”","2636","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"The show went to a commercial, and when they came back, the audience was chanting, “Joe! Joe! Joe!”","2637","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"He loved it. “Be careful what you wish for,” he said.","2638","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Eventually, Colbert got around to asking about the campaign, recalling that Biden had said recently that he wasn’t sure if he is “emotionally prepared” to run for President. Biden looked up at the klieg lights and gave a jut of the chin. “Look, I don’t think any man or woman should run for President unless, No. 1, they know exactly why they would want to be President. And, No. 2, they can look at folks out there and say, ‘I promise you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this.’ And, and, I’d be lying if I said that I knew I was there. I’m being completely honest. But nobody has a right in my view to seek that office unless they are willing to give it a hundred and ten per cent of who they are.”","2639","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Biden circled back to Beau. The Vice-President said that he was recently meeting troops and their families, in Denver. “It was going great,” Biden said. “And then a guy in the back yells, ‘Major Beau Biden! Bronze star, sir! Served with him in Iraq.’ And all of a sudden, I lost it.” Biden smiled—a grateful but haunted smile. “How can you—That’s not—I shouldn’t be saying this.” He trailed off.","2640","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"The eighteen minutes that Joe Biden spoke with Stephen Colbert produced the most public and painful demonstration of emotional honesty by any politician in months, if not years. Biden could never speak in a campaign quite the way that he spoke on Colbert. But a version of that would be powerful, and it was impossible not to see, in the Biden interview, a rebuttal to Trump’s moment in America—to the notion of self-promotion as success, of cruelty as candor, of empathy as weakness. Biden is no naïf; after a half-century in politics, he knew that he was doing well on that stage, and one suspects that he also knows the delicate risks inherent in seeking to convert deep good will into political capital.","2641","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"The familiar reasons why Biden would be a long-shot candidate remain what they were a week ago. Most importantly, a candidate is never more popular than on the day before he announces. But, already, the 2016 campaign has upturned expectations about what the political class thought Americans want most. Hillary Clinton is confronting more than a strategic deficit. (A Times headline this week: “Hillary Clinton to Show More Humor and Heart, Aides Say.”) If Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump can excite voters by simply suggesting the presence of candor, real or imagined, what would be the reaction to a candidate who doesn’t need to strain to say what he believes?","2642","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"On Thursday, Judge Richard M. Berman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a ruling vacating the N.F.L.’s four-game suspension of the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. The N.F.L. will appeal the decision, but will not seek a stay to keep Brady off the field, meaning that he will start in the Patriots opening game next week against the Steelers. Gronk is pleased. Massachusetts billboards are already rejoicing. Judge Berman will surely drink for free the next time he’s in Boston.","September 3, 2015","2643","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/tom-brady-wins-the-long-game"
"As Deflategate stretched on for months, people began offering Tom Brady two types of unsolicited advice. On one side were those—call them the concerned moralists—who implored Brady to come clean, and to admit some kind of culpability in the alleged scheme to let air out of footballs prior to the Patriots’ playoff game in January against the Indianapolis Colts. In May, Brady was accused, based on an investigation commissioned by the N.F.L., of being “at least generally aware of the inappropriate activities … involving the release of air from Patriots game balls.” A week or so later, the N.F.L. announced that Brady would be suspended for the first four games of the upcoming season. All this, combined with conflicting and often erroneous initial news reports on the condition of the footballs in question, as well as Brady’s muddled denials of any involvement, had left many people convinced not only that Patriots equipment managers had tampered with the balls but that Brady knew about it, and that this had compromised the integrity of the game and his place in its history. Some argued that Brady shouldn’t even bother to appeal the decision, but instead apologize, take the punishment, and seek forgiveness. When Brady, represented by the players’ union, lost his appeal, in a hearing in front of N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, in July, they said he shouldn’t take the case to court but drop it, and let everyone move forward.","2644","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/tom-brady-wins-the-long-game"
"On the other side were people, who surely feel pretty smart today, who told Brady that he should give up any attempt to manage the public-relations aspect of Deflategate and, like a good American, vigorously pursue each and every procedural and legal recourse available to him. In May, after Brady was suspended, Donald Trump, just a civilian blowhard at the time, said that Brady should “sue the hell out of the N.F.L.” (On Thursday, Trump the Presidential candidate called Brady “my friend and a total winner!”) The former N.F.L. linebacker Jonathan Vilma—who had been suspended by Goodell in connection with the Saints Bountygate scandal, in 2012, only to have his suspension overturned on appeal—was more precise. “I’d tell Brady to fight the emotion of defending himself publicly, lawyer up, and begin to devise a game plan to beat the N.F.L. through the [court] system,” Vilma said. That’s exactly what Brady and the players’ union did, and in the process Brady not only won the right to play—for now—but also struck another blow against the N.F.L.’s player-discipline procedures, as managed by Goodell.","2645","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/tom-brady-wins-the-long-game"
"What’s more, Brady managed, by prolonging Deflategate, to rather unexpectedly rehabilitate his image. The longer it stayed in the news, the more ridiculous the entire scandal began to seem. The more the evidence from the N.F.L.’s investigation was parsed in print and on talk radio, the more flimsy and bizarre it appeared. And the longer that the N.F.L.’s clumsy handling of the case was put on display, the more that people began to turn against the league and its commissioner. Even before Thursday’s ruling, the seemingly impossible had happened: people from places other than New England and San Mateo, California, had begun, begrudgingly, to root for Tom Brady.","2646","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/tom-brady-wins-the-long-game"
"In his ruling, Judge Berman offered no comment on the particular charges levelled against Brady or the Patriots. As time passes and perhaps new information surfaces, Deflategate, as it relates to actual footballs, will continue to be a point of debate—a taunt from Pats haters, and another chip on the shoulder for New England’s faithful. But Berman ruled clearly that the appeal process offered by the league suffered “several significant legal deficiencies.”","2647","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/tom-brady-wins-the-long-game"
"Berman wrote that “Brady had no notice that he could receive a four-game suspension for general awareness of ball deflation by others or participation in any scheme to deflate footballs, and noncooperation with the ensuing investigation.” The N.F.L., he found, had failed to provide “the opportunity for Brady to examine one of two lead investigators” or “access to investigative files, including witness interview notes.” Berman said, in effect, that the N.F.L.’s punishment guidelines were unclear, and that its appeals process wasn’t fair and didn’t work. This marks the third case in a row, following recent high-profile challenges involving Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson, in which a suspension issued by Goodell has been overturned in court. Today, the players’ association issued a statement that said, “This decision should prove, once and for all, that our Collective Bargaining Agreement does not grant this Commissioner the authority to be unfair, arbitrary and misleading.”","2648","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/tom-brady-wins-the-long-game"
"The process—one in which Roger Goodell imposes the punishments, hears the appeals, and sets the terms of those hearings—clearly needs to be revamped, both in the interests of the players, who deserve fairer treatment, and of the league, which, from time to time, needs to impose punishments that can withstand at least the most basic kind of scrutiny. Beyond that, the N.F.L.’s loss offers an opportunity to rethink the role of the commissioner position more generally. In the past few years, Goodell has given himself over fully to the task of investigating and punishing players, turning his office into a kind of private courtroom in which he occupies several roles at once. This was a response, in part, to violent off-the-field incidents that have left fans shocked and disgusted. But Goodell has embraced his role as cop and prosecutor with a kind of haphazard glee, and his decisions keep getting overturned. The N.F.L. needs to decide if it wants to continue operating its own in-house legal system, and, if so, who should run it.","2649","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/tom-brady-wins-the-long-game"
"This week, before the suspension was vacated, Brady said, sarcastically, “Yeah, it’s been such an enjoyable off-season.” Now, as the regular season begins, it’s Goodell who has become Deflategate’s new, unhappy star.","2650","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/tom-brady-wins-the-long-game"
"Politico has posted a fifty-one-second compilation video of what it calls “unfortunate comments” by Jeb Bush—“stuff happens,” “free stuff,” “anchor babies,” “I’m not sure we need to spend half a billion dollars for women’s-health issues,” and so on. The implication is that it’s a mystery why a sixty-two-year-old third-generation politician, the grandson of a senator and the son and brother of Presidents (his own son George P. Bush, an office-holder in Texas, is fourth-generation), would be capable of making stupid mistakes in a campaign that he has to have been thinking about for decades.","October 7, 2015","2651","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"All of the unfortunate comments are presumably impolitic, but all of them also seem to reveal what Bush really thinks: mass shootings ought not give rise to gun-control legislation, government payments engender dependency, illegal immigrants have babies so that they can stay in the United States, women’s-health issues (especially birth control!) should not be government’s responsibility. Bush, as an insider, is supposed to know better than to be this candid, especially when he is confronted with the difficult task of persuading a very conservative Republican primary electorate to trust him, while in full view, via the press, of the much more liberal general electorate. Candor is for people like Donald Trump.","2652","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Jeb Bush seems to be, to descend into New Age lingo, a left-brain politician: rational to a fault. George W. Bush was right-brain: instinctive. Left-brain politicians think about policy. Right-brain politicians think about politics, and about how to connect with people. George W.’s description of himself, in the 2000 campaign, as a “compassionate conservative” was brilliantly vague—liberals heard it as “I’m not all that conservative,” and conservatives heard it as “I’m deeply religious.” It was about him as a person, not a program. Jeb’s slogan, “Right to rise,” is harder-edged, more specific in its implications, less personal, and easier to attack.","2653","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Jeb Bush has said that he is the most ideologically conservative member of his family, and he’s also known for being fascinated by the details of government. His brother preferred to have issues boiled down into very short memos. He prided himself on decisiveness, not knowledge or intellectual consistency.","2654","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"It may not be so easy for liberals in 2015 to understand why many conservatives regard George W. as a sellout. His sins, in conservatives’ view, included getting the federal government much more involved with local public schools through No Child Left Behind, creating a very expensive new entitlement program in the prescription-drug benefit for senior citizens, and going to war for reasons beyond an immediate need to protect the homeland.","2655","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Jeb, compared to his brother, seems much more sincerely devoted to the great theoretical cause of American conservatism, limited government. You can sense his impulse to turn each news event to which he must respond into a teachable moment about how government isn’t the solution to every problem. No less than liberals, conservatives feel themselves to be perpetual underdogs, because the other side’s main selling point, the provision of government benefits to people, is far more immediately appealing. Conservatives see themselves as having the challenge of arguing that you really shouldn’t want the goodies the Democrats are offering you. That’s the place where Bush’s unfortunate comment about taking care of you with free stuff seems to come from.","2656","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"For a very long time, Presidential politics have been stuck in a dynamic in which Republicans attack “government” without getting too specific about which of the government’s activities they have in mind, and Democrats defend popular programs but not the over-all idea of the welfare state. Bill Clinton’s typically centrist attempt to address the larger issue was to say, in his second inaugural address, that government was not the problem but neither was it the solution. Who can argue with that?","2657","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Anyone who has found this situation frustrating ought to be happy with the way this campaign season is going. The legacy of the financial crisis and the rise of Bernie Sanders have pushed Hillary Clinton to be more open about offering government as a corrective to the excesses of the market than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama has generally been.

"There was a time—how often has this sentence been written?—when the Republican Party stood for certain ideas, even if they sometimes contradicted each other: for instance, antipathy toward high marginal tax rates and a belief in balanced budgets. On issues involving national security and economic emergencies, many were willing to entertain, and even seek, coöperation from Democrats, as happened after the financial collapse of 2008. It was the approach taken by our postwar (or post-New Deal) Republican Presidents, up to and including George W. Bush, even if the party went through occasional ideological swerves, as when it nominated the sometimes alarming conservative Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, in 1964. But the real live-and-let-live Goldwater, popular with his Senate colleagues, never fully fit his scary image.","October 1, 2015","2660","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"The emergence of the Republican Class of ’16 may be changing the shape of historic Republicanism once and for all. Part of it stems from the “outsiders”—Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina, who have never held elective office and probably never will. But no one better embodies this change than the freshman Texas senator Ted Cruz, who seems unable to stop talking, although the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, recently outsmarted him, as Politico’s Burgess Everett put it, by effectively putting him in party “quarantine.” (McConnell, like past Senate leaders such as Howard Baker and Bob Dole, has the job here of representing the sanity wing of the party.) Cruz, though, knows where to find receptive audiences, as when he recently spoke to the conservative religious Values Voter Summit, in Washington, and went on to win the group’s straw poll, for the third year in a row. (Cruz got thirty-five per cent, followed by Carson, at eighteen per cent, and Mike Huckabee, the perennial champion of his own values, at fourteen per cent.)","2661","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz still surprises. Just when you think he can’t go any further, he goes further. Considering the venue, you can understand why he got an appreciative laugh at the “Values” meeting when he mentioned Xi Jinping’s meeting with President Obama and said, “Media all across the world are reporting on this historic meeting of the world’s most powerful Communist, and the President of China.” (Drum roll.) But his ear has difficulty recognizing the proper key. A few days after Vice-President Joe Biden’s son Beau died, of a brain tumor, Cruz was having his fun: “Joe Biden … You know what the nice thing is? You don’t even need a punch line. I promise you, it works. At the next party you’re at, just walk up to someone and say, ‘Vice-President Joe Biden,’ and just close your mouth. They will crack up laughing.” That wasn’t nearly as funny as the Obama-is-a-big-Communist gag, and perhaps that’s why Cruz offered an apology.","2662","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"On foreign policy, Cruz is even less funny, as when he dilated on the Iran nuclear deal: “If you vote for me, under no circumstances will a nation led by a theocratic Ayatollah, who chants ‘Death to America,’ under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.” So far, that is pretty much what Obama says. Cruz, though, added, “If the Ayatollah doesn’t understand that, we may have to introduce him to his seventy-two virgins,” which sounded very much like a threat to murder Iran’s Supreme Leader. Cruz did not approve of recent Supreme Court decisions that upheld the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage. His solution, as he told Steve Inskeep, of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” is a constitutional amendment—“one that would make members of the Supreme Court subject to periodic judicial retention elections … [so that] if judges overstep their bounds, violate the Constitution, then the people have a check to remove them from office.” This was an attack on a branch of government far more radical than Franklin D. Roosevelt’s infamous “court packing” scheme, in 1937, to add as many as six members when Justices reached age seventy and didn’t retire.","2663","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Sounding mean-spirited and over the top is nothing new in American politics. Senator Joseph McCarthy, to whom Cruz bears a slight physical resemblance (it’s the eyebrows), made use of the Red Scare to attack Democrats. McCarthy, like Louisiana’s Huey Long, belonged to a subcategory of demagogic, disruptive senators, a role that suits Cruz perfectly. McCarthy never ran for President.","2664","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"
"Cruz’s thoughts and language bring to mind the 1993 American Scholar essay “Defining Deviancy Down,” by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (though not Moynihan himself). In it, Moynihan writes, “I proffer the thesis that, over the past generation … the amount of deviant behavior in American society has increased beyond the levels the community can ‘afford to recognize’ and that, accordingly, we have been re-defining deviancy so as to exempt much conduct previously stigmatized, and also quietly raising the ‘normal’ level in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard.” Moynihan was writing about crime and antisocial behavior in general, but the change in standards might just as well apply to politics. That someone like Ted Cruz is running for President, and taken seriously—that nearly sixty per cent of Republicans now support, in aggregate, Trump, Fiorina, Carson, and Cruz—suggests that the modern Republican Party is close to “defining politics down.” With more than a year to go before the next Presidential election, Cruz may be posing the essential question: “How far down?”","2665","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-ted-cruz-defining-politics-down"

"On Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton went on the “The Tonight Show” to talk about, well, mostly Donald Trump. She first appeared in a skit in which the host, Jimmy Fallon, dressed as Trump, called her on the phone to catch up, offer campaign advice, and provide a set-up for her to discuss the many ways that she has fought for women’s rights throughout her long career in public service. Later, during the interview portion of her appearance, she and Fallon joked about Trump’s hair (she invited Fallon to touch hers) and mocked his stream-of-consciousness speaking style.","September 17, 2015","2693","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Noting that Trump and other Republican candidates have never held political office, Fallon asked Clinton, “Is this possible, that you have too much experience to become the President of the United States?” The questions did not get harder hitting from there. Are you tough enough to be President? How did you figure out how to use Twitter? Fallon tried to ask Clinton about the ongoing scandal involving the e-mails she sent as Secretary of State, but she parried the question by joking about gefilte fish, then offered a vague explanation about how various governmental agencies interact. Fallon, nodding, was ready to move on.","2694","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"

"It could have been different. Clinton was reportedly offered a spot on Colbert’s first show, which aired last week, but her campaign team turned it down. (Perhaps they were worried that he would ask a coherent question about the e-mails; he probably would have.) So the invitation went to Jeb Bush, who, during an oddly paced conversation, earned from Colbert some lukewarm and circuitous praise. “There is a nonzero chance that I would consider voting for you,” Colbert said, causing Bush to pause for a moment, taken aback, perhaps thinking that the host had said “a zero chance.” But such scorn from Colbert was instead reserved for Trump, who is, despite the host’s antipathy, appearing on “The Late Show” next week, a day after Ted Cruz. Before that, on Friday, it will be Bernie Sanders, who earlier this summer went on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” There, Meyers began the interview by making fun of Sanders’s hair, but then, remembering perhaps that he is supposed to be the intelligent late-night alternative (or is that Colbert now?), led a substantive conversation about economic inequality.","2696","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"All of the candidates—including those among the herd of Republicans in the race, some of whom have started their own late-night tours—have the misfortune of campaigning to replace an all-star yakker, Barack Obama, who looks more comfortable on talk-show sets than at least half of the guys (yes, still all guys) currently behind the desks. In 2009, he became the first sitting President to appear on a late-night show, when he visited the “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.” This summer, he offered quasi-official Presidential goodbyes to the departing David Letterman and Jon Stewart. The 2016 candidates aren’t just running for President, but auditioning for the role of Guest-in-Chief.","2697","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"And this campaign arrives at a time when the hosts, too, are jockeying for position in a crowded field. Some see the booking scramble as a new iteration of the late-night wars, with Fallon and Colbert reëstablishing the old Leno-Letterman dynamic, in which Fallon, like Leno, wins the ratings, but Colbert, as was true of David Letterman, enjoys more cultural cachet. (This interpretation relegates “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to third-party status, and the others to the further fringe.)","2698","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"The emerging conventional wisdom suggests that if you want to behave like a grown-up, you’ll go on Colbert’s show, and if you want to make a dent on social media, you’ll go to Fallon and make yourself look gently ridiculous in exchange for a little viral gold dust. But, for politicians, it hasn’t worked out that way so far. Last week, Trump chose Fallon and faced off against the genial host’s Trump impression. (He seemed pleased at what he saw.) When Fallon asked him how he would create new jobs as President, Trump replied, “I’m just going to do it.” (Same thing with the border wall.) At the end of the bit, Trump blew Fallon a kiss. The exchange did not make waves.","2699","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Trump might have made more of a splash on Jimmy Kimmel’s show, which, like Fallon’s, produces reliably shareable moments, but with a touch more vinegar thrown in. Watching Trump read mean tweets about himself could have been fun for all. Then again, the invitation might not be forthcoming: Kimmel doesn’t seem to like Trump much. (An even better, but sadly impossible, match for Trump: the short-lived but sensation-making “Morton Downey Jr. Show,” which ran for a couple years in the late nineteen-eighties, and where Trump could have traded insults with the vituperative host, mocked his fellow-guests, and basked in the madhouse frenzy stirred up by the braying audience.)","2700","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Remarkably, the most viral late-night moment for any politician during this cycle was a long, wide-ranging conversation about authenticity and grief. When Vice-President Joe Biden went on Colbert last week, they talked about how religious faith has shaped the way that they both have faced personal tragedy, and the discussion was raw and unsettling and poignant. No one quite knew how to put this politely, but it was political gold. Colbert, visibly moved, more or less demanded that Biden run for President—if he does, these several minutes on television will be cited, rightly or wrongly, as a turning point. They were also a reminder that Internet virality is not always a reflection of our most shallow selves. Sometimes people share things for the simple reason that they mean a great deal.","2701","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Watching Clinton on Fallon, Wednesday night, I was reminded of just how many times Clinton has, while running for office, strained to come across as an ordinary person. No amount of self-deprecating quips about dyeing her hair or wearing pantsuits, or jokes about being a kooky grandma, will make the case. She is not ordinary, but rather an exceptional person with an exceptionally complicated public history. That doesn’t mean that she can’t connect with people, though, even in the constricting genre of late-night TV. She was always funny on Letterman, but during an appearance in 2003 she was more than that, talking about how she felt in the days after her husband admitted to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky. She was there to promote her book, but everyone goes on late night for a reason. She had profound things to say about marriage, pain, and forgiveness. Viewers have come to expect a politician’s appearance on a talk show to be frivolous and opportunistic. When it is more than that, they are surprised and sometimes even moved.

"To cut unceremoniously to the chase, yes, as you might suspect, or fear, Garth Risk Hallberg’s new, much promoted, nine-hundred-and-forty-four-page novel, “City on Fire” (Knopf), is about four hundred pages too long. Hallberg is a gifted writer, so the pages go by pleasurably. His book is never flaccid or flat, but it does not leave you wishing for more. He tried to squeeze too much juice out of the apple.","2703","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"“City on Fire” is basically a detective story, from a recipe that goes back to Dickens: an apparently random event—in this case, the shooting of a punky N.Y.U. student named Samantha in Central Park on New Year’s Eve—turns out to be a thread that, when pulled, unravels a web of intrigue that stretches from a midtown office tower to an abandoned building in the East Village. The novel features a dozen or so characters from varied walks of New York life—a cop, a reporter, a schoolteacher, a punk rocker, a fireworks-maker, an assistant in a gallery, an investment banker, and so on. As the secrets are revealed, each of them turns out to be one degree of separation or less from the others.","2704","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"It’s all highly implausible, of course. Contrary to what newcomers to the city may imagine, New York is a place where circles almost never intersect, except transactionally—at co-op meetings and parent-teacher conferences, or on jury duty. New Yorkers circulate mostly within their own class and occupational orbits. Manhattan is a hundred small towns unevenly distributed over some twenty-two square miles of city space.","2705","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"But the genre that “City on Fire” belongs to requires a suspension of disbelief on this point. Implausibility is part of the design. The plots of Dickens’s big “condition of England” novels are implausible in the same way. In the London of “Bleak House,” a connection between Lady Dedlock and Jo the street-sweeper didn’t have even a transactional basis. The aim of these novels is not to mimic actual city life, where people tend to be like hamsters in their own cages. It’s to dramatize a hidden interdependence, to show that we are all, each according to our abilities, turning the same big socioeconomic wheel inside the same spatiotemporal cage.","2706","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"The spatiotemporal cage in “City on Fire” is New York in the nineteen-seventies. The main action takes us from Christmas, 1976, to July 13, 1977, the night of the New York City blackout. (The night, to be precise, of the second New York City blackout; the first was in 1965. A third blackout happened in 2003.) The book opens with a bang. The setup, introducing the main characters and ending with the shooting and the start of the police investigation, is expertly handled on every level: characterization, setting, pace, suspense. It takes up only a hundred and thirty-one pages.","2707","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"Then the backstories start. There are also flash-forwards, plus several “interludes,” consisting of documents printed in a variety of fonts (a New Wave zine, the typescript of a magazine piece, an artist’s notebook). In all, the novel has six of these interludes, ninety-four chapters, a prologue, and a postscript. Relationships get reshuffled and a lot of family history accumulates, but the book has just the one plot. The style is naturalistic—no Pynchonian flights of fancy—with some bravura passages (inside the mind of someone on heroin, for instance) and bits of life wisdom appropriate to the characters’ personalities and perspectives.","2708","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"It’s rude to speculate about an author’s motives, so let’s just say it’s as though Hallberg had had an idea for a great, “Chinatown”-like whodunit about New York but felt some sort of ethical or professional duty to turn the book into an art novel. (In fact, although “City on Fire” is being advertised as Hallberg’s first novel, he has published an art novel, “A Field Guide to the North American Family,” a cross-indexed mixture of prose and photographs.) Hallberg has the talent to bring a character to life in a few pages, and that’s really all he needs for the purposes of his plot. The backstories and the rest iterate more than they complicate.","2709","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"Another reason for the length is an overreliance on the technique known as free indirect style—the focalization of the narrative through the mind and voice of a character. It’s a great device for representing experience from the inside, but it carves the world into a series of perspectives. Here is the first paragraph of the first chapter:","2710","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"It’s a nicely crafted curtain-raiser. It signals a time (the de-institutionalized homeless—the “bedlamites”—began showing up on the streets in 1965; the WALK/DON’T WALK signs got phased out starting in 2000) and a place (Eleventh Avenue loading docks plus prostitutes equals Hell’s Kitchen), and it introduces two major characters. Mercer is a nerdy African-American from Georgia who teaches in a private school for girls in the Village, loves nineteenth-century novels like “Lost Illusions” and “The Red and the Black,” and is trying to write a novel of his own (not, as it turns out, this one). His boyfriend, William, is the estranged scion of a banking family, an ex-punk-band leader, public-restroom cruiser, and heroin addict. He is trying to finish a painting.","2711","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"But the “lens” on the encounter in a crosswalk between a Christmas tree and an empty shopping cart (a tidy image of economic dissonance) is Mercer. Everything in the scene is as he sees it and thinks it. “Bedlamite,” an obsolete Britishism, is there because it’s a word that a literary guy like Mercer would know. Even the description of Mercer is Mercer’s description. Every chapter is in this mode. We get the picture from one point of view at a time. There are few wide-angle shots.

"It’s not the facts that bring the nineteen-seventies to life in “City on Fire.” What Hallberg is after is an atmosphere, and he gets it. He gets the assaultive feeling the city had in those bombed-out years. He gets the ubiquitous defacement of public surfaces, the shuttered shops and derelict street people, the soul-destroying round-the-clock noise.

"But he is (like Dickens) a romantic about human nature. “City on Fire” will probably be compared with Tom Wolfe’s big, class-intersecting novel about New York in the nineteen-eighties, “The Bonfire of the Vanities.” You read it here first that this would be a mistake. “The Bonfire of the Vanities,” as the allusion to Thackeray tells us, is a satire. “City on Fire” is not remotely satirical. The good guys are truly good, or, at least, they have honorable intentions and suffer remorse when they fall short. The few characters who are without a conscience had tough childhoods. The system is not to blame, it seems, nor is human folly. It’s just that some people manage to transcend their family mess (every family in the novel is some sort of mess), and some can’t, in which case they might deal with their pain by doing bad things, like burning down the South Bronx.","2717","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"Hallberg is also a romantic about the nineteen-seventies. That may seem a strange species of nostalgia. The decade between 1972 and 1982 was the worst extended economic period since the nineteen-thirties. There were two oil crises, the first in 1973, when the price of a barrel nearly quadrupled, and the second in 1978-79, when it tripled. The stock market crashed in grim slow motion. Between 1972 and 1974, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost almost half its value, and the market did not get back to 1972 levels until 1982. In 1975, unemployment jumped to 8.5 per cent. The inflation rate exceeded ten per cent. By late 1980, the year Ronald Reagan was elected President, the prime rate was twenty per cent.","2718","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"In New York, it was the same only worse. From 1970 to 1976, the city lost more than six hundred thousand jobs. By 1976, unemployment stood at eleven per cent, and one in every seven New Yorkers was on welfare. The city was broke and had to be bailed out. “Ford to City: Drop Dead” was the famous Daily News headline, but Ford did not in fact say those words, and Congress eventually provided the financial assistance the city needed to climb back out of the red.","2719","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"The price for that aid was austerity measures, and the reduction in city services, as well as poor decisions about things like the allocation of firehouses, led to areas of the city, like the Lower East Side and the South Bronx, becoming wastelands of drugs, abandoned buildings, muggings, robberies, and arson. Signs of blight were everywhere, a kind of urban eczema.","2720","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"New York felt empty—there were so many parts of it where people didn’t want to go—and out of control. It was the time of broken windows. But, in part because of the collapse, the city also felt open, liberated, available. Anything seemed possible, especially to people who didn’t have much to begin with—avant-garde artists and performers, New Wave musicians, experimental writers, advanced students of the society of the spectacle. It wasn’t quite Saint-Germain-des-Prés after 1945 or Berlin after 1989, but Manhattan in the nineteen-seventies had a kind of locally grown cultural magnetism.","2721","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"The piece of the downtown subculture that Hallberg takes on is the music scene. It was centered on two clubs, C.B.G.B., at Bowery and Bleecker, and the renovated Max’s Kansas City, on Park Avenue South. Those clubs were where groups like the Ramones, Television, and Blondie—groups at first known only by word of mouth—performed. It cost a dollar to see the Ramones at C.B.G.B. (You had to pay for drinks.)","2722","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"The main downtown characters in “City on Fire” are the members of a punk band called Ex Nihilo and assorted hangers-on. The most successful of these is Charlie, a geeky Long Island teen-ager who is making the difficult taste transition from David Bowie to Patti Smith. To the extent that “City on Fire” is a novel of education, like the nineteenth-century novels that Mercer is obsessed with, Charlie is the hero. As a detective story, though, the book has two main actors: the leader of Ex Nihilo, who uses the stage name Nicky Chaos, and his uptown counterpart, Amory Gould, a businessman who has a scheme to make money from urban blight and might require a little surreptitious help with the blight part.","2723","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"Nicky is a practitioner of the Situationist art of negation. He is a firebug who collects Herb Alpert records and talks about Marx and Nietzsche. He describes himself as a “post-Humanist,” and says things like “Choice isn’t the same thing as freedom—not when someone is framing the choices for you,” and, “This is the ’70s now, the death trip, the destruction trip, the internal contradictions rumbling and grumbling, the return of the repressed. It’s the system, having swallowed everything, having indigestion.”","2724","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"He also says, “No more art. No more trying to change the culture with culture.” He’s a revolutionary who thinks that people won’t rise up unless their lives get materially worse. Underlying his arrangement with Amory is a bet over whether increasing the blight will bring on class warfare or simply hasten redevelopment.","2725","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"The climax of the novel is set during the blackout. July 13, 1977, was a very hot day. At 8:37 p.m., during a thunderstorm, power lines in Westchester carrying electricity to the city’s grid were hit by lightning. Con Ed was unprepared to cope with the demand, there were more lightning strikes and a chain reaction, and by 9:36 p.m. all five boroughs (except for portions of Queens) and a few northern suburbs were without electricity.","2726","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"The looting and arson began almost immediately. It was twenty-five hours before power was restored, and by then a thousand serious fires had broken out, more than fifteen hundred businesses had been looted or set on fire, and thirty-seven hundred people had been arrested. Rioters did not touch upscale businesses on the Upper East Side or, for the most part, in midtown. They looted and burned the mom-and-pop stores and bodegas in their own neighborhoods. About half of those arrested were unemployed, but this meant that about half were not. It was a frenzy of self-destruction.","2727","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"Hallberg’s blackout is a (hundred-and-twenty-page) Walpurgisnacht of rage, craziness, and anarchy, but he also treats it as one of those suspensions of the conditions of ordinary life that allow things, under cover of chaos, to sort themselves out. By the next day, the mystery of the shooting has been solved and the web of intrigue revealed, and the dozen or so characters, having been brought together, now begin to separate, off to fresh treadmills in cages new.","2728","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"The rioting killed any Situationist dreams of a new Commune. As the writer Luc Sante, then a graduate student living on the Lower East Side, later put it, “The looters were exemplary Americans, whose immediate impulse in a crisis was to see to the acquisition of consumable goods. They had no interest in power. Neither did anyone I knew. We just wanted power to go away.” The blackout did not kill the arts scene, though. The damaging blow came in 1981, at the very end of that rough decade, with the first signs of the AIDS epidemic.","2729","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"It may strike some readers as a little odd to find that the novel’s sympathies seem to lie, ultimately, with the uptown businesspeople, and not with the punks. Amory was right: the recession may have driven many middle-class families out of the city, but it was a great business opportunity. One cause of the arson was landlords choosing to burn their buildings for the insurance. This meant that there was plenty of distressed property, all over the city, for bold speculators to snap up.","2730","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"That’s how Donald Trump got his start. In 1974, when he was twenty-eight and had never built a thing in Manhattan, he set out to acquire property owned by the bankrupt Penn Central railroad. One of those pieces was the Grand Commodore Hotel, on Forty-second Street, next to Grand Central. According to Trump’s account, in his first book, “The Art of the Deal” (required reading for those of us preparing for a Trump Presidency), he got the city to agree to let him pay taxes on the property based on its assessed value in 1975. Trump renovated the hotel, and, in 1980, it reopened as the Grand Hyatt. The tax abatement was good for forty years, and is estimated to have been worth sixty million dollars in its first decade.","2731","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"A great number of the jobs lost between 1970 and 1976 were manufacturing jobs. The city was going through a painful and inadequately planned-for transition from an economy based on manufacturing to one based on financial services. It needed the markets to recover, but, when they did, all the amenities of urban professional life recovered with them. Gentrification drove the S.R.O.s out and real-estate values up. The old Times Square, a squalid realm of peep shows and B movies, was turned into Disney World Manhattan.","2732","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"
"Upscale New Yorkers today may complain about the gentrification and the commodification and the tourists. But not many of those people would have lasted long in the city of 1975. They would have found it so unhealthy. People smoked in restaurants and did not clean up after their dogs. Forget about cell phones and Wi-Fi; most people didn’t even have cable. If you parked your car on the street, someone would steal the radio. There were no espresso bars in the nineteen-seventies, no Mario Batali or David Chang or Dan Barber. There was Chock full o’ Nuts, and people ate in places like Lüchow’s and Mama Leone’s, huge barns of fat and cholesterol. Gyms were for pumping iron, not for doing Pilates. No one had ever heard of Pilates.","2733","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-time-of-broken-windows"

"“President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America—it is nothing less than lunacy,” Ted Cruz said on Fox News, the day after the attacks on Paris. If there are Syrian Muslims who are really being persecuted, he said, they should be sent to “majority-Muslim countries.” Then he reset his eyebrows, which had been angled in a peak of concern, as if he had something pious to say. And he did: “On the other hand,” he added, “Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them. But President Obama refuses to do that.”","November 16, 2015","2735","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The next day, at a middle school in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Cruz spoke even more openly about those whom he considers to be the good people in the world. He told reporters that we should accept Christians from Syria, and only Christians, because, he said, “There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.” This will come as a profound surprise to the people of Oklahoma City and Charleston, to all parties in Ireland, and to the families of the teen-agers whom Anders Breivik killed in Norway, among many others. The Washington Post noted that Cruz “did not say how he would determine that refugees were Christian or Muslim.” Would he accept baptismal certificates, or notes from pastors? Does he just want to hear the refugees pray?","2736","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"On Monday, President Barack Obama reacted to this suggestion with some anger. “When I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims, when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who’s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefitted from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that’s shameful,” Obama said. (That last bit, about “families who’ve benefitted” when fleeing persecution, was an unmistakable reference to Cruz and Marco Rubio.) Obama continued, “That’s not who we are. We don’t have religious tests to our compassion.” The question is whether Obama can put that compassion to use, in this precipitous moment after Paris, when so many bad choices will seem appealing, including attacks on our fellow-citizens. (On Monday, Donald Trump said that, though he’d “hate to do it,” as President he would “seriously consider” closing mosques that were viewed as centers of radicalism.) The real criticism is that the United States has taken so few Syrian refugees of any religion—just about fifteen hundred, all of whom have been screened by a process that can take up to two years.","2737","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Cruz is cruder than some, but he is not alone among Republicans. On Sunday, Jeb Bush also said that, although he isn’t entirely opposed to helping refugees who’d been screened, “I think our focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore.” (Christians were ten per cent of Syria’s population when the civil war broke out.) On Monday morning, Bush spoke about how “we should focus on creating safe havens for refugees in Syria rather than bringing them all the way across the United States”—a life in no-fly zones, while, according to a vision Bush also laid out over the weekend, a major land war involving U.S. troops was launched around them. He quickly added, “But I do think there is a special, important need to make sure that Syrians are being protected, because they are being slaughtered in the country and, but for us, who—who would take care of the number of Christians that right now are completely displaced?” Others, like Rubio, have avoided the Christian question by saying that they don’t think we should take refugees at all. Ben Carson, speaking to Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday,” said that taking in refugees “from that area of the world, I think, is a huge mistake. … To bring them over here, under these circumstances, is a suspension of intellect,” and would ignore “the reason the human brain has these big frontal lobes, as opposed to other animals.” (He then talked at greater length about “brain stems.”) Trump, in the past, has claimed that Syrian Muslim refugees can get into America “easily” (they cannot), while “if you’re from Syria and you’re Christian you cannot come into this country” (again, not the case). But, mostly, Trump doesn’t want to let anybody in, at least not anybody of the tempest-tossed type. Indeed, it’s not clear that the talk of Christian refugees is meant, even by the loudest Republicans, to translate into the appearance of Syrian Christians in America, as opposed to being an acknowledgment that some of the crowds that cheer when they hear anti-immigrant rhetoric might have qualms of conscience. The problem, they can be told, is just that our Muslim-sympathizing, cowardly leaders would bring in the wrong refugees.","2738","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Christians are in danger in Syria. Their danger is distinct but not unique. The Yazidis, an even more isolated religious minority, have been a particular target of ISIS. Shiites and Alawites have been targeted, too. Refugee policies have at times rightly recognized the urgent danger that certain religious or otherwise distinct groups are in, and have properly responded. This is something quite different than saying, as Cruz does, that being a Muslim should be a basis for exclusion. Would he let in atheists, for that matter? It seems strange, when moderate Muslims are trying to distance themselves from a milieu of terror, that we would insist that such a thing is impossible. There are international and American laws that recognize people who need protection. There are principles of common decency which do the same. What they do not do is use faith, or the lack of it, as a basis for rejection. (America should have let in more Jewish refugees during the Second World War; that wouldn’t have meant turning away Thomas Mann.) And it is a brutal insult to Syrians who have gone through four and half years of carnage to say that the fact that they are Sunnis gives them some sort of immunity from ISIS or from the Assad regime. There are four million Syrian refugees outside of the country now, and many more inside it. There will likely be some bad people among them. That fact does not obviate their suffering. Taking more of them in can be an unpopular position at a moment when the news is full of speculation that one of the Paris attackers had passed through a refugee camp in Greece with a Syrian passport. But their desperation will not disappear if we lose interest in it; it may just take a different and more destructive form. We have a role in deciding where they will go next.","2739","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"One of the more dishonest aspects of Cruz’s comments on Fox was his characterization of who the Syrian refugees are. He mentioned an estimate that, in the “early waves” of refugees entering Europe, “seventy-seven per cent of those refugees were young men. That is a very odd demographic for a refugee wave.” Perhaps it would be, if the number were accurate. A bare majority of the Syrian refugees are women, as FactCheck.org noted in September, when Ben Carson and Scott Walker raised similar alarms. About twenty-two per cent are men between the ages of eighteen and fifty-nine—a broad definition of “young.” Cruz is smart enough to know this. He may be referring to a number given for migrants who arrived in Europe, from nine different countries, by taking a specific, dangerous Mediterranean sea route in 2014 (seventy-two per cent). Among the two million Syrian refugees the United Nations has registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon, a full thirty-eight per cent are under the age of twelve.","2740","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"For that matter, why shouldn’t there be young men among the refugees? In stories about why people emigrate, like the one told by Nicholas Schmidle last month in The New Yorker, one reason young men give as a motivating factor for leaving their countries is the fear of being conscripted by one side or the other. They don’t want to be killed, and they don’t want to be killers. Is it Cruz’s view that a nineteen-year-old, just out of high school, should head for the hills, looking for the moderate Syrian opposition that even the C.I.A. has been unable to find? Or should he languish in a camp, with no prospects of really settling anywhere, as a target for the wrong type of tutor? That is not going to make Europe or the United States any safer. What Cruz and the others are saying is that the threat people are living under, which has been enough to drive them from their homes, should not matter. What does matter is whether we feel threatened by them.","2741","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The other insinuation that Cruz and others are making is that Obama doesn’t like Christians, and refuses to acknowledge the Islamic character of terrorism—maybe, they suggest, because of his character, or because of who he is. “I recognize that Barack Obama does not wish to defend this country,” Cruz said. And saying that was shameful, too.","2742","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"In the media coverage of Tuesday’s Democratic debate, there was almost universal agreement that Hillary Clinton came out on top.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, I pronounced Clinton the big winner, saying that she had been “sharp, personable, and assured.” I also said that Sanders “gave a good account of himself,” but that didn’t satisfy some readers. Within hours, the complaints were raining in—on Twitter, on Facebook, and elsewhere. Had I been coöpted by the Clinton campaign? Was I watching the same debate as everybody else? Did I have a clue what I was writing about?","2744","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"

"It’s certainly possible that I, and many other commentators, got it wrong. The media has erred before, plenty of times. Back in April, when Sanders announced his candidacy, many observers wrote him off as a fringe candidate who wouldn’t have much of an impact. I didn’t make that particular error: indeed, I welcomed Sanders to the race, pointing out that he would “provide a voice to those Democrats who agree with him that the U.S. political system has been bought, lock, stock, and barrel.” That one I got right. But on the Republican side, after Donald Trump jumped in, I underestimated his staying power, as did many other members of the media. Did we get the Democratic debate wrong, too?","2746","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"Let’s look, briefly, at the case for the prosecution. At AlterNet, the alternative-news site, Adam Johnson pointed out, “Sanders won the CNN focus group, the Fusion focus group, and the Fox News focus group; in the latter, he even converted several Hillary supporters. He won the Slate online poll, CNN/Time online poll, 9News Colorado, The Street online poll, Fox5 poll, the conservative Drudge online poll and the liberal Daily Kos online poll. There wasn’t, to this writer’s knowledge, a poll he didn’t win by at least an 18-point margin.”","2747","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"At the other end of the ideological spectrum, Dick Morris, the Republican political strategist and Clinton antagonist, suggested that the media no longer understands a Democratic electorate that has moved to the left and is now highly issues-oriented. “Sanders identified and successfully focused on his two main issues: First, income inequality and the need to break up the big banks and second, the need for more restraint in committing military forces abroad,” Morris wrote on his Web site. “These two positions, clearly articulated in the debate will impel Sanders to a steep rise in the polls.”","2748","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The ultimate arbiter of who won the debate will, of course, be the public, not the pundits. But we won’t get a reliable reading of public opinion until we see some scientifically conducted surveys based on random samples of Democratic voters. The post-debate online polls weren’t of this type: their samples were self-selecting, and you would expect their results to be skewed toward the candidate with the most-committed supporters. In this race, without a doubt, that is Sanders.","2749","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The only post-debate poll I’ve seen that employed orthodox surveying techniques was carried out by the research firm Gravis Marketing, and it showed Clinton as the clear victor. Researchers for Gravis asked a random sample of seven hundred and sixty registered Democrats across the United States this question: “Who do you think won the debate?” Sixty-two per cent of respondents said Clinton, thirty per cent said Sanders, and six per cent said Martin O’Malley. It’s just one poll and its results aren’t definitive, but if most Democratic voters, in fact, believe that Sanders won, it is an enormous outlier.","2750","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The findings of the media focus groups deserve to be taken more seriously than the online polls, but here, too, representativeness is an issue. For the first G.O.P. debate, Frank Luntz, who runs focus groups for Fox News, organized a panel of Republican voters, which said that Donald Trump had performed poorly. Subsequently, Trump’s lead in the polls increased (and he excoriated Luntz on Twitter). Still, the fact that all three of the focus groups mentioned in Johnson’s article identified Sanders as the winner shouldn’t be dismissed; nor should the participants’ responses. When Luntz asked some members of his group, which consisted of Democratic voters from Florida, for a one- or two-word description of Sanders’s performance, these were some of the responses he received: “for the people,” “strong,” “straightforward,” “confident,” “direct,” “sincere,” “powerful,” “educator,” and “smart.”","2751","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"As I noted in my post-debate post, Sanders certainly “got his message through.” As Morris pointed out, it’s a message that resonates with many Democratic voters and is forcing other candidates, Clinton very much included, to adapt to it. It may also be true that Sanders benefitted from the fact that many viewers were seeing him for the first time on the national stage, and that the media underestimated this factor. “Beforehand, a third of Democrats said they didn’t yet know enough about Sanders to have an opinion on him,” Andrew Prokop pointed out in a post at Vox. “Even many of those who did know about him likely hadn’t been exposed to him all that much. So when Sanders makes the case at length for why he’s a democratic socialist, many of these voters might not have heard that before—and might like it.”","2752","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"But just because Sanders did well doesn’t mean he did best of all. In judging the winner of any debate, it’s probably wise to consider at least three questions. Who did the best onstage? Who came out on top in the polls? Who gave his or her campaign the biggest boost?","2753","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The second question I’ve already covered. The answer to the first one is subjective, though anybody who was on a high-school or college debate team knows that it’s not entirely so. Based on Clinton’s manner, her ability to react to what others were saying, and her deftness in evading awkward questions, I think she delivered the best performance, even though, as I wrote yesterday, I strongly disagreed with some of her answers, particularly those relating to Edward Snowden. Some of Clinton’s Republican critics agreed with my assessment of her manner. Trump said that she “did what she had to do.” Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race last month, said, “She came across as surprisingly very confident and I thought relatively pleasant.”","2754","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"So much for technique. The main reason that I think Clinton emerged as the winner relates to the third question: she gave her campaign a huge and much-needed boost. Of all the debate participants, she had the most to lose. After six months in which Clinton struggled to deal with the issue of her use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state, Democratic élites and donors were starting to question her abilities as a candidate. A poor performance on Tuesday could well have engendered outright panic. Clinton not only reassured the elected politicians, interest groups, and donors who have thrown in with her; she dealt a big blow to the “draft Biden” movement, which probably, in hindsight, needed its man to be onstage in Las Vegas.","2755","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The Clinton campaign believes that it can ultimately deal with a buoyant Sanders, even one who raises more money after the debate or gains a few more points in the polls. A panicking Democratic establishment and a swift entry into the race by Joe Biden would have presented a much more alarming scenario—one that now appears to be receding as a possibility. The Vice-President may still decide to run, but it will be harder for him to portray himself as a savior for the Party.","2756","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"

"The tournament, in Queens, coincides with the days of back-to-school and so serves as a balm for re-entry, a soft landing. The jet-setters are back from the beach, but not yet working full tilt. Some want to be seen. Donald Trump, conspicuously present at the Williams sisters’ match in Arthur Ashe Stadium last night, has long been an Open fixture, and, knowing a little about him, one might imagine that, in his mind, he is as much the center of the crowd’s attention as the players on the court. (And, who knows, maybe this time he was.) Anyway, it’s hard to believe that, what with his latest undertaking, he’d be much invested in the outcome of a tennis match. Others may wish the lights weren’t quite so bright. The other night, as the TV commentator Brad Gilbert half-whispered his analysis from courtside, the camera caught, seated to his immediate left, the hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman, looking tan and relaxed, after an August in which the stock market’s swoon had wiped out all his fund’s gains for the year. He did not, as Kim Kardashian did Tuesday night, blow the camera a kiss.","2759","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/court-crazy-in-queens"
"Ashe Stadium, the Open’s prime venue, is huge, seating some twenty thousand people, and so you can’t fill it, or the Louis Armstrong Stadium (ten thousand), or the grandstand and dozens of outer courts, entirely with the rich and famous. There are lots of regular people there, too. Families, tourists, enthusiasts. The court rats come out in droves, often wearing shorts, tennis shoes, and even sweatbands. The thing about tennis, unlike, say, pro football or mixed martial arts, is that a lot of the fans play the game, and so can project their own struggles and strategies onto the professionals. Maybe you can only really appreciate the splendor of Stan Wawrinka’s one-handed backhand if you have been failing for decades to execute such a shot yourself. But you don’t have to have ever picked up a racket to be drawn into the theater of a tense match, especially in the hothouse of Flushing. We start to identify with the players. We make them our avatars. They do it so we don’t have to.","2760","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/court-crazy-in-queens"
"Such projections may blind us to how horribly lonely it is out there on the court, how psychologically and emotionally taxing a tennis match can be. We think we’re right there with them, but we are not. The players are utterly alone. They have to execute with extreme precision over a period of hours while contending with intense physical strain, tactical complexity, and emotional turmoil. There’s really nothing like it in sports. Marathoners are alone for hours, but all they have to do is keep going. Boxers, too—but a fight is a kind of fever dream, and there’s not much time to stand there and contemplate the significance of the next punch. Golfers have caddies. Tennis players may have their entourages—coaches, parents, spouses, celebrity pals—but they are not supposed to communicate with them during the match, so all a player can do is bark and holler in the direction of his box, like a crazy person. It’s the only outlet there is for the voices in their heads.","2761","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/court-crazy-in-queens"
"Next time you watch a big match, try to imagine what’s passing through the player’s mind as he or she prepares, say, to serve on break point. Is it anything like what passes through our own, when we try to do such a thing? If so, I don’t know how the pros do it. Even when I play my younger brother, I go totally bats, and so does he, despite the obvious fact that nobody on earth—not even either of us, really—cares who wins. You’d expect that, after years of training, the pros would have a more disciplined conversation with their inner selves (more “I got this” than “I am falling apart and watching myself fall apart and watching myself watch myself fall apart.”), but then again, in their case, so much more is at stake, plus lights, cameras, Oprah. So it can be fascinating to watch them crack and then (usually) pull themselves together again.","2762","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/court-crazy-in-queens"
"The Williams sisters, in their quarter-final matchup last night, did not go bats. They have played many times before, often with a great deal at stake, but the intersecting arcs of Serena’s historic Grand Slam bid and Venus’s near-valedictory rejuvenation added chips to the pot. The match was intense and strange. The pace was predictably high, the shotmaking wicked, the points short. Serena got caught in a microburst of anxiety that caused her to drop a set. But it was impossible to fathom the turmoil of back talk in their own heads, or the tools they seem to have developed to keep these voices at bay. We search their faces for signs.","2763","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/court-crazy-in-queens"
"Commentators made a lot of the emotional and psychological difficulty the sisters must have in playing each other—John McEnroe and Chris Evert mused about walloping their own siblings—but the sisters themselves spoke almost exclusively of the physical and tactical hardship. Serena said that she blocks out the sister part and that playing Venus is rough just because Venus is better than anyone else she has to play. Serena has been deflecting our presumptions and projections—about family, physique, race—for years. But with these remarks, she was also offering her big sister the consolation of a compliment, while (perhaps unwittingly, or perhaps in keeping with the Williams-vs.-the-world dynamic of the early years) dissing the rest of the field. The psychological tricks apply to press conferences, too.","2764","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/court-crazy-in-queens"
"The Williams match was the first in this tournament of real abiding consequence, and so acted as a kind of overture for the coming weekend. As the last rounds approach, the tennis becomes more about the tennis. The festival atmosphere of the grounds falls away. The outer courts go quiet, and all the action retreats to the stadium, to the matches that matter most. Amid the extraordinary displays of talent and fortitude, and the talk of past greats and this generation’s chance to stand beside or above them, the viewer—watching the ball go back and forth, back and forth, and listening, again and again, to linespeople yelling, “Out!”—may begin to hear an inner voice that, presumably, the players never hear. It says, “Enough already!” When you hear that, you know that fall is here, and it’s time to get back to work.","2765","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/court-crazy-in-queens"

A rancorous congressional debate is still to come, but thirty-four senators have now vowed to support the deal, effectively blocking efforts on the Hill to eventually kill it.

The Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, the Texas senator Ted Cruz, and the conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck are planning a “Stop the Iran Deal” rally at the Capitol, on September 9th, the day after Congress returns from recess and begins to debate the terms. The rally is co-sponsored by Tea Party Patriots, the Zionist Organization of America, and the Center for Security Policy. It’s likely to be as colorful as it is combative. On “Meet the Press” last month, Trump warned that the deal would be a boon to the Iranians. “They are going to be such a wealthy, such a powerful nation,” he said. “They are going to have nuclear weapons. They are going to take over parts of the world that you wouldn’t believe. And I think it’s going to lead to nuclear holocaust.”","2767","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"Former Vice-President Dick Cheney has joined the debate. He is scheduled to give a major address on Iran in Washington next week, at the American Enterprise Institute. “Nearly everything the president has told us about his Iranian agreement is false,” Cheney wrote on Friday, in a Wall Street Journal piece adapted from his book. “He has said it will prevent the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons, but it will actually facilitate and legitimize an Iranian nuclear arsenal. He has said this deal will stop nuclear proliferation, but it will actually accelerate it, as nations across the Middle East work to acquire their own weapons in response to America’s unwillingness to stop the Iranian nuclear program.”","2768","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"The focus in Washington is already shifting, however, to whether the Democrats might be able to win seven more endorsements—for a total of forty-one—to invoke a filibuster that would prevent the deal from even coming to a vote in the Senate. Republicans, with limited Democratic support, have been hoping to pass a Resolution of Disapproval in both the Senate and the House by September 17th. Obama pledged that he would veto it. Support from thirty-four senators now means that the President would be able to sustain his veto—if it comes to that.","2769","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"“We’ve always said that our goal was for the Administration to be able to implement this deal—whatever that took in Congress,” a senior Administration official told me Wednesday.

"So far, the prospects of the Democrats blocking a vote altogether are sketchy. Even support for the nuclear agreement—announced on July 24th, after twenty months of tortured diplomacy between Iran and the world’s six major powers—is either tepid or reluctant in both houses of Congress. Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat from Maryland who retires next year, became the decisive thirty-fourth voice in the Senate on Wednesday. Her views reflected those of many fellow-Democrats.","2771","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"“No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated with the Iranian regime,” Mikulski said. “I have concluded that this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best option available to block Iran from having a nuclear bomb. For these reasons, I will vote in favor of this deal.” She, like many others, had caveats. “However, Congress must also reaffirm our commitment to the safety and security of Israel,” she said.","2772","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"

Israel’s security, Kerry wrote, is “sacrosanct.”","2774","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"Kerry also made an emotional final pitch for the deal, before congressional debate begins next week, in a speech in Philadelphia. “The outcome will matter as much as any foreign-policy decision in recent history,” he said. “To vote down this agreement is to solve nothing. . . . To oppose this agreement is—whether intended or not—to recommend . . . a policy of national paralysis. It is to take us back directly to the very dangerous spot that we were in two years ago—only to go back there devoid of any realistic plan or option.”","2775","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"
"The White House has long claimed that the deal with Iran was about only one issue and does not represent an attempt at rapprochement between Washington and Tehran. But the Administration’s arguments increasingly hint at future possibilities. “The Iran agreement is not a panacea for the sectarian and extremist violence that has been ripping that region apart,” Kerry said in Philadelphia. “But history may judge it a turning point, a moment when the builders of stability seized the initiative from the destroyers of hope, and when we were able to show, as have generations before us, that when we demand the best from ourselves and insist that others adhere to a similar high standard—when we do that, we have immense power to shape a safer and a more humane world.”","2776","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-a-done-deal"

In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, he called the agreement “a beginning for a better understanding for other issues as well.” A more “realistic approach and attitude” by the United States toward Iran would be reciprocated, he said. Larijani is a powerful figure and a conservative. The son of a grand ayatollah, he is a former Presidential candidate. One of his brothers heads the Iranian judiciary, while another heads a human-rights council.

"In the prologue to “The Snow Queen” (the source for Disney’s “Frozen”), Hans Christian Andersen describes “an evil troll”—the devil—who fashioned a mirror with unusual qualities: “It would shrink everything that was good and beautiful to almost nothing and it would magnify whatever was worthless and ugly and make it seem even worse”; its effect on ordinary people was to make “their faces so twisted you couldn’t tell who they were.”","September 2, 2015","2779","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"Andersen’s ingenious mirror, were it to exist, would hardly be necessary when looking at today’s Presidential candidates: the campaign, even at this early stage, has been doing the mirror’s work for it. In a rough count, there are twenty-two contenders, men and women, Republican and Democrat, each one seemingly prepared to keep going. It won’t take long for some of them to become unrecognizable—the way Mitt Romney, once the bright, moderate governor of Massachusetts, four years ago became a “severely conservative” office-seeker. To paraphrase Andersen, Romney’s outlook had become so twisted you couldn’t tell who he was.","2780","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"In contemporary campaigns, which rely so much on artifice and the huge gobs of money that manufacture more artifice, it’s often hard to figure out who these striving people are apart from who they say they are. For instance, is Mike Huckabee, the preacher and former governor of Arkansas, the generous fellow who, seven years ago, came to the defense of the Presidential candidate Barack Obama and his pastor, Jeremiah Wright? (That was when Wright said, among other politically unhelpful things, that African-Americans should not sing “God Bless America” but “God damn America.”) Or is Huckabee the inflexible, unforgiving person who now compares same-sex marriage to swearing and drinking, would allow no exceptions for abortion, and says that, by agreeing to a nuclear deal with Iran, Obama “would take the Israelis and basically march them to the door of the oven”?","2781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"The identity-distortion has its own term of art, the “reset,” often a signal that a candidate isn’t sure what the campaign is about or why it keeps going. When the Times recently reported that Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, looking enviously at polls that favored Donald Trump, “announced a reset of his campaign,” you could only wonder how this shrill, partisan figure (Walker, not Trump) could look any less Presidential. Actually, he managed it by doing several reverse flips on the question of birthright citizenship and the Fourteenth Amendment.","2782","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"Jeb Bush hit his reset button before he formally announced his candidacy. Hillary Clinton, who keeps sinking in key polls no matter how hard she works at sounding like a national leader, has reset her tone and is likely to do so again. On the other hand, Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, who has been trying to come up with a reset strategy, may have fallen so far behind in polls that he won’t qualify for first-tier status in the next Republican debate. With every reset, voters may begin to suspect that a candidate is really saying, “If you don’t like who I am, I’ll be someone else.” If Andersen’s troll does his dirty work, that someone else will be less appealing than the original.","2783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"The enduring example of a candidate with many resets is Richard Nixon, whose most important one came in 1956. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had suffered a major heart attack, in the fall of 1955, and with Ike’s fragile health and an absence of Republican competition, a Nixon Presidency seemed increasingly likely, later if not sooner. Political reporters began to write about a “new Nixon,” suggesting the emergence of a gentler, more thoughtful iteration of someone whose career in politics started in 1946. When Nixon ran for President against John F. Kennedy, in 1960, and CBS’s Walter Cronkite broached the subject, Nixon said, “When people say there is a new Nixon, that must mean that people who did not like the Nixon that they knew before now like the one that they know now. I happen to believe, myself, that perhaps many of those who discover the new Nixon may not have known the old one.” The new Nixon and the old Nixon turned out to be pretty much the same person, but as the Wall Street Journal’s Vermont Royster observed when Nixon ran in 1968, “Nothing seems to fascinate political journalists . . . more than new images on old faces.” Royster might have written that line today.","2784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"The prologue to “The Snow Queen” ends with the mirror breaking into millions of pieces; then, “if a splinter got into somebody’s eye, it stayed there and made everything look bad,” at which “the devil laughed.” It would be nice if a fairy-tale mirror could explain the rise, and rise, of Donald Trump, with his talent for magnifying almost anything to the point where it is gaudy or frightening. But it would be just as helpful to look at his competitors, some of whom, like Jeb Bush, want to take things that are ugly, like his brother’s ruinous Iraq war, and make them disappear. As another Labor Day approaches, fourteen months before the nation chooses its next President, here’s a thought experiment: imagine all the candidates reflected by Andersen’s imaginary mirror and try to see who is truly staring back.","2785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"In 2013, Ben Carson gave a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast that launched his political career. According to the rapturous response on the Internet, Carson’s remarks were a rebuke of President Obama—people saw Carson as an authentic black counterpoint to the President—but they were just as clearly a rejection of what he called the culture of “political correctness.” “The P.C. police are out in force,” he warned from the podium. “We’ve reached a point where people are afraid to say what they think because someone might be offended. People are afraid to say ‘Merry Christmas’ at Christmastime.”","September 22, 2015","2786","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"

There is, however, a logical fallacy at play among many of these opponents, in their presumption that the validity of a statement exists in direct proportion to its capacity to offend.","2787","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"There are few anodyne truths in Ben Carson’s worldview. The decibel of the objections is evidence that he’s struck upon truth. A hit dog hollers, as Southerners say. When, this past Sunday, on “Meet the Press,” Carson voiced his opposition to the idea of a Muslim being elected President, he did so in the same calm, measured tones that attend almost all of his pronouncements. He spoke with the quiet confidence of a man convinced of the rectitude of his own position. Here is Carson responding to a question about whether voters should consider a candidate’s faith:","2788","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"

"Carson’s position within the paranormal wing of the G.O.P. is perplexing for a number of reasons. Unlike Donald Trump, who is capable of making equally inflammatory and nativist comments, Carson’s intellectual accomplishments are indisputable.* He is a product of the most respected educational institutions in the United States and was once a foremost practitioner in a highly complex field of medicine. Yet his virtuoso abilities coexist with a loosely tethered relationship to other types of rational thought. Carson is a scientist who disavows evolution, a citizen who professes to be deeply concerned about democracy yet supports a religious litmus test for public office, and a physician who devoted himself to saving the lives of children but indulges the hypertensive claims of the anti-vaccine element. His bifurcated thinking calls to mind James Watson, the Nobel winning co-discoverer of DNA, who spent years mouthing racist and sexist theories of human intelligence. On the stump, Carson seems like an object lesson in what happens when STEM majors don’t take enough courses in the humanities and social sciences.","2790","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"For reasons connected to his race, his education, and his exceptional talent, Carson at first carried an imprimatur of Serious Thought that the others in the crowded G.O.P. field did not. (Building a real-estate empire, winning a Senate seat, and serving as a corporate C.E.O. are impressive accomplishments, but they are literally not brain surgery.) But Carson’s duelling intellect and paranoia have led him to support untenable positions with minor qualifications. He panders by faint dissent. By stating that he believes that Islam is inconsistent with American democracy and that President Obama is a Christian born in the United States, he validates the substance of birtherism, just not this specific instance of it. When Carson was confronted, during the last Republican debate, with the question of whether vaccines cause autism, he stated that they did not but offered paranoiacs the nebulous chaser that we are giving children too many immunizations. The suggestion that vaccines have some nebulous danger essentially nullified the statement that preceded it.","2791","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"That the party responsible for the Southern strategy, the racist populism of the Reagan era, and the current age of voter suppression can count a black neurosurgeon among its most popular Presidential candidate is in itself a form of vaccination against charges of racism. It means one thing when a white billionaire taps into whites’ anxieties about cultural and economic displacement, and something else entirely when a black man from Detroit validates their conspiratorial fears about the Affordable Care Act. Or when, in an oblivious echo of the Dred Scott decision, an African-American states that entire segments of the population are irreconcilable with the Constitution. Carson’s is not a novel act. Five years ago, Juan Williams, a black journalist who covered civil rights and wrote a biography of Thurgood Marshall, stated that he felt fearful when boarding a plane with Muslims. The ensuing outcry was, predictably, denounced as political correctness.","2792","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"
"The enduring legacy of Carson’s candidacy, however it ends, is likely to be the recognition that, under certain circumstances, cynicism is less of a problem than sincerity. Would that such detached thinking, from so talented a figure, came with a wink and a nod—that it were simply a matter of demagogic competition in a crowded political field. But Carson appears to mean what he says, and there is a consistent market for his brand of exonerating racism, for bigotries so valid that even a brilliant black man endorses them. His certainty that the din of outrage is merely the yelping dog of political correctness prohibits him from fulfilling one of the primary responsibilities of a scientist: the honest evaluation of contrary data. It also blinds him to the widely apparent truth that his politics are not simply incorrect—they’re also wrong.","2793","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-of-ben-carson"

"Late one night in January, 2005, Carly Fiorina sat in a hotel room in Davos, Switzerland, where she was attending the World Economic Forum, in a state of angry dismay. She was the C.E.O. of Hewlett-Packard, and she believed that, in an effort to undermine her, members of the board were leaking confidential information about the company to the press. She had instructed lawyers to question all the members, so that they could “come clean.” Now, on a conference call, they still denied the leaking. Two weeks later, the board fired her. As she writes in “Rising to the Challenge,” her latest memoir, “Fearing for their positions, they behaved in an unprincipled fashion and ousted me from mine.”","2795","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"

She had sold the deal brilliantly, amid a bitter proxy fight, but the execution was badly managed, and the value of the stock fell. All this might have been of interest solely to business-school case writers had not Fiorina unexpectedly risen to the top tier of Republican Presidential contenders, joining the two other non-politicians in the race, Donald Trump and Ben Carson. In G.O.P. circles, she is being greeted as a savior of, if not the Party’s electoral prospects, its sanity—as someone who might allow the focus to return to candidates like Jeb Bush. It’s an awkward space, at the intersection of outsiderdom and fear of the Donald, but, for the moment, Fiorina has claimed it.","2796","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"“It’s only in this country that you can go from being a secretary to the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world,” she told Jimmy Fallon, on “The Tonight Show,” last week. “Wow,” Fallon said. “It’s unbelievable.” It’s also, as with much that Fiorina says, a little more complicated than that. In 1976, Cara Carleton Sneed graduated from Stanford, where her father had been a law professor. (He later served in the Nixon Administration and on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.) She enrolled in law school at U.C.L.A. but dropped out. She worked briefly in a real-estate firm as a receptionist, then got married, moved to Italy for a while, and returned to attend business school in Maryland, after which, Stanford degree and M.B.A. in hand, she was hired as a management trainee at A. T. & T. That was where she met her second husband, Frank Fiorina, a mid-level executive.","2797","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"She quickly became known as a sales prodigy, a reputation that grew when she became a division chief at Lucent, a company formed from A. T. & T.’s telecommunications-equipment business. Some of the deals she closed were, in fact, unbelievable. In 1999, Lucent said that a little-known firm called PathNet would buy as much as two billion dollars’ worth of its equipment. As Fortune noted later, PathNet’s annual revenues were only $1.6 million; Lucent would loan it money for the sale, which was unlikely to be repaid. But by the time such dubious accounting became public, leading to a collapse of Lucent’s stock, Fiorina, who was never accused of wrongdoing, had left for H.P., with a signing bonus worth sixty-eight million dollars and millions more in pay. When H.P. fired her, she got a twenty-million-dollar severance package, plus fifteen thousand dollars for career counselling. Only in this country, perhaps, could a C.E.O. receive compensation worth more than a hundred million dollars in six years, get fired, and use the money to enter politics.","2798","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"Fiorina’s first run for office, in the 2010 U.S. Senate race in California, is best remembered for an Internet ad, produced by her campaign, that portrayed her primary opponent as a demon sheep with glowing red eyes. She won the nomination, then, in the general election, produced a video showing the Democratic incumbent, Barbara Boxer, as a swollen disembodied head. In the current primary campaign, Fiorina has been the target of some misogyny, particularly from Trump, so it is instructive to contrast her dignified response to his comments about her face and her voice—“I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said”—to the use, in her anti-Boxer ad, of footage of fingernails scraping a chalkboard. (Boxer responded with an ad noting that Fiorina had fired thirty thousand employees at H.P., and she won by a million votes.) It is a contradiction that Fiorina seems to revel in; in her memoir, she decries sexism and, in the next paragraph, rejects the “feminist movement” as “politicized” and “captured by a left-wing agenda.”","2799","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-heart-of-the-deal"
"For Fiorina, the center of that agenda is reproductive rights, or, as she puts it, the “butchery” of abortion. In the most recent G.O.P. debate, she called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood and dared President Obama to look at an undercover video about the organization, made by an anti-abortion group: “Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, ‘We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.’ ” There are graphic segments in the video, but it does not show what Fiorina described.

Of the Affordable Care Act, she says, “What you see is emergency-room visits are up over fifty per cent.” (There is no apparent source for this number.) As an executive, she can “read the fine print” of the science on climate change, which, according to her, shows that there’s nothing the U.S. can do about it. California’s drought, she contends, is a “man-made disaster,” not because of climate change but because “liberal” politicians, worried about fish, prevented the state from building dams. “That’s pretty dumb,” she told Chuck Todd.

"“I am who I am,” Donald J. Trump said in August, on the eve of this season’s first G.O.P. Presidential debate, and what he meant by that was this: “I don’t have a pollster.” The word “pollster,” when it was coined, was meant as a slur, like “huckster.” That’s the way Trump uses it. Other candidates have pollsters: “They pay these guys two hundred thousand dollars a month to tell them, ‘Don’t say this, don’t say that.’ ” Trump has none: “No one tells me what to say.”","2803","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

I am who I am, the Candidate says, and my Opponents are flunkies. Trump makes this claim with unrivalled swagger, but citing his campaign’s lack of a pollster as proof of his character, while fascinating, is utterly disingenuous. The Path to Office is long. To reach the Land of Caucuses and Primaries, the Candidate must first cross the Sea of Polls. Trump is a creature of that sea.","2804","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Lately, the Sea of Polls is deeper than ever before, and darker. From the late nineteen-nineties to 2012, twelve hundred polling organizations conducted nearly thirty-seven thousand polls by making more than three billion phone calls. Most Americans refused to speak to them. This skewed results. Mitt Romney’s pollsters believed, even on the morning of the election, that Romney would win. A 2013 study—a poll—found that three out of four Americans suspect polls of bias. Presumably, there was far greater distrust among the people who refused to take the survey.","2805","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"The modern public-opinion poll has been around since the Great Depression, when the response rate—the number of people who take a survey as a percentage of those who were asked—was more than ninety. The participation rate—the number of people who take a survey as a percentage of the population—is far lower. Election pollsters sample only a minuscule portion of the electorate, not uncommonly something on the order of a couple of thousand people out of the more than two hundred million Americans who are eligible to vote. The promise of this work is that the sample is exquisitely representative. But the lower the response rate the harder and more expensive it becomes to realize that promise, which requires both calling many more people and trying to correct for “non-response bias” by giving greater weight to the answers of people from demographic groups that are less likely to respond. Pollster.com’s Mark Blumenthal has recalled how, in the nineteen-eighties, when the response rate at the firm where he was working had fallen to about sixty per cent, people in his office said, “What will happen when it’s only twenty? We won’t be able to be in business!” A typical response rate is now in the single digits.","2806","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Meanwhile, polls are wielding greater influence over American elections than ever. In May, Fox News announced that, in order to participate in its first prime-time debate, hosted jointly with Facebook, Republican candidates had to “place in the top ten of an average of the five most recent national polls.” Where the candidates stood on the debate stage would also be determined by their polling numbers. (Ranking in the polls had earlier been used to exclude third-party candidates.) Scott Keeter, Pew’s director of survey research, is among the many public-opinion experts who found Fox News’s decision insupportable. “I just don’t think polling is really up to the task of deciding the field for the headliner debate,” Keeter told me. Bill McInturff doesn’t think so, either. McInturff is a co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies, the leading Republican polling organization; with its Democratic counterpart, Hart Research Associates, he conducts the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. “I didn’t think my job was to design polling so that Fox could pick people for a debate,” McInturff told me.

"Even if more people could be persuaded to answer the phone, polling would still be teetering on the edge of disaster. More than forty per cent of America’s adults no longer have landlines, and the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act bans autodialling to cell phones. (The law applies both to public-opinion polling, a billion-dollar-a-year industry, and to market research, a twenty-billion-dollar-a-year industry.) This summer, Gallup Inc agreed to pay twelve million dollars to settle a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of everyone in the United States who, between 2009 and 2013, received an unbidden cell-phone call from the company seeking an opinion about politics. (Gallup denies any wrongdoing.) In June, the F.C.C. issued a ruling reaffirming and strengthening the prohibition on random autodialling to cell phones. During congressional hearings, Greg Walden, a Republican from Oregon, who is the chair of the House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, asked F.C.C. chairman Tom Wheeler if the ruling meant that pollsters would go “the way of blacksmiths.” “Well,” he said, “they have been, right?”","2808","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

Not everyone uses the Internet, and, at the moment, the people who do, and who complete online surveys, are younger and leftier than people who don’t, while people who have landlines, and who answer the phone, are older and more conservative than people who don’t. Some pollsters, both here and around the world, rely on a combination of telephone and Internet polling; the trick is to figure out just the right mix. So far, it isn’t working.

Companies like Civis have been collecting information about you and people like you in order to measure public opinion and, among other things, forecast elections by building predictive models and running simulations to determine what issues you and people like you care about, what kind of candidate you’d give money to, and, if you’re likely to turn out on Election Day, how you’ll vote.

"A “poll” used to mean the top of your head. Ophelia says of Polonius, “His beard as white as snow: All flaxen was his poll.” When voting involved assembling (all in favor of Smith stand here, all in favor of Jones over there), counting votes required counting heads; that is, counting polls. Eventually, a “poll” came to mean the count itself. By the nineteenth century, to vote was to go “to the polls,” where, more and more, voting was done on paper. Ballots were often printed in newspapers: you’d cut one out and bring it with you. With the turn to the secret ballot, beginning in the eighteen-eighties, the government began supplying the ballots, but newspapers kept printing them; they’d use them to conduct their own polls, called “straw polls.” Before the election, you’d cut out your ballot and mail it to the newspaper, which would make a prediction. Political parties conducted straw polls, too. That’s one of the ways the political machine worked.","2812","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

"A century ago, newspapers that wanted to predict the outcome of a Presidential election had to join forces. In 1908, the New York Herald, the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Chicago Record-Herald, and the St. Louis Republic tallied their straws together. William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers did the same thing. But the best predictions were made by a national magazine, the Literary Digest, beginning in 1916. It regularly miscalculated the popular vote, but for a long time it got the Electoral College winner right. In 1920, the Digest mailed out eleven million ballots. By 1932, its mailing list had swelled to twenty million. Most of those names were taken from telephone directories and automobile-registration files. George Gallup was one of the few people who understood that the Digest risked underestimating Democratic votes, especially as the Depression deepened, because its sample, while very big, was not very representative: people who supported F.D.R. were much less likely than the rest of the population to own a telephone or a car.","2814","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Gallup was borrowing from the insights of social science. Social surveys, first conducted in the eighteen-nineties, had been a hallmark of Progressive Era social reform. In 1896, W. E. B. Du Bois went door to door in Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward and interviewed some five thousand people in order to prepare his study “The Philadelphia Negro.” In the nineteen-thirties, social scientists argued for the merits of a shortcut that relied on statistical science: surveying a tiny but representative sample of a population.","2815","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

In 1928, in a dissertation called “An Objective Method for Determining Reader Interest in the Content of a Newspaper,” Gallup argued that “at one time the press was depended upon as the chief agency for instructing and informing the mass of people” but that newspapers no longer filled that role and instead ought to meet “a greater need for entertainment.” He therefore devised a method: he’d watch readers go through a newspaper column by column and mark up the parts they liked, so that he could advise an editor which parts of the paper to keep printing and which parts to scrap.","2816","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"In 1932, when Gallup was a professor of journalism at Northwestern, his mother-in-law, Ola Babcock Miller, ran for secretary of state in Iowa. Her late husband had run for governor; her nomination was largely honorary and she was not expected to win. Gallup had read the work of Walter Lippmann. Lippmann believed that “public opinion” is a fiction created by political élites to suit and advance their interests. Gallup disagreed, and suspected that public opinion, like reader interest, could be quantified. To get a sense of his mother-in-law’s chances, Gallup began applying psychology to politics. The year of the race (she won), Gallup moved to New York, and began working for an advertising agency while also teaching at Columbia and running an outfit he called the Editors’ Research Bureau, selling his services to newspapers. Gallup thought of this work as “a new form of journalism.” But he decided that it ought to sound academic, too. In 1935, in Princeton, he founded the American Institute of Public Opinion, with funding provided by more than a hundred newspapers.","2817","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

He was right on both counts. This was only the beginning. “I had the idea of polling on every major issue,” Gallup explained. He began insisting that this work was essential to democracy. Elections come only every two years, but “we need to know the will of the people at all times.” Gallup claimed that his polls had rescued American politics from the political machine and restored it to the American pastoral, the New England town meeting. Elmo Roper, another early pollster, called the public-opinion survey “the greatest contribution to democracy since the introduction of the secret ballot.”","2818","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Gallup’s early method is known as “quota sampling.” He determined what proportion of the people are men, women, black, white, young, and old. The interviewers who conducted his surveys had to fill a quota so that the population sampled would constitute an exactly proportionate mini-electorate. But what Gallup presented as “public opinion” was the opinion of Americans who were disproportionately educated, white, and male. Nationwide, in the nineteen-thirties and forties, blacks constituted about ten per cent of the population but made up less than two per cent of Gallup’s survey respondents. Because blacks in the South were generally prevented from voting, Gallup assigned no “Negro quota” in those states. As the historian Sarah Igo has pointed out, “Instead of functioning as a tool for democracy, opinion polls were deliberately modeled upon, and compounded, democracy’s flaws.”","2819","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Ever since Gallup, two things have been called polls: surveys of opinions and forecasts of election results. (Plenty of other surveys, of course, don’t measure opinions but instead concern status and behavior: Do you own a house? Have you seen a doctor in the past month?) It’s not a bad idea to reserve the term “polls” for the kind meant to produce election forecasts. When Gallup started out, he was skeptical about using a survey to forecast an election: “Such a test is by no means perfect, because a preelection survey must not only measure public opinion in respect to candidates but must also predict just what groups of people will actually take the trouble to cast their ballots.” Also, he didn’t think that predicting elections constituted a public good: “While such forecasts provide an interesting and legitimate activity, they probably serve no great social purpose.” Then why do it? Gallup conducted polls only to prove the accuracy of his surveys, there being no other way to demonstrate it.

In the Presidential election of 1944, George Gallup underestimated Democratic support in two out of three states. When Congress called him in for questioning to answer the charge that “the Gallup poll was engineered in favor of the Republicans,” Gallup explained that, anticipating a low turnout, he had taken two points off the projected vote for F.D.R.

"In the wake of polling’s most notorious failure, the political scientist Lindsay Rogers published a book called “The Pollsters: Public Opinion, Politics, and Democratic Leadership.” Rogers, the Burgess Professor of Public Law at Columbia, had started out as a journalist and, as a scholar, he was a humanist at a time when most students of government had turned away from the humanities and toward social science. (Amy Fried, in an essay about what was lost in that abandonment, has called him “the Forgotten Lindsay Rogers.”) He had drafted “The Pollsters” before the election debacle; his concern had very little to do with miscalculation. Where Blumer argued that polling rests on a misapplication of social science, Rogers argued that it rests on a misunderstanding of American democracy. Even if public opinion could be measured (which Rogers doubted), he believed that legislators’ use of polls to inform their votes would be inconsistent with their constitutional duty. The United States has a representative government for many reasons, among them that it protects the rights of minorities against the tyranny of a majority. “The pollsters have dismissed as irrelevant the kind of political society in which we live and which we, as citizens, should endeavor to strengthen,” Rogers wrote. Polls, Rogers believed, are a majoritarian monstrosity.","2829","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"The alarms raised by Blumer and Rogers went unheeded. Instead, many social scientists came to believe that, if the pollsters failed, social science would fail with them (not least by losing foundation and federal research money). Eight days after Truman beat Dewey, the Social Science Research Council appointed an investigative committee, explaining that “extended controversy regarding the pre-election polls among lay and professional groups might have extensive and unjustified repercussions upon all types of opinion and attitude studies and perhaps upon social science research generally.” The committee concluded that the problem was, in part, quota sampling, but, in any case, the main work of the report was to defend the sample-survey method, including a landmark project founded at the University of Michigan in 1948, which became the most ambitious and most significant survey of American voters: the American National Election Survey.","2830","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"In 1952, Eisenhower unexpectedly defeated Stevenson. “Yesterday the people surprised the pollsters, the prophets, and many politicians,” Edward R. Murrow said on CBS Radio. “They are mysterious and their motives are not to be measured by mechanical means.” But politicians don’t want the people to be mysterious. Soon, not only political candidates but officeholders—including Presidents—began hiring pollsters. Meanwhile, pollsters claim to measure opinions as elusive as Americans’ belief in God, as the sociologist Robert Wuthnow points out in a compelling and disturbing new book, “Inventing American Religion: Polls, Surveys, and the Tenuous Quest for a Nation’s Faith.” In 1972, when Congress debated a Truth-in-Polling Act, longtime pollsters like Gallup attempted to distance themselves from campaign and media pollsters. Called to testify, Gallup supported the bill, objecting only to the requirement that pollsters report their response rates. That same year, in “Public Opinion Does Not Exist,” the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu revisited arguments made by Herbert Blumer. As these and other critics have demonstrated again and again, a sizable number of people polled either know nothing about the matters those polls purport to measure or hold no opinion about them. “The first question a pollster should ask,” the sociologist Leo Bogart advised in 1972, is “ ‘Have you thought about this at all?

"If public-opinion polling is the child of a strained marriage between the press and the academy, data science is the child of a rocky marriage between the academy and Silicon Valley. The term “data science” was coined in 1960, one year after the Democratic National Committee hired Simulmatics Corporation, a company founded by Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political scientist from M.I.T., to provide strategic analysis in advance of the upcoming Presidential election. Pool and his team collected punch cards from pollsters who had archived more than sixty polls from the elections of 1952, 1954, 1956, 1958, and 1960, representing more than a hundred thousand interviews, and fed them into a UNIVAC. They then sorted voters into four hundred and eighty possible types (for example, “Eastern, metropolitan, lower-income, white, Catholic, female Democrat”) and sorted issues into fifty-two clusters (for example, foreign aid). Simulmatics’ first task, completed just before the Democratic National Convention, was a study of “the Negro vote in the North.” Its report, which is thought to have influenced the civil-rights paragraphs added to the Party’s platform, concluded that between 1954 and 1956 “a small but significant shift to the Republicans occurred among Northern Negroes, which cost the Democrats about 1 per cent of the total votes in 8 key states.” After the nominating convention, the D.N.C. commissioned Simulmatics to prepare three more reports, including one that involved running simulations about different ways in which Kennedy might discuss his Catholicism.","2834","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

The political scientist Kenneth Janda speculates that the technological advantage of the Republican Party during these years stemmed from its ties to big business.

There he developed a method called “matched sampling”: he uses the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which surveys a million people a year, to generate a random sample according to “fifteen variables of representativeness” and to determine who will participate in polls. “You get a million people to take the poll, but you only need a thousand, so you pick the thousand that match your target population,” he explained to me.","2838","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Sometimes when political scientists are hired by corporations their research becomes proprietary. “When I say I don’t know the secret sauce, I really don’t know it,” Arthur Lupia says of political scientists who sell their research to businesses rather than publish it in journals that would require them to reveal their methodologies. Lupia is a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, a former director of the American National Election Survey, and the lead author of “Improving Public Perceptions of Political Science’s Value,” a 2014 report prepared by a task force established by the American Political Science Association. Where once social scientists avidly defended the polling industry, many have grown alarmed that media-run horse-race polls may be undermining the public’s perception of the usefulness of social-science surveys. (Lupia jokes that horse-race polls ought to have a warning label that reads “For entertainment purposes only.”) Like Rivers, Lupia ardently believes in the importance of measuring public opinion. “It is critical for a nation that cherishes its democratic legitimacy to seek credible measures of how citizens think, feel, and act in electoral contexts,” Lupia and the political scientist Jon Krosnick have written. Otherwise, “there will be no strong evidentiary basis for differentiating propagandistic tall tales from empirically defensible and logically coherent readings of electoral history.”","2839","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"It’s an important point. But it may be that media-run polls have endangered the academic study of public opinion and of political behavior. Public disaffection with the polling industry has contributed to a plummeting response rate for academic and government surveys.","2840","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"Those surveys are invaluable, the political scientist Sidney Verba has argued. “Surveys produce just what democracy is supposed to produce—equal representation of all citizens,” Verba said in a presidential address before the American Political Science Association in 1995. “The sample survey is rigorously egalitarian; it is designed so that each citizen has an equal chance to participate and an equal voice when participating.” Verba sees surveying public opinion not only as entirely consistent with democratic theory but as a corrective to democracy’s flaws. Surveys, Verba argues, achieve representativeness through science.","2841","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"The best and most responsible pollsters, whether Democratic, Republican, or nonpartisan, want nothing so much as reliable results. Today, with a response rate in the single digits, they defend their work by pointing out that the people who do answer the phone are the people who are most likely to vote. Bill McInturff, of Public Opinion Strategies, told me, “The people we have trouble getting are less likely to vote.” But the difficulty remains. Surveying only likely voters might make for a better election prediction, but it means that the reason for measuring public opinion, the entire justification for the endeavor, has been abandoned. Public-opinion polling isn’t enhancing political participation. Instead, it’s a form of disenfranchisement.","2842","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"
"“There are all kinds of problems with public-opinion research, as done by surveys,” Lupia admits. “But a lot of the alternatives are worse. A lot of what we’d have would be self-serving stories about what’s good for people. ‘When given a clear choice between eggs and bananas, ninety-eight per cent of the people prefer one or the other.’ Prior to the polls, I can say that, and you have no check on me. But if there’s a poll you have a check.”","2843","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

Whether or not they’re making money, people who predict elections want to be right, and they believe, as fiercely as Lupia does, that they are engaged in a public good. I asked Doug Rivers what role the measurement of public opinion plays in a democracy. He said, “The cynical answer is ‘Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down.’ ” (He was quoting a Tom Lehrer song.) But Rivers isn’t cynical. He believes that polling “improves the quality of representation.” I asked him to give me an example. He said, “You couldn’t have had the change in gay marriage without the polling data.” Everyone cares where the rockets come down.","2844","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine"

"There are theories, out there, that the pyramids of Egypt are really giant batteries, or even electric generators. Think about it: their granite blocks were originally encased in limestone, almost as if they had been insulated, as a power conductor is, with rubber. They once had golden capstones, a bit like the copper-tops on Duracells. All that granite piled up creates a magnetic field or a radioactive one, depending on which engineering schematics one favors—this reading of the pyramids takes a number of forms—and has a profound effect on negative ions. The King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid contains what may look like a sepulchre but is really where all the gold wiring that ran through the pyramid met—a pharaonic circuit board. The pyramid is a cross between the Tower of Babel and the Tesla Tower: a massive source of wireless power, which explains why the torches that figures carry in Egyptian wall paintings aren’t plugged into anything. Delve too deeply, and the question seems less whether the pyramids are big and intricate machines built by ordinary hardworking Egyptians than whether they were built (perhaps, originally, upside down) by extraterrestrials, who might someday return to activate their force fields or laser beams. But that might be a bit much, as Ben Carson, who is running for President, would be the first to tell you.","November 5, 2015","2857","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“Various scientists have said, ‘Well, you know there were alien beings that came down and they have special knowledge and that’s how they were,” Carson said, at a graduation speech at Andrews University, in 1998. (BuzzFeed found the video.) “You know, it doesn’t require an alien being when God is with you.” The explanation for the pyramids was not only divine but laid out in one of the best-known Bible stories, which tells how Joseph, after his brothers had sold him into slavery in Egypt, had interpreted a dream of the Pharaoh’s to mean that Egypt would have seven fat years followed by seven years of famine. The Pharaoh then assigned him to do some emergency planning. (Genesis 41: “Lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.”) “My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain. Now all the archeologists”—here, Carson waves his hand dismissively—“think that they were made for the pharaohs’ graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don’t think it’d just disappear over the course of time, to store that much grain.” Carson had his own take on the engineering: “When you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they’d have to be that way for a reason.” The King’s Chamber, as he saw it, was not an instrument panel or a power substation, but a big Tupperware container.","2858","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“It’s still my belief, yes,” Carson said, on Wednesday, when CBS News asked him if he still held to this theory. Then, with an almost pitying smile, Carson explained again, as if to a child, that “the pyramids were made in a way that they had hermetically sealed compartments. You wouldn’t need hermetically sealed compartments for a sepulchre. You would need that if you were trying to preserve grain for a long period of time.”","2859","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"“That was a strange deal,” Donald Trump said, when asked about Carson and the pyramids. This time, the Donald is right. There are problems with Carson’s theory. For one thing, there is very good archeological and historical evidence that the pyramids were built as monumental tombs with a religious function; they were first built among complexes of tombs. There is also pretty good evidence of an extensive network of granaries, often associated with local temples. It’s odd that Carson, a critic of big government, would assume that the only way to manage the storage job was with a giant four-faced bubble—but since the pyramids are not actually hollow, and don’t have all that much storage space relative to their size, perhaps they would be an example of statist inefficiency. (Putting aside the question of whether those chambers were ever “hermetically” sealed, the dry climate of Egypt did mean that such sealing would not have been necessary.) A pyramid also takes longer than seven years to build. Also, the pyramid-building dynasties—the Third Dynasty (c. 2700–2600 B.C.), with its step-pyramids, and the Fourth Dynasty (c. 2600–2500 B.C.), with the great pyramids at Giza—do not match many of the guesses for when a historical Joseph might have lived, which range to the Eighteenth Dynasty. The counter-argument to that might be that, since we know almost nothing about Joseph, we might as well place him anywhere. Why not treat all of Egyptian and Biblical history as collapsible, and shuffle their incidents and artifacts as much as we like, under the general rubric of ancientness?","2860","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"There are mysteries about the pyramids—they were built, after all, nearly five thousand years ago—and we don’t know everything about how workers (free or not) were deployed, or what the geometry of the layout symbolized. Archeologists and engineers are still learning things from, for example, the found remnants of nearby construction camps. But that sort of study is not Carson’s project. In the 1998 commencement address, he moved quickly from the pyramids to doubts about the Big Bang theory, saying, “That’s the wonderful thing about having a relationship with God. You know, God has already told us what happened, so we don’t have to come up with fanciful theories about things.”","2861","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"When Carson speaks about pyramids, he does so with the same pretense of practicality that he brings to many topics. He is a doctor, and a bearer of knowledge, including the news that the standard stories Americans are told, whether about economics, history, or science, don’t add up. Joseph was a better model, a slave who “ended up as the Prime Minister of the most powerful nation in the world at the time”; because he persisted and listened to God, he “was basically able to save the entire world with his big thinking.” Does Carson think that there is someone else who might do that? (It might interest him that the historical figure actually credited with managing the work on the earliest pyramids, a civil servant named Imhotep, was also thought to be a medical doctor.)","2862","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"
"Thursday, the day after his CBS News interview, was a busy one for Carson, who is leading or close to Donald Trump in many polls—between them, they’ve got half of the Republican-primary electorate covered. His campaign released a radio ad with a rap beat (“Go and support Ben Car-son/For our next President and be awe-some”) and was working to counter a CNN report that suggested that, despite what Carson wrote in his autobiography, he might not have been a violent teen-ager who once almost killed his friend. It seems strange for a candidate to be offended by the idea that he had actually been a nice kid—Romney had to answer to the opposite charge—and a little like being puzzled that an ancient torch has no wires attached. But, in the context of this campaign, in which Carson has made a point of how God changed his character, there is a rationale for both the exposé and for his response. The whole business stopped making sense some time ago. A certain number of Republicans turned to Carson because the other candidates seemed even less plausible to them. As the granary theory is to the idea of the pyramids as a giant battery or the work of alien architects, so is Carson to Trump—although, some days, it seems like the other way around.","2863","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ben-carson-among-the-pyramids"

Thus, on the eve of last night’s debate, Ted Cruz, channelling Herman Cain from four years ago, unveiled a plan for a flat tax of ten per cent on personal income. Perhaps recognizing the fact that there is a limit to what anybody, even a diehard Tea Party supporter, will believe, Cruz didn’t claim that this proposal would balance the budget. Instead, he cited a study from the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based research organization, and claimed that it would cost less than a trillion dollars.","2869","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"The second problem the Republicans have—and this will become even more acute as the election approaches—is that, by many measures, the U.S. economy is doing pretty well. In the past five years, the unemployment rate has been cut in half, and about twelve million new jobs have been created. G.D.P. has been growing at a steady, if unspectacular, rate for more than six years.

"The big drawback with the Obama recovery is that it has been very lopsided, with the folks at the top receiving most of the gains, and those in the middle and at the bottom seeing little or no income growth. During the debate, some Republicans seized on this. Jeb Bush claimed that the incomes of middle-class families have fallen by twenty-three hundred dollars since President Obama took office. Cruz said that the share of income going to the top one per cent has never been higher.","2871","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Such data make good talking points for the G.O.P. candidates, but they also raise an awkward problem for the Party and its 2016 nominee-to-be. Tackling rising inequality isn’t exactly a Republican strength. Almost all of the candidates’ tax plans are extremely regressive: they would benefit the well-off more than everybody else. That’s partly because all of the plans would cut the top income-tax rate, which is currently 39.6 per cent. And it’s partly because most of the proposals would also sharply reduce the tax rates on dividends and capital gains, the forms of payment in which the super-rich receive most of their income.","2872","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Take Cruz’s tax plan, which might be the most regressive and irresponsible one yet. According to the preliminary Tax Foundation analysis that Cruz cited, households in the top one per cent of the income distribution would see their post-tax income rise by 29.6 per cent, whereas households in the middle twenty per cent of the distribution would see their incomes rise by 1.5 per cent or less. (I’m citing the “static” estimates, which don’t incorporate an overly rosy growth scenario for tax revenues. But the “dynamic” figures also show a big difference in how the ultra-wealthy would make out relative to everybody else.)","2873","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"These aren’t the sorts of figures that any candidate, except perhaps one running for the Presidency of his local Rotary Club, wants to advertise. And it also turns out that Cruz’s claim about his plan costing less than a trillion dollars was highly suspect. According to the Tax Foundation, the actual figure is $3.6 trillion. It was only by invoking some very optimistic assumptions about G.D.P. growth that the Foundation’s analysts got the number below a trillion dollars.","2874","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Relative to the other candidates’ plans, Cruz’s proposal is at the edge of the curve, but in its basic features it’s not atypical. Given the way these plans work, about the only way to have them avoid looking like reverse-Robin Hood schemes is to exempt some of the households at the bottom of the income distribution from any federal income tax. That’s what Marco Rubio’s plan would do, for example, and another analysis from the Tax Foundation suggests that he was right when he claimed, in response to a challenge from CNBC’s John Harwood, that the biggest gains (in percentage terms) under his proposal would go to the poor. But the exemptions in his plan wouldn’t apply to payroll taxes paid by poor families, and they wouldn’t apply to any of the taxes paid by middle-income households. So Harwood, who had said that very rich households would make out a lot better than average households under Rubio’s plan, was also right.","2875","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"That assessment is also true of Bush’s plan, and of Trump’s plan, and of Carson’s plan, and of Huckabee’s plan, and of Paul’s plan. Indeed, when you delve into the details of the Republicans’ economic proposals, it’s easy to see why most of them would rather not get into the details. G.O.P. primary voters tend to be tax averse. But most of them are also averse to tilting things even more in the direction of the donor class.","2876","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"
"Before ending, I should note that one or two of the Republican candidates have put out more credible proposals. In what they describe as efforts to shore up Social Security, for example, Bush and Chris Christie have suggested raising the retirement age and cutting the benefits that rich retirees receive. Since benefit cuts are hugely unpopular, about the only people who have cheered these proposals are budget hawks at Washington think tanks.","2877","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance"

He had come to San Francisco thirteen years earlier with his wife and two children, “dreaming and hoping to make this land my own.” A dapper man, he learned English, wore three-piece suits, became a naturalized citizen, and opened a general store and import business on Fillmore Street, in San Francisco. But when Bagai tried to move his family into a home in Berkeley, the neighbors locked up the house, and the Bagais had to turn their luggage trucks back. Then, in 1923, Bagai found himself snared by anti-Asian laws: the Supreme Court ruled that South Asians, because they were not white, could not become naturalized citizens of the United States. Bagai was stripped of his status. Under the California Alien Land Law, of 1913—a piece of racist legislation designed to deter Asians from encroaching on white businesses and farms—losing that status also meant losing his property and his business.

Obstacles this way, blockades that way, and bridges burnt behind.”","2880","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"Bagai could have been speaking for the mass of Asian-Americans—Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Hmong, and Filipinos—who escaped colonialism or economic hardship at home only to encounter a country rancid with racism. Racism, as Lee shows, was the unifying factor in the Asian-American experience, bringing together twenty-three distinct immigrant groups, from very different parts of the world. It determined the jobs that Asians were able to acquire, the sizes of their families, and their self-esteem in America. If Asian America exists, it is because of systemic racism.","2881","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"A few weeks ago, Donald Trump climbed a stage and crassly mimicked a Japanese (or was it a Chinese?) accent, in supposed admiration of the old stereotype that the Japanese are soulless, rapacious businessmen. This was just after Jeb Bush defended his use of the term “anchor babies” by saying that it was “more related to Asian people” than to Latinos. In September, the F.B.I. finally dropped all charges against Dr. Xi Xiaoxing, a Chinese-American physicist at Temple University arrested, in May, for passing on sensitive superconductor technology to China. The F.B.I. had claimed it had blueprints of the technology, but when independent experts examined the blueprints, they found that they weren’t for the device in question. “I don’t expect them to understand everything I do,” Xi told the Times. “But the fact that they don’t consult with experts and then charge me? Put my family through all this? Damage my reputation? They shouldn’t do this. This is not a joke. This is not a game.”","2882","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"These are just a few recent stories, of course, but they stand in for many others. Asian-Americans are still regarded as “other” by many of their fellow-citizens. And yet one finds among some Asian-Americans a reluctance to call out racist acts, in part because of their supposed privilege in comparison with other minority groups. Meanwhile, much of the history of Asians in America, a history that now spans nearly half a millennium, has been forgotten.","2883","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"The first Asians to come to North America, Lee writes, were Filipino sailors. They came aboard Spanish ships in the late fifteen-hundreds, and were subjected to such a torrent of vermin and filth on these vessels that half died en route; when they got to colonial Mexico, many refused to cross the Pacific again. They settled in Acapulco and married local women. Asian America began in desperation.","2884","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"Many of the immigrants in the seventeen-hundreds and eighteen-hundreds came from lands sucked dry by colonialism, such as the Guangdong province, in China, reeling from drought and famine after the Opium Wars. Lured by contractors and agents, Chinese, Indian, Korean, and Japanese men travelled across the globe to toil on sugar and tobacco plantations in the British West Indies, Hawaii, and the Deep South as indentured laborers or “coolies,” working ten hours a day, six days a week, for five or more years before gaining freedom. (Some Asian women were hired as indentured servants, too, mostly in an attempt to pacify the men.) When the men gained their freedom, though, they often chose not to return to their homes—either, Lee writes, out of shame (their earnings didn’t match their boasts to people back home) or because they had married locals during their lonely sojourns and couldn’t take them back. Lee cites a few of their melancholic letters to family members, but one wishes she had gone deeper into the psychology of exile: many immigrants subsist on a diet of denial, believing, sometimes until their deaths, that they will go back.","2885","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"From the initial ports of entry, Asians, particularly the Chinese and Filipinos, radiated outward, so that, in the mid-eighteen-hundreds, there was a Filipino fishing village in Louisiana and a Chinatown in Havana, as well as active Chinese communities along much of the West Coast. Lee describes life and labor in these communities well, explaining, for instance, why Chinese immigrants got into the laundry business during the Gold Rush. (At the time, it was cheaper for someone living in San Francisco to have clothes washed in Honolulu than to get them laundered in the city. Chinese immigrants seized the opportunity that provided.) Lee is particularly acute on the racism these immigrants endured. Chinese were called, at various times, “rats,” “beasts,” and “swine.” The president of the American Federation of Labor said that the presence of the Chinese in America was a matter of “Meat vs. Rice—American Manhood vs Asiatic Coolieism.” Kaiser Wilhelm woke from a nightmare in 1895 and commissioned a hideous painting showing the archangel Michael beset by heathen hordes from the East—the famed “yellow peril.” When more Chinese started coming after the Gold Rush, employed on large projects like the Pacific Railroad, anti-Chinese sentiment became shrill. In 1882, on the basis that Chinese workers undercut wages, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, banning low-skilled and family immigration, and making the Chinese, in Lee’s words, “the first illegal immigrants.” (As Jiayang Fan noted in a recent piece for this magazine, “The act, which wasn’t repealed until 1943, remains the only federal law ever to exclude a group of people by nationality.”) Special agents known as “Chinese catchers” appeared on the border with Mexico, and the Secretary of Labor despaired that “not even a Chinese wall” along the border would stop Chinese immigration. In 1871, in the largest mass lynching in American history, seventeen Chinese men were murdered by a mob of five hundred, in Los Angeles.","2886","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"Other Asians—Indians, Koreans, and Japanese—followed, and they, too, faced xenophobia. Koreans, who wished to fight for their freedom from Japan, were treated as Japanese subjects; Indians were considered British subjects. But these groups were not as large as the Chinese, and thus not as threatening. Still, stereotypes spread fast. Of thirty-nine immigrant groups, Indians were, according to the 1911 United States Immigration Commission, “the least desirable race of immigrants.” The editor of the Bellingham Reveille, in Washington, described Hindus as “repulsive in appearance and disgusting in their manners,” and, in 1907, the entire South Asian population was forced out of Bellingham in a single night with cries of “Drive out the Hindus.” (Bellingham, a lumber-mill town, had a long history of receiving—and then expelling—poor Asian laborers.) In another famous episode, when the Komagata Maru, a ship from Hong Kong, tried to dock in Vancouver, British Columbia, to challenge the racist 1908 Continuous Journey Regulation law—which held that Asians could only emigrate to Canada if they made a near-impossible non-stop voyage from the country of their citizenship—it was sent back to Calcutta. The people onboard were jailed by the British, and twenty-six were shot dead as they resisted arrest.","2887","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"American policies toward Asians reached a nadir in 1924, with the implementation of a law that sought “to preserve the idea of American homogeneity” and denied admission to the country to most non-whites. Immigration from Asia was banned completely, with the establishment of an “Asiatic Barred Zone.” In the years immediately before and after, no plea by Asians to become citizens succeeded. When Bhagat Singh Thind, a Sikh-American who had fought with the United States Army in the First World War, argued before the Supreme Court that he was an Aryan and should, therefore, be allowed to keep his citizenship, his case was dismissed on the grounds that the “great body of our people instinctively … reject the thought of assimilation” of South Asians. Takao Ozawa, an assimilated Japanese man, sued for naturalization, in 1917, citing his Christian values, his American education, and his desire to “return the kindness which our Uncle Sam has extended to me.” He was denied, because he wasn’t Caucasian. This low point in immigration was followed by the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War.","2888","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"Then the fate of Asian-Americans began to turn. The Cold War remapped dynamics between nations. Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea, considered weak nations, were now allies. Their citizens couldn’t be targeted by official policy in the same way. The civil-rights movement, meanwhile, took on open racism, including that faced by Asians. Still, when Lyndon Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, dismantling racial quotas and allowing skills- and family-based immigration, he didn’t do so to help Asians; rather, Greeks and Poles and Italians had cried foul about the larger immigrant quotas for Northern Europeans, and those cries had been heard. Johnson, not known for his modesty, cautioned that it was “not a revolutionary bill” and would “not affect the lives of millions.”","2889","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"He was wrong. In the years after, Asian-American life changed enormously, with the population swelling from less than one per cent of all Americans, in 1960, to nearly six per cent, or 19.5 million, today. Refugees from the Vietnam War, in the sixties and seventies, made Asian America, and America itself, even more diverse, and women, largely excluded in previous eras—less than one per cent of the Chinese entering the United States in 1900 were women, thanks to the Chinese Exclusion Act—poured in. Asians began to appear in the “model minority” jobs we associate them with today.","2890","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"There are now, in a sense, two Asian Americas: one formed by five centuries of systemic racism, and another, more genteel version, constituted in the aftermath of the 1965 law. These two Asian Americas float over and under each other like tectonic plates, often clanging discordantly. So, while Chinese-Americans and Indian-Americans are among the most prosperous groups in the country, Korean-Americans, Vietnamese-Americans, and Filipino-Americans have lower median personal earnings than the general population. Over-all Chinese-American prosperity obscures the higher-than-average poverty rate for Chinese-Americans. In 2000, Asian-Americans were more likely to have college degrees than other adults in America, but also five times as likely as whites to have fewer than four years of education. More damningly, the reputations of Asian-American groups, just as in the past, can turn on a dime, with national or international events triggering sudden reversals. After 9/11, for example, the I.N.S.’s National Security Entry-Exit Registration System required the fingerprinting and registering of immigrants from twenty-five nations, twenty-four of which were Arab and Muslim. (Portions of the program were discontinued in 2011.) Hate crimes spread to encompass groups such as Sikh-Americans, with a mass shooting at a temple in Wisconsin as recently as 2012. In February, when a middle-aged white man in North Carolina shot three Muslim college students dead over what the police claimed was “an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,” the father of one of the victims pointed out, “I am sure my daughter felt hated, and she said, literally, ‘Daddy, I think it is because of the way we look and the way we dress.’ ”","2891","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"
"In the eyes of some, Asians in America are, Lee writes, “perpetual foreigners at worst, or probationary Americans at best.” If Asians sometimes remain silent in the face of racism, and if some seem to work unusually hard in the face of this difficult history, it is not because they want to be part of a “model minority” but because they have often had no other choice.","2892","http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas"

"Last week was a good one for Hillary Clinton. It started with her appearance on “Saturday Night Live.” Kate McKinnon did her customary Clinton impression, this time sitting in a bar, trying to forget about Donald Trump. Clinton played Val the bartender, who seemed to embody how the former Secretary of State would like to be seen: as a hardworking, wryly funny older friend, whose earned wisdom you can turn to at the end of a long day. They sang “Lean On Me,” and, after Clinton left, McKinnon pronounced, “She was real and smart and really nice in person!”","2899","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Two days later, the “Today” show found Clinton flipping pancakes for voters in New Hampshire. When she was asked yet again about her e-mail accounts, she dismissed the question and cited the extraordinarily impolitic boast made a few days earlier by the House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, who had told Fox’s Sean Hannity, “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today?” The Republicans were embarrassed, and Clinton benefitted. Last Thursday, McCarthy was forced to drop out of the race to succeed John Boehner as Speaker of the House.","2900","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Clinton is still scheduled to testify before the Benghazi committee a week after the first Democratic Presidential debate, which will be sponsored by CNN and held on October 13th, in Las Vegas. The Benghazi hearings would seem to have little credibility left, but both events will mark a new stage of the campaign for Clinton, one in which she will have to relinquish the tight control she has maintained over her appearances. At the debate, she will be joined onstage by Bernie Sanders, who has launched a strong challenge and is now favored by twenty-five per cent of likely Democratic voters, to her forty-two per cent, and by Martin O’Malley, Lincoln Chafee, and Jim Webb, all of whom are polling in the one-per-cent range. Vice-President Biden, because he is polling at around eighteen per cent, is eligible to take part, even if he declares at the last minute.","2901","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Biden’s role has been a big open question. Another is why this first debate is so late in coming. The Republicans have already had two, each of which attracted more than twenty million television viewers, and will stage ten more. The Democratic National Committee has authorized only six. One is the Saturday night before Christmas; another is the Sunday night before Martin Luther King, Jr., Day—not times likely to attract large audiences. Given the concerns about the Presidency being passed between a couple of families, why set up a schedule that seems designed to squelch lesser-known candidates’ chances?","2902","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The lesser-knowns have objected, but Clinton doesn’t seem to mind. One reason for that might be gleaned by looking back to October 30, 2007, when the Democrats debated in Philadelphia. Clinton was the front-runner then, too, and it was the thirteenth time the candidates had met. But it was also, arguably, the first time that her opponents—Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, John Edwards, Christopher Dodd, Joe Biden, and, most improbably, Barack Obama—seriously challenged her, on all fronts. Edwards accused her of “doubletalk.” Obama called her out for “changing positions whenever it’s politically convenient”—she was “for NAFTA previously, now she’s against it”—and for not being “truthful.” A lot of the time was taken up asking why records of her official work in her husband’s White House were sealed in the Clinton Presidential library. She responded with what must have been intended as judiciousness but came across as obfuscation. When Tim Russert, one of the moderators, tried to determine whether she was in favor of issuing driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants—she had indicated both yes and no—she called his question a “gotcha.”","2903","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"In the days that followed, Clinton and her campaign tried to frame the debate as a Hillary-against-the-world moment, a “pile-on,” orchestrated by what she called, in a speech at Wellesley College, “the all-boys’ club.” Clinton had been considered the winner in most of the previous debates, and even many of her supporters acknowledged that this one marked a turning point. A week before, she was at 48.5 per cent in an average of polls, the highest she had ever been. (Obama registered 21.2.) Immediately afterward, she began a decline and, despite some rebounds, never matched that number again.","2904","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"From her perspective, there may have been something broken about the 2008 debates. A remarkable eighteen million people voted for her during the primary season, and she and her supporters may feel that a process that derailed her then is not one to follow now. But, if Clinton has concluded that the lesson of 2008 is to avoid debates, she does not yet understand why she lost that night in Philadelphia. Polls still show that a perception of dishonesty is her greatest problem among voters. (“They don’t trust you. They might not like you,” Savannah Guthrie told her last week.) Often, that perception is the product of unfair partisan attacks, but, as in 2008, it is also sometimes the result of her decisions. Last Wednesday, Clinton announced that she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that is a high priority for President Obama, even though she had praised the negotiations when she was Secretary of State (“the gold standard in trade agreements”) and referred to them proudly after she left office.","2905","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The thinking appears to be that she’ll score points with Sanders voters and with organized labor, while Biden, as a loyal member of the Administration, will have to support the T.P.P.—a classic triangulation. But it echoes Obama’s nafta comment from the Philadelphia debate, just as the questions about her White House records now sound like a prelude to the e-mail issue. Fair or not, she needs to push herself to a greater level of openness, and figure out how to have a good week based on a real-world confrontation, not a comedy-sketch encounter. Clinton stayed in the 2008 race for eight months after her loss in Philadelphia. By the end, Barack Obama was a palpably stronger candidate. So, for that matter, was Hillary Clinton. A few weeks after Philadelphia, she had picked herself up and gone to the next debate, in Las Vegas—the site of this week’s meeting—where she performed well. The last question, from a young woman, was a “fun” one: “Do you prefer diamonds or pearls?” Clinton laughed. “Now, I know I’m sometimes accused of not being able to make a choice,” she said. Then she added, “I want both.” ♦","2906","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"

I said I was cheering for the U.S., but I also shared that I was a fan of Mexico because of my family. The Mexicans provided a novel solution. “Clap for the Mexico team, and clap even louder for the Americans—this is your home, and although you’re a part of our culture, you’re an American,” a woman from the group said in Spanish.

My friend Angel, who accompanied me to the game wearing a black Mexico jersey, jumped out of his seat and threw his fist into the air. “Yes! Yes! Yes!” he yelled out into the sky, and then, playfully, mocked me while placing his hand on my shoulder in a conciliatory fashion. I smiled. This game was far from over.

In response, Fox Sports made its own ad offering its take on the edited version of Trump’s speech, and it, for the most part, failed among American fans, many of whom decried the use of the speech. Why Fox Sports thought it would be a good idea to use a speech in which a political candidate made racist and xenophobic comments to support the U.S men’s soccer team—whose players have roots in Mexico and other countries—is just baffling.","2912","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/choosing-sides-when-the-u-s-plays-mexico"

The real challenge is I am American, and any real uncertainty on the matter is a result of this type of external pressure. This is because many who identify as Americans, mostly white men and women with ties to European immigrants, who have older claim to the title, argue that my family and I are less deserving of such designation—or maybe not deserving at all.","2913","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/choosing-sides-when-the-u-s-plays-mexico"

He could probably be successful leading a program anywhere else in the world, and yet he chose to come to the U.S. and work here.

Thus they sealed their fates.

"This leaves Rubio and Cruz, who seem likely to be among the last ones standing late next spring: first-term Cuban-American senators, both forty-four years old, career politicians, fluent in the glib art of anti-political speech. Rubio offers a scripted hopefulness, while Cruz, who’s reminiscent, physically and rhetorically, of Joe McCarthy, comes off as both more intelligent and more sinister. What distinguishes them from the others in the field is their ability to articulate views that sound substantive enough to command respect but extreme enough to compete with the fantastical dogmas of the outsiders. (Even when there’s no substance: philosophers, for example, earn about twice the pay of welders, whose incomes put them in the ranks of the downwardly mobile working class.)","2940","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/still-standing-the-emerging-republican-platform"
"Rubio promises that struggling Americans will fare better under standard trickle-down economic policy in the future than they have in the past. Cruz has developed a potent argument linking corporate lobbies, the wealthy, and the federal government in a nexus of corruption that’s laid at the feet of Democrats. “You know, the biggest lie in all of Washington and in all of politics is that Republicans are the party of the rich,” he said. “The truth is, the rich do great with big government. They get in bed with big government.” The differences between Rubio and Cruz are mostly tactical and temperamental: Rubio, careful and a bit callow, is trying to split the difference between the angry base and the party establishment. Cruz, an ideological zealot who makes enemies easily, is playing to the far right. Rubio is for eliminating taxes on investments; Cruz wants to reduce all taxes to a flat and vanishingly low ten per cent.","2941","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/still-standing-the-emerging-republican-platform"

The so-called monuments serve as reminders of where one country begins and another ends, all the while disregarding history, geography, and the people who see it for what it really is—a politically charged illusion forced on border residents by faraway governments, in Washington and Mexico City. This is a frontier shaped over centuries, by explorers who go back to the Spanish Conquista, and further back, before the Mayans and Aztecs, back before the lands divided.

"On a spring afternoon, I drive along Paisano Drive, in El Paso, and spot shiny white-and-green Border Patrol vans crawling alongside an eighteen-foot fence. The agents seem bored, guarding the world’s most powerful country from possible terrorists, but mostly from Mexican men and women. The vans are parked next to the rusted fence that divides two neighbors sharing one bloodline, long historic tensions, and current trade of about a million dollars per minute, or $1.4 billion per day.","2947","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/faces-from-the-border-we-could-be-them"

He’s usually most comfortable on his Harley, dressed in jeans and a tight T-shirt that shows off his tattooed biceps. I ask him what it takes to guard the border, and he responds with the kind of nuance he says is needed to do the job of trying to divide good and evil and our own inherent preconceived notions. “The border isn’t always black and white,” Hagelsieb says. “The real key is understanding the gray areas, and never forgetting this is also where you come from.

He’ll complete the construction of a two-thousand-mile-long wall—“a beautiful wall”—along the U.S. border, at a price tag of billions of dollars, and charge it to the Mexican government.","2950","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/faces-from-the-border-we-could-be-them"
"Trump’s fulminations against Mexico have also included the possibility of denying birthright citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants.

They booed whenever the man they jokingly refer to as pato, or duck, spoke.

"The agents along the border are the most important part of America’s security buildup, rather than the new toys or technology, from Predator drones to geospatial intelligence systems to underground motion sensors. Many of them grew up nearby. Some are often the sons and daughters of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. when the border line was not as hard of a line. Their personal experience, dual-language skills, and bicultural background are essential for them to deliver results at their work as border guardians. They may be naturalized citizens or first-generation Americans, or their parents or grandparents may have crossed the border illegally in the past. Many share one trait as they do their jobs: an understanding that the people on the other side of the border, or who are trying to cross the border illegally, could be them.","2953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/faces-from-the-border-we-could-be-them"
"Hagelsieb’s gray areas encompass the borderlands where the U.S. and Mexico blend together, the shared history between citizens of both countries. To begin with, he says he proudly lives in the shadow of his father, also named Oscar. The same monuments around him are the ones that his father, a native of Sonora, once crossed by to work as a gardener, often of manicured golf courses, in El Paso. Back then, in the nineteen-fifties, the lines were blurred. The times were more fickle; policies, then as now, were hypocritical, although some would say more pragmatic.","2954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/faces-from-the-border-we-could-be-them"
"Sometimes, as the elder Hagelsieb crossed the Rio Grande, especially in the scorching heat of summer, he would patiently wait for Border Patrol agents to detain him. Once inside the pale-green vans, he’d tell them where he was headed: the home of their boss, the Border Patrol chief, for whom he did some general gardening jobs. They were all laughs and smiles.","2955","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/faces-from-the-border-we-could-be-them"
"When he wasn’t working for the chief, he’d have to run from the same agents. One morning, after narrowly escaping, he made a decision that changed his destiny. He decided he’d had enough of the uncertainty. Rather than risk getting caught every day as he made his way to work, he moved in order to make a life in El Paso. A former bracero—guest worker—he eventually earned a green card and later brought with him his young bride, with whom he would raise a family. Oscar, Jr., the youngest of four children born in the United States, was a curious boy with dreams of one day working in law enforcement.","2956","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/faces-from-the-border-we-could-be-them"
"Years later, in his twenties, a young and anxious Hagelsieb sat down with his father to make known his career choice. He had rehearsed the lines, thinking he’d have to convince his father, who listened patiently. It turned out that Hagelsieb wanted to be a Border Patrol agent, to protect his own country from his father’s. He wanted to protect those monuments, the same ones his father once ignored.

"Over the past few days, as family members of the nine people killed by a gunman at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, prepared to bury their loved ones, many of the G.O.P. candidates for President have been offering their thoughts on what to do—or, rather, what not to do—about gun violence.","October 7, 2015","2966","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Let’s start with Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is currently running second, behind Donald Trump, in the G.O.P. polls. Participating in an exchange on Facebook on Monday night, Carson recalled removing bullets from gunshot victims, and added, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” On Tuesday morning, Carson went on Fox News and said, “It’s the person behind the gun. Guns don’t kill people.” He didn’t stop there. Asked what he would do if a gunman walked up to him, put a gun to his head, and asked him what his religion was, Carson replied, “I’m glad you asked that question. Because not only would I probably not coöperate with them, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’ ”","2967","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"It’s hard to believe that anybody, let alone a politician running for national office, would insult the victims of a massacre by suggesting that their response had been inadequate. About the most that can be said for Carson is that he isn’t a professional politician: he’s a novice. So is Trump, who, on Tuesday, described himself as a “very big Second Amendment person,” and suggested that the problem in Umpqua was that no one on the scene, apart from the twenty-six-year-old shooter, was armed. (At least one student, an Army veteran, was carrying a gun, a few buildings away.) Trump also said that he opposed a ban on assault weapons—a proposal that he expressed support for in 2000.","2968","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"But, surely, the serious candidates—the Jeb Bushes and Marco Rubios—must have said something more consequential. Not exactly.","2969","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Bush’s “stuff happens” line, which he uttered in South Carolina on Friday, has already entered the political lexicon and provided a gift to the Democrats. Rather than rehashing the debate about whether the remark was taken out of context (it wasn’t), let’s examine what Bush has said since then. After all, he’s had five more days to clarify how he would tackle gun violence. On Monday, he released a new campaign video, which said nothing about what happened in Oregon. On Tuesday, he published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register, which also didn’t bring up the massacre or its aftermath. Then, on Tuesday night, Bush delivered a long speech at a Republican dinner in Iowa. Once again, he made no mention of Umpqua or guns.","2970","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Perhaps that is not surprising. The recipient of an “A+” rating from the National Rifle Association, Bush, during his time as governor of Florida, vigorously opposed efforts to expand gun control, and signed into law the notorious “Stand Your Ground” law. Marco Rubio, who is now leading Bush in most polls, is perhaps a more interesting case. Back in 2000, when he was running for a seat in Florida’s House of Representatives, Rubio said that he supported “reasonable restrictions” on gun sales. And after the Sandy Hook massacre, in December, 2012, Rubio’s spokesman said that Rubio would support measures to keep guns out of the hands of felons and the mentally ill.","2971","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Since then, though, Rubio has backtracked and cozied up to the N.R.A. While campaigning in Iowa on Friday, he said, “Criminals don’t follow gun laws. Only law-abiding people follow gun laws.” On Tuesday, appearing on NBC’s “Today” show, he said, “The laws that many are proposing would have done nothing to prevent these attacks.” Rather than focussing on measures like expanding background checks for gun purchases, “the country should examine mental illness.”","2972","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Many of the other G.O.P. candidates took a similar line. “The problem is mental illness and not necessarily gun registration or gun ownership,” Rand Paul said in a radio interview. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” Chris Christie told George Stephanopoulos, “I’m very concerned about the mental-health side of this.” On CNN’s “At This Hour,” Mike Huckabee said, “Do we need to do a better job in mental health? You bet we do.”","2973","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"What about Carly Fiorina, who promotes herself as a can-do, problem-solving leader? Couldn’t she say something different and less predictable? No. Fiorina, too, is a loyal supporter of the N.R.A., whose annual meeting she addressed earlier this year in a campaign-style video, boasting about her husband’s concealed-carry permits and saying, “When government takes away our guns, we are headed down a dangerous path.” On Friday, Fiorina criticized President Obama’s impassioned call for action, describing it as “premature, at best,” and “at worst, a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy.”","2974","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"That was the pretty much the same thing Fiorina said in June, after Obama reacted to the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. In fact, this is now the standard Republican/N.R.A. line. Each one of these massacres is regrettable and demands further study. But anybody who states the blatantly obvious—that countries with strict guns laws don’t have this problem—is politicizing the issue; they should either zip it, or confine themselves to expressing concern over mental illness.","2975","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"Of course, as HBO’s John Oliver pointed out over the weekend, talking about mental illness is largely a diversion, which distorts the facts about gun violence and serves to preserve the status quo. In 2013, during the Obama Administration’s effort to get some relatively minor gun-control laws through Congress, the White House proposed increasing the funding for mental-health programs and other initiatives designed to identify and help people who are potentially dangerous. Republicans in the Senate blocked the gun-control measures anyway, and no doubt they’d do the same this year if Obama were to send over a similar bill. On this issue, elected G.O.P. officials aren’t interested in reason or compromise. They are interested, primarily, in avoiding a challenge in the next election from an N.R.A.-backed candidate.","2976","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"
"In a sense, there’s nothing new here. For decades now, the N.R.A. and the rest of the gun lobby have had a grip on the Republican Party. But as the number of gun massacres has increased the consequences of this political capture have become harder to ignore. Now, in the full glare of a Presidential election, they cannot be avoided. Rather than engaging in an honest effort to address gun violence and prevent more senseless carnage, practically every G.O.P. candidate has been reduced to repeating a mantra that many of them, surely, cannot fully believe.","2977","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra"

"On the morning of October 10th, Marco Rubio, Florida’s junior senator, mounted a small stage at the Elks Lodge in Boulder City, Nevada, a popular retirement spot near Las Vegas. In his twenties, as an obscure Republican state legislator, Rubio exhibited such innate political skill that Dan Gelber, the Democratic leader of the Florida House, warned his colleagues, “When Marco Rubio speaks, young women swoon, old women faint, and toilets flush themselves.” Now that he was a Presidential candidate, Rubio was trying to speak to as many different audiences as possible. The Elks Lodge was decorated modestly, with just a few campaign banners hoisted amid the taxidermy—a demonstration of thrift intended to contrast with the front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, the billionaire Donald Trump, and to counter claims that Rubio occasionally spends more money than he should.","2979","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The attendees were predominantly older white couples, who were seeing Rubio in person for the first time. The son of Cuban immigrants, he grew up mostly in Miami, but he lived in Las Vegas from 1979 until 1985, when he left, after eighth grade. “I love coming back to southern Nevada, because it’s a place where I actually learned so much about the American Dream,” he said. “My father was a bartender at Sam’s Town”—an Old West-style casino, seven miles off the Strip. “My mother was a maid at what was then called the Imperial Palace.” He went on, “They used to have a show called ‘Legends in Concert.’ We saw that show, like, ten times. I met ‘Elvis’ and ‘Marilyn Monroe.’ You know you’re getting old when the Legends in Concert are people you used to listen to in high school.” Big laugh. Adam Hasner, a friend who served with Rubio in the Florida House, told me, “When you’re running for office in Miami-Dade County, you’re spending a lot of time in senior centers.”","2980","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At the age of forty-four, Rubio has lively dark eyes, soft cheeks, and downy brown hair affixed in a perfect part. He sometimes asks crowds to see him in the tradition of a “young President who said, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.’ ” (J.F.K. was forty-three when he entered the White House.) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, is only five months older than Rubio, but nobody calls him boyish.","2981","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"If the Democrats nominate Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the Party will be offering the oldest candidate that it has ever run in a general election, and Rubio has taken to saying, “Never in the modern history of this country has the political class in both parties been more out of touch with our country than it is right now.” But in policy terms Rubio can appear older than his years. His opposition to same-sex marriage, to raising the minimum wage, and to restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba puts him out of step with most American Latinos.

"After a summer submerged in a raucous primary field, Rubio had recently climbed into third place. He was ahead of Jeb Bush, his former mentor, and far behind Trump and Ben Carson. Trump’s campaign marched to the sound of a dirge—“The American Dream is dead,” he told crowds—and Rubio presented himself as a sunny alternative, a way out of Trump’s sulfurous moment. “We’re very blessed to have so many good people running for President,” he said earnestly to the crowd in Boulder City.","2983","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I had seen Rubio at half a dozen events—in Iowa, New York, Nevada—and his speeches were blemished only by a tic: he occasionally slips into a singsong cadence, turning his story into a breathy schoolboy lullaby about the “new American century.” On the whole, he is impressively consistent. Rubio in Dubuque in October was nearly indistinguishable from Rubio in Miami in April, the political equivalent of a well-managed restaurant chain: “Repeal and replace Obamacare,” scrap President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran “on Day One,” create the “most affordable business taxes in the world”—all the while heeding the populist frustrations of the moment. Vowing to remake higher education, he said, “When I’m President, before you take on student loans you’re going to know how much people make when they graduate from that school with that degree. You’re going to know that the market for philosophers has tightened over the last two thousand years.” In 2012, Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, spoke worshipfully of “job creators.” Rubio rarely mentions them. He returns, over and over, to his central task: how to make helping the poor and the middle class a Republican issue. He tells crowds, “We can no longer allow big government to be used as a tool of crony capitalism.”","2984","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But, at bottom, his campaign is only partly about policy. In a contest against a real-estate tycoon and the son and brother of former Presidents, Rubio is campaigning on the vision of a country where “the son of a bartender and a maid” can reach the White House. “It’s not just my story—it is literally our story,” he told the Boulder City crowd. “In this nation, we are all but a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the very purpose of their lives. Whether or not we remain a special country will be determined by whether or not that journey is still possible for the people trying to make it now.”","2985","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The applause was long and loud, and as Rubio climbed down from the stage to pose for selfies I asked the first couple I saw what they made of him. Cornelia Wallace, a retired nurse from the Chicago suburbs, said, “Well, I’ve got tears welled up in my eyes.” She laughed at her own reaction. “It touched my heart,” she said, and shrugged. “I get a passion from him that I don’t get from the others.”","2986","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In Las Vegas, Rubio was staying at the Bellagio. We met in a suite appointed in the Vegas Italianate style—leather, chrome, photos of fountains. When I stopped by one morning, the windows were shrouded by heavy burgundy drapes, and Rubio was worried about his voice. “I’ve been coming down with something,” he said, crossing the conference room to retrieve a bottle of water. “My throat is always feeling dry.” Doctors had told him it was an allergic reaction. “I said, ‘How come I’ve never had allergies before, and now, suddenly, the last four years I’ve developed allergies? And the answer the doctor gave me was: ‘Well, because you’re travelling to places that you never used to travel to before.’ ”","2987","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

"Rubio, who was spending three days in Nevada, had scheduled both public and closed-door activities. On the first night, he met with Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and donor. In April, Politico had published a story headlined “RUBIO TAKES LEAD IN SHELDON ADELSON PRIMARY,” which reported that Rubio had been calling Adelson every two weeks. I asked Rubio about it, and he said, “I don’t know about every couple of weeks, but I talk to him quite a bit.” Adelson spent about ninety-eight million dollars in connection with the 2012 campaign, including twenty million on the campaign of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He has yet to commit to a candidate in 2016. Rubio described Adelson and himself as natural allies. “The only thing Sheldon Adelson has talked to me about policy-wise is Israel,” he said. “And he doesn’t have to convince me on that, because I’m pro-Israel with or without Sheldon’s support.”","2989","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign had invited donors from around the country to join him at the Bellagio, for a football-themed retreat. The guests attended a “breakfast and team talk” and a strategy session called “Quarterbacking Victory.” One afternoon, they played flag football at a nearby sports complex, and Rubio was the quarterback on both teams. Over the years, he has developed the ability to disarm jaded donors. Bob List, the former governor of Nevada, told me about watching Rubio work a roomful of prosperous Las Vegas businessmen. At one point, Rubio was asked where his inspiration for politics originated. “He said, ‘I remember one day my father took me in the car, and we drove over to the neighborhood where Liberace’s house was.’ ” List noted, “And everybody knew where Liberace’s house was.” He went on, “He said, ‘We would drive around that neighborhood, and he’d show me where all the rich people lived, and he’d say, “Son, if you want to live like these people, you can do it.” ’ ” List shook his head and said, “He’s good-good.”","2990","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio, who has entered six elections and never lost, is alert to the appearance of overweening ambition. “All my life I’ve been in a hurry to get to my future,” he wrote in his memoir, “An American Son,” published in 2012, his second year in the Senate. In conversation, he sometimes answers so quickly that his friend Dennis Baxley, a Republican in the Florida House, once gave him a piece of advice. “I said, ‘Marco, don’t change anything you’re saying, but just wait, like, three seconds before you say it, and you’ll look so pensive.’ ” When things go wrong, Rubio’s impatience can suggest a man climbing too fast for his own good. In Washington foreign-policy circles, people remember a moment at the Brookings Institution, in April, 2012, when Rubio was delivering a major foreign-policy speech. Reaching the final page, he discovered that it had been removed accidentally from the lectern. Some politicians might have improvised; Rubio stopped awkwardly, in mid-sentence, and asked for the page to be returned.","2991","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Republican strategists, the loss of the 2012 Presidential election contained signals that spoke to the Party’s future. Latinos are the largest minority group in America, but in 2012 “there was more talk about electrified fences than there was about higher education and tuition,” Peter Wehner, a Republican speechwriter and strategist who served in the past three Republican Administrations, told me. “You can’t win elections when you do that.” Romney, who had called for the “self-deportation” of immigrants, received just twenty-seven per cent of the Latino vote—seventeen points less than what George W. Bush received in 2004. For years, Republicans have believed that they should be faring better with Hispanic voters. Ronald Reagan liked to say that Latinos are Republicans but “just don’t know it yet.” Lionel Sosa, a Texas adman who was hired to run Reagan’s outreach program to Latinos, recalled, “Ronald Reagan told me, back in the 1980 race, ‘Latinos are conservative people. As Republicans, we share the same basic conservative values. We believe in hard work. We believe in family.’ ”","2992","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Wehner and other reform-minded conservatives, the lessons of 2012 were also economic. “The middle class felt vulnerable and nervous, because of stagnant wages for twenty-five years and skyrocketing costs in health care and higher education,” Wehner told me. “The Party needed an agenda, and it was out of touch with middle-class concerns.” The reformers urged the Party to get over same-sex marriage (a “losing battle”), focus on economic anxiety, and, above all, identify a leader who could articulate a vision that reached beyond Party orthodoxy. As Wehner put it, “You need a figure like a Bill Clinton or a Tony Blair, who can reassure the base and inspire them, but also to signal to people who are not voting for you, ‘We get it.’ ”","2993","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Whit Ayres, a leading Republican analyst who has been Rubio’s pollster for the past five years, drew a somewhat different lesson. He agreed about the demographic reality. “Unfortunately for Republicans, the math is only going to get worse,” he wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. “Groups that form the core of G.O.P. support—older whites, blue-collar whites, married people and rural residents—are declining as a proportion of the electorate. Groups that lean Democratic—minorities, young people and single women—are growing.” He calculated that, in order to win, a Republican Presidential candidate would need at least forty per cent of the Latino vote. But in “2016 and Beyond: How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America,” published earlier this year, Ayres made a subtle distinction between style and substance. He wrote that polls have found “no evidence that America has shifted to the left.” In his view, America remains a center-right country, the Party’s core ideas are sound, and the problem lies in finding “the right candidate, the right message, and the right tone.” He tested a range of ways of presenting core Republican ideas and composed a list of dos and don’ts. Don’t say we have to reform entitlements or “we will never balance the budget.” Do say that entitlement reform is “the only way to save popular programs.”","2994","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The Party’s plans to change its tone did not last long. In the 2014 midterm elections, conservative candidates seized on reports of a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the Mexican border, spurred largely by gang- and drug-related violence in Central America, and proclaimed an immigration crisis. Though the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended at the border was at its lowest level in decades, voters who were anxious about jobs and opportunity responded to increasingly militant language. When Trump announced his candidacy, this summer, he said of Mexicans, “They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Mel Martínez, the former Florida senator (the chamber’s first Cuban-American) and a former head of the Republican National Committee, told me, “Republicans say, ‘Mel, what do we have to do to get the Hispanic vote?’ And one thing I would say is, ‘First of all, stop offending Hispanics!’ ” He urged the parties not to regard a diverse range of voters as a single bloc. “The bottom line is that we are not ‘Hispanics.’ We’re Cuban-Americans, we’re Mexican-Americans, and so forth.” Cuban-Americans represent only about four per cent of the Latino population, and their votes and interests are not always in accord with those of other Latinos. For one thing, many Latinos resent the accelerated path to citizenship that Congress bestowed on Cuban arrivals during the Cold War, a privilege not granted to Colombians, Guatemalans, and others who have faced repression.","2995","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"“There are persuaders and there are crusaders, and I think Rubio is a persuader,” Wehner told me. “When you’re losing Presidential elections on a consistent basis, you’ve got to nominate somebody who is a persuader.” A conservative Super PAC ranked Rubio as the ninth most conservative member of the 114th Congress, but, unlike Ted Cruz, who amplifies confrontation, he excels at rounding off the corners of conventional conservative prescriptions. “I want to be the world leader in renewables,” he tells crowds. “But we better also be the world leader in oil and natural gas.”","2996","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At times, Rubio’s desire to embrace competing views becomes unworkable. In January, he voted for a Senate resolution affirming that climate change is real, but he often voices doubts about the role of humans in it. I mentioned that this puts him at odds with the young generation that he wants to represent. He said, “People who are passionate about climate change come to us and say, ‘The environment is changing because of human activity. The scientists say so.’ And then they say, ‘And here’s what we want you to do.’ And so they present me with this idea, and I look at this idea, and I ask them, ‘Well, if I pass this, how many inches or feet of sea rise will it prevent?’ And they’ll say, ‘Well, it won’t prevent any.’ I say O.K. Then I turn to the economists and say, ‘What impact will this law have on the economy?’ And they say, ‘It will increase the cost of living, it will cost jobs, it will make America less competitive economically.’ And so I say, ‘So you’re asking me to pass something that’s bad economically and does nothing for the environment other than lead the way by example? I think that’s a bad trade-off. I’m not supporting those laws.’ ” (Ken Caldeira, a senior scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Department of Global Ecology, at Stanford, told me, “If Senator Rubio is talking to scientists who say that avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions won’t help avoid sea-level rise, he is talking to the wrong scientists.”)","2997","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s inclusiveness can invite caricature. He considers himself a Catholic, but he attends two churches—an evangelical Protestant service on Saturdays and a Roman Catholic Mass on Sundays. He used to proclaim his love of nineties-era hip-hop—particularly Tupac Shakur—but recently he has also taken to praising cross-genre artists, such as Drake and the Weeknd, who blend electronic dance music with hip-hop, rap, and R. & B. “It’s a twenty-first-century ability to take music and use it in a way that motivates people,” he said last month on CNN, mirroring his campaign rhetoric. “Some of it is blended with other sounds that are sampled from recordings that others have had in the past, and you see traditional artists being brought in and their voices used on an electronic soundtrack.”","2998","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s ecumenism is one reason that prominent Democrats consider him the most worrisome contender. David Axelrod, Obama’s former chief strategist, told me that Rubio “seems to be able to build bridges between the two factions of the Republican Party.” He said, “There is a real civil war going on between populist anti-government Republicans and the establishment conservatives, and Rubio has thus far been able to escape that divide.” Axelrod added, “But it’s going to be harder as time goes on, and he is probably going to have to plant his feet in one place or another.”","2999","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio if it concerned him that Republicans often appear to be at war with themselves. A day earlier, the House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, facing intense criticism by conservative members of his party, had abandoned plans to run for Speaker. “If the alternative was they all went into a smoke-filled room and cut a deal outside the limelight, everyone would say, ‘Oh, then it’s a done deal, it’s a stagnant process,’ ” Rubio said.

"Marco Antonio Rubio was born in Miami in 1971, the third of four children. (The oldest, Mario, became an Army Green Beret and, later, a city official in Jacksonville; Rubio’s sisters, Barbara and Veronica, live in Miami.) For years, he described himself, in political terms, as the “son of Cuban exiles.” “Nothing against immigrants, but my parents are exiles,” he said during his Senate campaign. “Folks that are exiles are people that have lost their country.” But in October, 2011, the Washington Post and the St. Petersburg Times reported that, according to immigration records, his family had left Cuba voluntarily, as émigrés, aboard a commercial flight, in May, 1956, more than two and a half years before Fidel Castro took power. Like many other immigrants, Rubio’s parents, Oriales and Mario, left in pursuit of jobs and opportunity. (Mario, the bartender, died in 2010.) The Post suggested that Rubio had embellished his story to gain cachet with political refugees, some of whom regard pre-Castro migrants with suspicion. Rubio called that suggestion “outrageous,” saying that he had relied on his family’s “oral history.”","3001","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s allies have defended his misstatements as an innocent error, but Guillermo Grenier, a sociologist at Florida International University, who studies the political attitudes of Cuban-Americans, told me that the explanation left many people unconvinced. “I think the dominant view is that he was misrepresenting his life story to make it more like the community he was trying to represent,” Grenier said. In a speech to the Hispanic Leadership Network, in January, 2012, Rubio said that the controversy had turned into “a blessing in disguise.” He explained, “It made me do something that we don’t do enough of. And that’s go back and discover who our parents were when they were our age.”","3002","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

When the family moved to Nevada, he immersed himself in Mormon reading, and joined the Mormon Church, along with his mother and one of his sisters. A few years later, they reëmbraced Catholicism, “mostly at my instigation,” he wrote in “An American Son.” He also recalled that he was an “inattentive and undisciplined student.”","3003","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

But he writes vividly about the most influential figure in his childhood—his maternal grandfather, Pedro Víctor García, whom he calls “my closest boyhood friend.” According to Rubio’s biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia, in 1962 García arrived from Cuba without a visa and was eventually ordered to be deported. He stayed anyway, becoming an undocumented immigrant. The Cuban missile crisis saved him; commercial air travel to Cuba was suspended, and, eventually, he was granted permanent residency. In Rubio’s recollection, his grandfather spent much of his retirement in an aluminum chair on the front porch of his daughter’s home, smoking cigars and advising Marco on the alleged perfidy of Jimmy Carter:","3004","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

Marco became an ardent supporter—making signs, blocking management’s cameras. But when the family ran low on money his father crossed the picket line. “I accused him of selling out and called him a scab,” Rubio wrote later. “It hurt him, and I’m ashamed of it.”","3005","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

The arrest added to the strain on the family. Rubio’s grade-point average at the end of his senior year was 2.1; he was allowed to graduate after attending summer school.

He arrived at an auspicious moment: newly installed term limits, inspired by a bonanza of corruption cases, were driving out senior lawmakers. He was sometimes mistaken for a clerk, but he embraced conservative doctrine—he read Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” twice in his first term—and attracted allies. Nine months later, he was the majority whip; two years later, he was the majority leader; and a year after that he was in line to be the youngest Speaker in Florida history, a post that he assumed in 2006.","3014","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

In the Bush family, however, the slogan was a tennis-court joke that George H. W. Bush used when he was preparing to serve.)

Then I’d look at them and they’d smile.” Rubio’s lieutenants proved to be problematic. Arza was forced to resign from the legislature in 2006, after he used the word “nigger” in a drunken message left on a colleague’s voice mail. He pleaded guilty to intimidating a witness and agreed to undergo alcohol and anger counselling. Rivera (who had bought a house with Rubio in Tallahassee, to use when the legislature was in session) went on to Congress but has been the target of state and federal investigations into his income and into his alleged role in supporting a shadow candidate to undercut his rival in the 2012 campaign. He has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged. The Bush campaign, in a slide presentation to donors, has cited the friendship with the “scandal-tarred” Rivera as evidence that Rubio is a “risky bet.” Rubio aides tell reporters that the candidate rarely sees Rivera anymore, but Rivera and Arza were among Rubio’s supporters at the Republican debate in Cleveland.","3016","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

In 2012, he received a contract for his memoir, worth at least eight hundred thousand dollars, and yet, even with his rising income, he cashed out sixty-eight thousand dollars from a retirement account, paying a heavy tax penalty. When reporters asked about it, he said, “My refrigerator broke down.” Political rivals wondered if he had a gambling problem, and searched for evidence but found none. Indeed, Rubio has incorporated the questions about his financial dealings into his self-narrative. “Here’s the truth,” he said, flanked by prosperous rivals, during the third Republican debate, in Boulder, Colorado. “I didn’t inherit any money.” He added, “But I’m not worried about my finances.

(After lobbying his parents to find a way to cover the tuition, he arrived to find that he hated the uniforms, the extra schoolwork, and the distance from his friends, and he pleaded to go back to public school. “I made life unbearable in our house, and within a week, my parents had relented,” he writes. “I cringe today when I remember how selfishly I behaved.”)","3021","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Drawing on the ideas of reform-minded conservatives, Rubio told the audience, “We have government policies that, quite frankly, have not allowed this economy to grow fast enough and create better-paying jobs.” He went on, “These are the impediments to upward mobility: an economy that isn’t creating better-paying jobs and a higher-education system that’s too expensive or inaccessible. And the result is we are leaving people behind.”","3022","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The crux of Rubio’s economic argument is that the poor and the middle class are facing different problems from those his parents faced. He opposes raising the minimum wage, arguing that it will lead to automation and outsourcing. He wants a greater share of young people to consider trade schools and apprenticeships instead of incurring the debts of a four-year education. “You’re going to have eighteen-year-olds in this country making fifty thousand dollars a year making cars, making seventy thousand dollars a year as a welder!” he says. (His rhapsodies about welding have been ridiculed, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median wage for welders is less than thirty-eight thousand dollars.)","3023","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio told the audience that the notion that “big government is good for the people who are trying to make it” is a “lie.” He said, “When the government dominates the economy, the people that can afford to influence the government—they win. And everybody else is stuck.” He went on, “They know that you can’t start a business out of the spare bedroom of your home if you have to fill out fifteen permits and hire lawyers and lobbyists, and they love it because that means they have no competition.”","3024","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At one point while Rubio was in the Florida House, he and David Rivera visited Washington and got in touch with Mel Martínez, who was then in the Senate. “I walked him around the Capitol, and he was like a kid with his eyes popping out, you know? ‘Oh, my gosh, this is so cool. Oh, my gosh,’ ” Martínez recalled. Within a few years, Rubio was back, with a purpose. “I invited him to lunch in the Senate dining room, and I got the definite impression that he was kind of fishing around as to if I was going to run for reëlection or not,” Martínez said. “I thought it was a bit premature to be talking about that.”","3025","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After term limits forced Rubio out of the Florida House, in 2008, he worked as a consultant for hospitals, a television pundit, and a college instructor, but by 2009 he was antsy. Martínez had announced his retirement, and Rubio wanted to challenge Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor, for the vacant Senate seat, but Party leaders had chosen Crist, and they told Rubio that they would oppose him with money and endorsements. Rubio’s friend Dennis Baxley received a text message from him: “I can’t quit thinking about U.S. Senate. They want me to do Attorney General of Florida instead, but what do you think?” Baxley said, “I texted him back. I said, ‘What does your wife think?’ She’s the spiritual depth gauge.” Jeanette approved.","3026","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio began more than thirty points behind, and almost dropped out. But he sensed that Crist was vulnerable on the right. Small, far-right rallies were gathering steam around the state; they eventually became the Tea Party. Driving around Florida in an F-150 pickup, Rubio went to rallies, and he portrayed Crist as an ally of Obama. He accentuated new priorities. Previously, progressive immigration activists had considered him an ally, because he supported tuition assistance for the children of undocumented workers and used his power to bury hard-line anti-immigration bills. But now he renounced the tuition program; he made use of the phrase “illegal aliens,” and condemned the Dream Act, which would have protected undocumented young people, as a step toward “a blanket amnesty.”","3027","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"He said that he would have supported a controversial Arizona measure that critics called the “Show me your papers” law. (Before his campaign, he had said that the law would be akin to creating a “police state.”) He also received help from Jeb Bush, who introduced him to top donors and helped him secure endorsements. He got the nomination, and won the general election by nearly twenty points. At his victory party, Bush introduced him. The Weekly Standard hailed Rubio as “the most important freshman senator.” In the Senate, Rubio maintained his opposition to the Dream Act.

"In 2012, Mitt Romney considered Rubio as a possible running mate. Democratic researchers had assembled and released an opposition-research file that focussed on Rubio’s relationship with Rivera and on the financial errors, portraying them as evidence of ineptness or profiteering. In the end, Romney chose the Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan. In materials shared with donors and reporters, the Bush campaign has alleged that Rubio was rejected because of concerns about his background. But Beth Myers, the Romney adviser who oversaw the Vice-Presidential search, told Politico last month that that is “simply wrong,” and went on, “I can say that Senator Rubio ‘passed’ our vetting and we found nothing that disqualified him from serving as VP.”","3029","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After Romney lost, the G.O.P.’s official autopsy concluded that the Party had to “embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” A small group of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate were organizing the first push for a bill that could satisfy both the left and the right, by combining a path to citizenship for eleven million undocumented immigrants with border-control measures. The group coveted Rubio’s participation, because he had both Tea Party support and Latino heritage. In December, Senator Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the No. 2 leader in the Democratic majority, encountered Rubio in the Senate gym and recruited him to what became known as the Gang of Eight. Time put him on the cover with the tagline “The Republican Savior.” He blitzed conservative media and white Evangelical audiences, arguing that border security and citizenship had to be “interwoven” in the bill. “It’s literally impossible to do one part without doing the other,” he said.","3030","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But his staff was ambivalent: his political strategists worried that it would cost him conservative support. After Rubio signed on to the bill, Glenn Beck declared, “What a piece of garbage this guy is.” But Rubio stayed with it, and when the bill reached the Senate floor, on June 27, 2013, he delivered the most powerful speech of his career, recalling that the first words that his father learned in English were “I am looking for work.” He quoted from the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, and said, “Here in America, generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass.”","3031","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The bill passed the Senate, but Rubio’s poll numbers were dropping, and he was having second thoughts. He was the only one of the eight senators who did not attend a news conference after the vote. In the weeks ahead, he walked away from the immigration bill. He told Sean Hannity, of Fox News, that repealing Obamacare was “more important” than his legislation. In October, he dismissed the bill as something “the Democrats in the Senate are demanding.” He stopped talking about immigration almost entirely. Matt Viser, of the Boston Globe, searched the Congressional Record and found that Rubio referred to immigration a hundred and thirty-five times on the Senate floor in 2013. In the next two years, he mentioned it twice. (The House never brought the bill up for a vote, and it died.)","3032","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio had come to Washington with ambitions to cut the debt, reduce spending, and curb E.P.A. rules in Florida, but none of those plans succeeded. In his first year, his only successful bill was a measure that designated September as National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month. He began losing enthusiasm for the Senate. The failure of the immigration bill hastened the process.","3033","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio had talked about running for President, but in Florida political circles few people imagined that he would run in 2016 if Bush did. “I didn’t conceive of them both deciding to compete, because the relationship goes so far back,” Baxley said. One of Rubio’s friends said he told him, “I’m not afraid of running too soon. I’m afraid of waiting too long.”","3034","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For those with strong ties to both Rubio and Bush, Rubio’s decision was discomfiting. The Miami Republican operative Al Cardenas, who gave Rubio his first job out of law school (and attended his wedding), and pushed for him to be a Vice-Presidential candidate in 2012, told Fox Latino, “I had hoped he would stay in the Senate,” adding, “It’s like running against your uncle for the president of the company.” When Rubio was asked why he did not defer to his mentor, he replied, “I didn’t know there was a line.” Asked about the sword that Bush gave him, Rubio told reporters, “I have it somewhere at home. I have young kids. I don’t want them running around with a sword.”","3035","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio announced his campaign on April 13th, at Miami’s Freedom Tower, a former newspaper building that the federal government had used in the sixties and early seventies as a Cuban-refugee center. It was nicknamed the Ellis Island of the South. Flanked by enormous American flags, he told the crowd, in a message that pointed at both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, “Yesterday is over.” At the announcement, demonstrators from Latino advocacy groups carried signs declaring “El Sueño de Rubio Es Nuestra Pesadilla” (“Rubio’s Dream Is Our Nightmare”). On “Despierta América,” the morning newscast on Univision, the host Satcha Pretto noted the presence of the protesters, and said, “Many immigrants are already asking themselves, ‘Does he want to support us or deport us?’ ”","3036","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After Rubio finished a speech one night in Las Vegas, I visited a community organizer named Leo Murrieta, who founded the Center for Latino Prosperity, a nonpartisan nonprofit that conducts research and advocacy. Barrel-chested and bearded, he wore a cardigan and rectangular glasses. Murrieta, who is twenty-nine, has heard Rubio tell his story over the years; he flashed a smile and said of himself, “My dad was a dishwasher and my mom was a housekeeper.”","3037","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"He was born in Mexico while his parents and three siblings were en route to the United States. A church helped them get green cards and allowed them to sleep in the pews for three years until they had saved enough for an apartment in a poor section of Las Vegas. “My parents would go without food. I don’t remember buying new shoes when I was a kid. But I think a lot of people go through that, in different ways.” He learned English from “Sesame Street.” “So I was the family translator until I was eight.” His older brother found work bagging groceries, and the family moved to West Las Vegas, another troubled part of town.","3038","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Murrieta became a naturalized citizen in 2010—“my American birthday,” he calls it. “It was the most beautiful moment of my life. And I registered to vote literally the moment after that, because all I ever wanted to do was vote.” In 2013, he worked nationally on immigration reform and labor issues. “I was blessed to be able to be in a lot of the rooms where policy was being discussed.” He said that Latinos would be receptive to a Republican message, but he thinks that the LIBRE Initiative promotes the interests of big business rather than the interests of the community.","3039","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked what he made of Rubio’s work on immigration reform. “He was for it before he was against it,” he said. “I’m an immigrant kid from the poorest parts of Vegas, and my family is touched by every form of immigration.” His brother-in-law and sister-in-law are undocumented. “This bill would have saved my family a lot of fear. You know, we still live in fear that our family is going to be torn apart.” He went on, “I’ve seen Marco Rubio give us lip service. I’ve seen him and his staff say that they support us. But then, when the spotlight is put on them, they don’t have the muscle to stand. And that’s not what we need in a President. We need someone who can stand up and stay true to what he’s said.” He added, “One of us has forgotten where we came from.”","3040","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The more we talked, the more dispirited Murrieta became about the state of the immigration debate in America. The Obama Administration’s executive actions, announced in 2014, would have shielded members of his family against the threat of deportation, but then a court ruling blocked that protection. His mother called him in panic. “She asked me, ‘Qué quiere decir?’—‘What does it mean?’ ”","3041","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

That’s ludicrous.” Of Rubio, she said, “He walked away from comprehensive immigration reform.” She added, “A measure of his viability is in how he is able to reconcile both his party’s demands and his natural inclinations.”","3042","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The Reverend Samuel Rodriguez is the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, which represents more than forty thousand evangelical congregations. He gave a benediction at the last Republican National Convention. He told me, “Let me really take the filters off: Marco Rubio’s de-facto one-eighty on immigration after the Gang of Eight failed was nothing other than a mistake. It was a serious mistake, and, I would argue, an ethical miscalculation.” Since then, however, Rodriguez has decided to give Rubio another chance. “I believe Senator Marco Rubio learned his lesson,” he said.","3043","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"A Gallup poll released in August found that among Hispanic voters Bush has a net favorability rating of eleven points; Rubio trails him, with five points. Clinton’s net favorability with Hispanics is forty points. But when I asked Lionel Sosa, Reagan’s Latino outreach director, how he thought Rubio would do with Hispanics in a general election, he said that although he had heard the criticisms, he thought they would fade. “The first Latino that has a chance to become President?

"It was, perhaps, inevitable that Marco Rubio would open the deepest cut in the troubled campaign of Jeb Bush. For days before the third Republican debate, the Bush campaign had been criticizing Rubio for missing Senate votes this year. During the debate, Bush sensed an opportunity and turned to face his former protégé. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,” Bush said. “I mean, literally, the Senate—what is it, like, a French work week?” He delivered the line awkwardly, like a principal making a cameo appearance in a school play.","3045","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio stared at him evenly. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s vote record,” he said, and added, pityingly, “The only reason why you’re doing it now is because we’re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.” Applause rose from the audience. The phrase “Someone has convinced you” was lethal. Bush—suddenly in the role of the misled, desperate old pol—smiled wanly and tried to speak, but Rubio turned to face the camera. “My campaign is going to be about the future of America—it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage,” he said. “I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.” It sounded like a eulogy.","3046","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The next day, Rubio appeared on six network- and cable-news shows and attracted three-quarters of a million dollars in donations online. Then came the mother lode. On October 30th, Paul Singer, the hedge-fund billionaire, who donated more money to Republican candidates and causes last year than anyone else in America, sent a letter to dozens of donors, encouraging them to help raise money for Rubio, calling him “perfect for this moment” and the best choice to “navigate this complex primary process, and still be in a position to defeat Secretary Clinton in November 2016.” Rubio had been courting Singer for weeks.","3047","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"A few days later, I met Rubio for breakfast in New York, at a restaurant in the Hyatt in Times Square. He arrived at seven-thirty, with two staff members, and slid into the booth. He ordered a cappuccino, and then called after the waitress, “Can I get a double shot of espresso in it?” He looked tired. He was trying to maintain a semblance of a routine: six hours of sleep, a gym visit for “anything that gets your heart rate up for thirty minutes,” a morning call to his kids on the way to school, and an uninterrupted block of time at home with his family on Sundays.","3048","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

"I suspected he might have more difficulty defusing concern that he is becoming indebted to powerful donors—some of the very same “people that can afford to influence the government,” whom he disparaged in his speech at St. Christopher. More than four in five Americans—an equal share of Republicans and Democrats—believe that money plays too large a role in political campaigns, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released in June. While Rubio was getting help from Singer, and perhaps Adelson, a nonprofit group called the Conservative Solutions Project—which, by law, can conceal the identities of its donors—was running millions of dollars’ worth of ads promoting him, more than any similar group devoted to a Presidential candidate.","3050","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio if he thinks Americans will worry that he is beholden to big backers. He shook his head, and said, “I’ve never had a single donor come to me and say, ‘I’ll support you, but only if you support this initiative.’ ” I said that sounded like a false standard, an unrealistic description of political influence. He continued, “People may not believe this, but the vast majority of big donors in America don’t really ask a lot of government—at least on our side of the aisle. What they really, largely, want is to be treated fairly and be left alone.” He added, “I’ve never changed any item on my agenda in search of a supporter.”","3051","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"On several issues, Rubio has taken a position that suits the faithful in the primaries but is guaranteed to repel voters in a general election. His most obvious vulnerability is on abortion. In the first Republican debate, Rubio said that his opposition to abortion extends to cases of rape or incest—a position at odds with that of more than three-quarters of Americans. Axelrod told me, “No exceptions is a position so extreme that no Republican candidate has ever held it. Presidential races are defined by moments. Maybe he will try to amend that position, but in the age of video it’s hard to extinguish a declarative statement like that.” When I asked Rubio about it, he said, somewhat confusingly, “Look, I personally believe that all life is worthy of protection, and therefore I don’t ever require, nor have I ever advocated, that I won’t support a law unless it has exceptions.” After some more twists and turns, I sensed that we had reached the line he plans to use in a general election: “My goal is to save as many lives as possible, and I’ll support anything that does that. Even if it has exceptions.”","3052","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"During the third debate, he had said that it was time to end an immigration system based largely on family ties. “That’s the way my parents came, legally, in 1956, but in 2015 we have a very different economy. Our legal-immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.” I told him that people have said that he is, in effect, pulling up the ladder after his family has reached safety.","3053","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"“I understand the argument,” he said, but he thought it was unfair. “In 1956, two people with barely any command of English, who had no formal education of any sort, were able to find jobs. In the twenty-first century, those jobs are scarce. . . . So I don’t think, for the country, it makes sense to continue to allow people to immigrate here in large numbers who we know do not have the skills or the education they need to succeed economically. It’s just a change based on new economic reality.”","3054","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked what he thought would have happened to his parents if they had faced the system he is proposing. “It’s not clear what would have happened to them,” he said. “We can all get into hypotheticals about what would have happened two hundred years ago, or one hundred years ago, or fifty years ago, when somebody’s relatives came, but the world changes, and our policy has to keep pace with that.” He seemed dissatisfied with that answer, and went on, “Unlike most of the other people running, I live surrounded by immigration. My family are all immigrants. My kids go to school with kids who are immigrants. So this is not a theoretical issue for me. I live it personally. And it is hard. You know the stories of people that are here illegally, but it’s heartbreaking, because they came because they don’t want their daughter to be abducted by a drug gang in Central America. But the flip side of it is, every country in the world has immigration laws. And America has to have immigration laws, and if you don’t enforce them you don’t have laws. So this notion that somehow to be compassionate you have to be lawless is something I don’t buy, and I think most Hispanics don’t buy it.”","3055","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign faces a range of tactical questions—Does he have the organization to win an early state? Will he lose his home state to Trump? Could Cruz win with only conservative and evangelical voters?—but the larger question will be harder to solve: Rubio has succeeded in politics by straddling as many positions as possible. He is the Catholic at the Protestant church, the quarterback of both teams, the joven viejo. But it isn’t clear that he can continue to do that and also be as bold as he would need to be to alter the Presidential prospects of the Republican Party in a changing country.","3056","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

"If Rubio makes it to the general election, some of his positions are unlikely to budge. Hillary Clinton favors an activist American foreign policy, and Rubio mentioned to me that he was rereading “The Last Lion,” by William Manchester. He said, “It’s this book about Churchill. It’s really long. Only because I’m just so fascinated by the leadership he provided.” He went on, “Churchill was a guy who was largely ignored through much of the thirties as a warmonger, and a guy that was crying wolf, and Chamberlain was this heroic figure that was going to achieve peace in our time by diplomacy. And I think, in many cases, we’re kind of at a similar moment, where many of us, including myself, are warning about dangers that are percolating around the world and what they could turn into.

"In retrospect, those were the final moments of a phase in the Presidential campaign: when Islamic State militants assaulted Paris on November 13th, the candidates lurched away from talk of taxes and Wall Street regulations to face questions of national security. Jeb Bush, after straining, for months, to distance himself from his brother’s invasion of Iraq, said, “We should declare war” on the Islamic State, and called for the deployment of American troops “without their hands tied.” In a Democratic debate on the day after the attacks, Clinton said that the Islamic State “cannot be contained—it must be defeated.” She declined to identify the threat as “radical Islam,” saying that the term was “painting with too broad a brush” and risked alienating allies in the Muslim world.","3059","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio held up that point as a flawed gesture of diplomacy. “I don’t understand it,” he said on ABC’s “This Week,” the next day. “That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren’t violent themselves.” It was a shrewd reply—the cool placement of safety over diplomacy—that nevertheless avoided Bush’s sharp turn toward war.","3060","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But in reaching for a broad rhetorical vision Rubio presaged an instinct for aggressive intervention.“This is a clash of civilizations,” he told ABC. “There is no middle ground on this. Either they win or we win.” It was the politics of absolutes, a vocabulary that harks back to the with-us-or-against-us logic of an earlier era. Even George W. Bush disavowed the clash-of-civilizations argument. Rubio stopped short of specifying how many troops he wants to send to the Middle East, but he left no doubt that he believes such action is unavoidable. In an article that Rubio wrote for Politico, he said that the United States should “provide direct military support to Sunnis and the Kurds if Baghdad fails to support them.” He also called for no-fly zones in Syria, for grounding Bashar al-Assad’s Air Force, and for the establishment of “safe zones” to “stem the flow of refugees and provide a place to train and arm rebel fighters.” He said that he would “oppose Russia and Iran” in their efforts to buttress Assad’s regime.","3061","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In one of our conversations, I asked Rubio if his instinct for intervention was out of step with a generation that is exhausted by war and confrontation, young men and women who have come of age in the years since September 11th. He responded instantly: “We’re not Luxembourg. We’re the United States of America—the highest-profile, most important, most influential country in the world.” He went on, “And we may ignore problems that exist far away, but those problems don’t ignore us. America, in the world today, is the only nation capable of convening collective action.”","3062","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Barely two months before the first Iowa caucus, the debates about national security and immigration were converging in ways that Rubio seemed well positioned to exploit. In the days after the Paris attacks, more than thirty governors said that their states would resist the resettlement of Syrian refugees. Rubio, as he so often does, found a way to embrace two sides of a painful question, expressing both empathy and tough-mindedness. He said of the refugees, “It’s not that we don’t want to—it’s that we can’t.” ♦","3063","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

The resulting report is a bracingly forthright piece of self-criticism that took the G.O.P. to task for turning off young voters, minorities, and women. A key finding was that candidates needed to curb the harsh talk about immigration. Mitt Romney’s call for “self-deportation” was loser rhetoric. Making people feel that “a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States” was poor politics. The report offered one specific policy recommendation: “We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.

Rubio’s parents were born in Cuba, as was Cruz’s father. But Cruz, a Tea Party conservative and a Southern Baptist, isn’t exactly an avatar of Latino cultural identity. When he does embrace that identity, it tends to be awkward, as when he told a meeting of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce last spring, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Hispanic panhandler. And the reason is in our community it would be shameful to be begging on the street.” Rubio is at ease invoking the experience of his immigrant parents—his father was a bartender, his mother a maid—and sometimes gives interviews in Spanish, though he has had to defend the practice against attacks from Trump. Bush has a bicultural family. But all three have moved to the unwelcoming right on immigration.","3066","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"In 2013, Rubio sponsored a bipartisan bill to create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living here, but he renounced it and now says that we “can’t even have a conversation” about the fate of the undocumented until the borders are secured. Cruz has endorsed eliminating automatic birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented parents. Bush is still willing to grant citizenship to some undocumented immigrants, if they meet a long list of conditions. But this summer he released a six-point plan that stresses the need for a military-style fortification of the border.","3067","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"All three also differ with majorities of Latino voters on other issues. Most Latino voters support stricter gun control and a higher minimum wage, and most say that climate change matters to them personally and that the federal government needs to act on it. Moreover, any assumption that Latino voters—a very diverse group—can be relied upon to choose Latino candidates regardless of their positions is not supported by evidence. In Texas in 2012, when Cruz ran for the Senate, about sixty per cent of the Latino vote went to his opponent, a white Democrat.","3068","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"In the primary season candidates often say things that make trouble for their party in the general election. We’re likely to see an extreme version of that phenomenon this time, above all in battleground states like Colorado, Nevada, and North Carolina, where the winner will need to carry the minority vote. Trump’s anti-immigrant sloganeering and his rivals’ scramble to keep up with it won’t be easy to forget. In 2012, Romney got just twenty-three per cent of the Latino vote. In 2016, the Republican candidate will need to get twice that, according to a recent analysis made by the political scientists David Damore and Matt Barreto. That’s because the Latino share of the electorate has been growing. By 2050, the Latino population in the U.S. is projected to be twenty-nine per cent, up from seventeen per cent today. Republican candidates have often told themselves they have more of a chance of winning Hispanic voters than black voters, finding common ground on social issues. “Republicans often seem to think if they could just get beyond immigration issues there’d be all kinds of opportunities for them with Latino voters,” John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron, says. “That’s a little like saying if we could just get beyond civil rights we’d be good with black voters.”","3069","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"Last month, at a candidates’ forum in Plano, Texas, the conservative activist Ralph Reed proposed a strategy that ignores the issue altogether: Republicans should just focus on the evangelical vote, which, he claimed, is “larger than the African-American vote, the Latino vote, the feminist vote, the gay vote, and the union vote combined.” He was resurrecting a popular G.O.P. theory that President Obama was reëlected only because millions of conservative, and especially evangelical, voters went “missing” in 2012. All the 2016 Republican nominee has to do is get those voters to return to the polls. Green finds the “missing” theory unlikely—evangelicals tend to be motivated, reliable voters—and Karl Rove himself dismissed it in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled “The Myth of the Stay-at-Home Republicans.” But the strategy seems particularly problematic in its willingness to dismiss whole segments of the population—precisely what the 2012 postmortem advised against.","3070","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"Before the start of last month’s debate, representatives from conservative Latino groups gathered in Boulder to issue some warnings about what would happen if the Party didn’t distance itself from extreme immigration politics. Their message was of a piece with the 2012 report, but even more blunt. Rosario Marin, who served as the U.S. Treasurer under President George W. Bush, said, “Don’t expect us to come to your side during the general election. You are not with us now, we will not be with you then. You don’t have our vote now, you won’t have it then. You insult us now, we will be deaf to you then.” In the meantime—and no doubt especially at next month’s debate in Nevada, a state that is nearly thirty per cent Latino—they will be listening carefully. ♦","3071","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/harsh-talk"
"This week, David Bowers, the Democratic mayor of Roanoke, Virginia, invoked the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War as justification for keeping out Iraqi and Syrian refugees. I wonder if the mayor (who later apologized to anyone he might have offended) would have paused for one second in his headlong rush to join the anti-refugee hysteria sweeping America if he’d known that, among the residents of his city, there’s an Iraqi named Hayder. In 2003, Hayder was working as an interpreter for the 82nd Airborne Division, in Baghdad, when his convoy was ambushed by insurgents. Dragging an American sergeant out of the line of fire, Hayder was hit in both legs and nearly killed. He lost most of his right leg. Unable to work and in danger for his life, he fled Iraq with his wife and son to Jordan, where the family languished for years in deepening misery while getting nowhere in their efforts to get visas to the United States. Finally, in 2007, his case came to the attention of Kirk Johnson, an American refugee advocate, and the next year Hayder and his family were resettled in Roanoke. In 2013, he became a U.S. citizen.","November 20, 2015","3072","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"Mayor Bowers hasn’t tried to have the family interned, not yet anyway, though the logic of his statement could have led him there—for keeping Muslim refugees out doesn’t solve the problem of the ones already here. (Donald Trump, tossing out answers that move beyond U.S. history to that of Nazi Germany, is talking about imposing mandatory registration on all Muslims in this country.) A bill that overwhelmingly passed the House on Thursday, by a vote of 289–137, with the support of fifty Democrats, would require the director of the F.B.I., the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the director of National Intelligence all to certify that each refugee applicant from Iraq or Syria poses no threat to the United States before being admitted. According to Betsy Fisher of the International Refugee Assistance Project, this group includes fifty-eight thousand Iraqis who have applied for resettlement through a program known as Direct Access, which was created by Congress for Iraqis who can show that they worked with the United States government or with American companies, non-profits, or media outlets. If it had the chance, the Islamic State would slaughter every one of them. The same goes for the many Yazidis applying for resettlement from Iraq—members of a religious minority who have been rounded up, enslaved, and murdered by ISIS. It’s already very, very hard for people like them to get here. Iraqis and Syrians are probably the most heavily vetted refugees in the history of the world. If three top government officials are going to be required to put their names and reputations on every admission, the very, very hard will become just about impossible. The House is counting on political cowardice and bureaucratic indifference to advance the cause of irrationality and bigotry.","3073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"We’ve seen this kind of frenzied meanness during past crises, real or perceived. It hit the country in the form of the Palmer raids after the First World War, with the internment camps during the Second World War (Franklin Roosevelt’s most shameful act), and in the McCarthyite politics of the nineteen-fifties. Such moments were made for Ted Cruz—this generation’s Joe McCarthy. Not to be outdone by the House, on Thursday he introduced a bill in the Senate called the Terrorist Refugee Infiltration Prevention Act. It would add refugees from Libya, Yemen, and Somalia to the Syrians and Iraqis on what is effectively a black list. (There was no explanation for the absence of Afghanistan, Mali, and Nigeria as potential sources of Terrorist Refugee Infiltration.)","3074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"Cruz’s bill would allow two exceptions to the barred door. One is for individuals who have provided “substantial assistance” to the U.S.—though the bill would require certification from the leaders of four government agencies that it was “a level of assistance without which the United States could not achieve the purposes for which the assistance was provided or sought.” This tortured language raises the already-high barrier and would keep out pretty much every last Iraqi, of any faith, who lost his leg or his safety or his future while helping Americans in his country. The second exception, Cruz explained, is for “Christians, Yazidis, small minorities that are facing genocide.” This is a back-door way of legislating a religious test for refugees, by exploiting a powerful word that didn’t seem to move Cruz when it mattered. Last year, after Yazidis were rounded up, executed, and enslaved by the Islamic State, Cruz voted against a bill that gave President Barack Obama authority and funds to fight the organization.","3075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"
"President Obama has been admirable in refusing to give in to this stampede.

"A lot of people in this country are disgracing themselves this week. They include politicians of both parties—though many more Republicans than Democrats—and all regions. Their motives vary: deep-seated bigotry, unreasoning fear, spinelessness, opportunism, or some unholy mix of them all. During the House hearings, Republicans kept demanding guarantees of absolute security. “I haven’t heard a single one of you say there’s no risk,” Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told Administration witnesses. There’s no such thing as no risk. Parisians could stop going out to cafés, Germans could turn back every single Syrian at the border, Americans could stop admitting anyone as a refugee, and there would still be risks. It’s absurd, and infantilizing, to demand that our officials promise to keep us absolutely safe. We don’t live that way, nor should we. Instead, we have to find the balance between safety and a decent life in a free society during an age of terror. Like every compromise, it will leave us unsatisfied.

"On Thursday night, as the House was passing its anti-refugee bill, I moderated a panel at New York University with four women who were visiting from Syria. I wish Ted Cruz, Trey Gowdy, and other panic-stricken demagogues had been in the audience. One of the Syrians, a journalist named Zaina Erhaim, screened four short films she’s made about women going about their lives in Aleppo, Syria, which is one of the least safe places in the world. Two of her subjects were on the panel—Ahed and Zein. They both work for international relief agencies in Aleppo, distributing bread and bandaging the wounded. Zein also teaches small children in a school that is literally underground. A fourth woman, Rafea, works as an activist and writer in Damascus. All four are from Sunni Muslim families, though Rafea is a self-described atheist; Ahed and Zein wore the hijab. To get to New York, Ahed had to spend several nights in the mountains outside Aleppo, since the Turkish border crossing is closed and the roads aren’t safe. Asked what she wants from Americans, Erhaim, the filmmaker, said an end to air attacks on cities, and a safe zone for civilians along the border. All of the women said that they no longer have any hope for Syria, but all of them are going back there.","3078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/our-betrayal-of-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees"

"When Jeb Bush launched his campaign for President, in June, most of the attention paid to his political branding focussed on his folksy logo, which featured his first name alone, in Target red, followed by an exclamation point. But, at the same time, Bush also débuted his campaign’s hashtag, #AllInForJeb, which serves as his digital message, rallying cry, and women’s vintage-T-shirt slogan. With it, Bush, the former governor of Florida, was asking his volunteers to go “all in” in support of his candidacy, and suggesting by association that, in contrast with his previous flirtations with running for the White House, he would be fully engaged with the task this time, too.","September 7, 2015","3080","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"In American usage, the phrase “all in” began as a colloquial expression meaning to be in a bad spot—exhausted, worn out, and spent. In the game of poker, it refers to the moment when a player—whether out of bravado, recklessness, or desperation—bets all of his or her chips on a single hand. Thanks to the Texas Hold’em craze of the nineteen-nineties and two thousands, and the public’s appetite for new forms of dramatic hyperbole, the poker version of the phrase crossed over to general use and, along the way, became denuded to the point of near meaninglessness. Whereas “all in” once referred to a scenario in which someone either wins a hand or loses everything in a flash, now it means that a person is simply generally enthusiastic or fully committed. It’s everywhere these days—business jargon, marketing catch phrases, sports mantras, and the idioms of religion and self-help.","3081","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"The all-in moment in poker is a thrilling win-or-lose-everything crisis of dramatic clarity: you’ve wagered all you’ve got, giving your fate over to the cards, and you can’t go back out again. Going all in is often a spectacularly bad idea. But in life, it seems, it is all good—the only way to live boldly is to be all in on many different things at once.","3082","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"“All in” has become especially popular in the language of politics. It’s the title of Chris Hayes’s talk show on MSNBC and Paula Broadwell’s ill-fated biography of David Petraeus, the former director of the C.I.A. The phrase gets tossed into headlines every time a politician decides to try to do something. In just the past year, President Obama has been said to have been all in on free trade, climate change, and criminal-justice reform. In April, the Washington Post reported that Hillary Clinton had gone “all-in on gay marriage.” In May, Clinton was, according to MSNBC, going “all in on immigration reform.” In July, Fusion said that Bernie Sanders was going “all-in on the $15 minimum wage.” A few weeks ago, Salon argued that Donald Trump had gone “all in on right’s latest insanity.” More recently, NBC News announced that Jeb Bush, true to his hashtag promise, was planning to go “all in against Donald Trump.” In Iowa, Bush was asked by a reporter if he really was all in on the caucuses there. Yes, Bush said, he was all in.","3083","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"None of these statements, of course, are true. Modern politicians have not, all of a sudden and all at once, become incredible risk-takers—betting their entire legacies or campaigns on a particular issue or strategy. It’s difficult to think of any moment in history when a politician has actually gone all in. (Though it’s probably safe to say that Abraham Lincoln went all in on restoring the Union.) If Hillary Clinton’s policy on immigration or Bernie Sanders’s support of a higher minimum wage turn out to be unpopular with voters, they won’t suddenly have to quit the race. Jeb Bush won’t drop out if he loses in Iowa. And the stakes of the election for Bush are several notches below his campaign’s rhetoric. If he loses, he’ll go back to sitting on corporate boards and being the son of one President and the brother of another.","3084","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"Many of poker’s words and phrases are tinged with a kind of roguish romance and drama that we hope may rub off on the more mundane activities of normal life—upping the ante, stacking the deck, calling a bluff, putting your cards on the table. In terms of politics, there is an obvious benefit, for both elected officials and the people who cover them, in making the business of government sound more dangerous or dashing than it really is—riskier and more headless, more heroic, more “mavericky.” Politicians become prizefighters or gunslingers or gamblers; elections are fights or showdowns or high-stakes card games. “All in” makes every event sound like a decisive, dramatic turning point that provides instant, unambiguous resolution. But politics isn’t really like a poker game. And neither is life. As a phrase, “all in” is troublesome because it is almost always just an exaggeration, if not an outright falsehood. The free-climber Alex Honnold goes all in when he climbs vertical rock faces without a rope. Jeb Bush and the rest of us are doing something else.","3085","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"In poker, being all in is a lonely place to be. But elsewhere, “all in” is used to evoke inclusiveness and community, as in, “we’re all in this together.” In 2006, when Alex Rodriguez wanted to assure Yankees fans that the team was serious about winning, he said, “To use a poker term, we’re all in. This is the most urgent we’ve been. It’s going to be exciting.” (The Yanks didn’t win the World Series that season, but the players still got paid and weren’t compelled to retire.) The phrase was still unusual enough that Rodriguez felt the need to offer a bit of context. By now, it has joined the ignoble ranks of the sports cliché. Last spring, as the Cleveland Cavaliers began their playoff run in the N.B.A., fans were exhorted to go all in for LeBron James and their home-town team, which in turn would go all in for them. Cleveland was a family, drawn together and dreaming big. Let’s hope that there weren’t many gamblers in Cleveland who took the suggestion seriously and bet the farm on the Cavs in the Finals. They lost in six games to the Golden State Warriors.","3086","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"For Bush, #AllInForJeb suggests that same idea of community, of people coming together for a common purpose. But, right now, it appears that Bush is all in all by himself. As he languishes in single digits among the Republican field following a few months of tepid campaigning, it is difficult to picture some young volunteer out there putting everything on the line to help elect the third member of the Bush family to the White House. As the Times put it in a recent editorial, “Mr. Bush has been angering to many, boring to many others, inspiring to none.” It is hard to think of a candidate who is, at this point, less in than Jeb Bush. If the trouble continues, he might need to take courage from his campaign hashtag, and really try something desperate.","3087","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"

Maybe you’re not sure whether Kermit would really call Miss Piggy “sexy”—Muppet sex being something you’ve never had to ponder before now.

"That being done, you have to get down to business. Two episodes of “The Muppets” have aired, but even before that there were signs that this wasn’t your mother’s “Muppet Show.” Over the summer, as part of a cheeky marketing campaign, the “news” broke that Kermit and Miss Piggy had split up, and that Kermit was now seeing a younger pig, Denise. In the pilot, Kermit explains, “What can I tell you? I’m attracted to pigs.” (A future Prime Minister?) (Sorry.) In the same episode, Fozzie talks about his dating foibles: “When your online profile says, ‘Passionate bear looking for love,’ you get a lot of wrong responses.” And Kermit describes his life as “bacon-wrapped hell on Earth.” In the second episode, Zoot draws a penis on a greeting card, and Miss Piggy sleeps with Josh Groban. (Both, thank goodness, are off-camera.)","3090","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"The show is itself bacon-wrapped in a clever premise: Miss Piggy is the host of a late-night talk show, Kermit is her beleaguered producer, and the rest of the Muppets comprise her terrorized staff: sort of a felt “Larry Sanders Show.” The series is shot in the mockumentary style of “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” a contemporary spin on the original “Muppet Show,” which mirrored variety television. Also like its predecessor, “The Muppets” makes good use of celebrity cameos—kudos to whoever thought Reza Aslan would have chemistry with Miss Piggy, because (surprise) he did. And, as TV’s only female talk-show host, Miss Piggy is given the status and ambition she deserves.","3091","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"But the off-color humor seems badly misplaced, as if the show’s creators were trying to beat “Crank Yankers” and “Avenue Q” at their own game. With the exception of Gonzo, the Muppets should not work blue. The problem isn’t that the Muppets should appeal solely to children; Muppets humor has always been sophisticated and self-knowing, a “gateway drug to comedy,” as Jason Segel, the ultimate Muppets superfan, put it. The 2011 film “The Muppets,” which Segel wrote with Nick Stoller, nailed the absurdist tone that had eluded the franchise post-Henson: at once antic, self-referential, and heartfelt. Kids could revel in the anarchic (Gonzo as a toilet magnate), while nostalgists could smirk at the jokes that flew over their children’s heads (Animal in anger management). But the funniest bits were funny for everyone—the villain saying the line “Maniacal laugh!” instead of maniacally laughing—because absurdism, done right, cuts through the age gap. This was a lesson that Segel and Stoller took from the “classic” Muppets films, especially “The Great Muppet Caper.” What’s funnier than John Cleese dryly informing his wife of a “pig climbing up the outside of the house”? Or Miss Piggy, stranded on the side of the road, watching a motorcycle fly from the back a moving truck and remarking to the camera, “What an unbelievable coincidence”?","3092","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"Not that the Muppets are strangers to innuendo. Charles Grodin’s lust for Miss Piggy, in “The Great Muppet Caper,” is legitimately steamy—though it’s never implied that they actually have sex. What the new show misjudges isn’t some kind of moral standard but what makes the Muppets funny in the first place. They exist in the rude, recognizable world of adult humans but are too innocent to notice. It’s funny, in a cheap way, to joke about Zoot being in Alcoholics Anonymous. (“It’s not that kind of meeting,” he’s told in the pilot.) But it’s a lot funnier when Fozzie, at a London nightspot in “The Great Muppet Caper,” says of his champagne, “You know, if you put enough sugar in this stuff, it tastes just like ginger ale!” Maybe that’s the recipe for Muppets humor: take champagne and add sugar. Not salt.","3093","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"It’s a testament to Jim Henson and Frank Oz that the Muppets sensibility has been so tricky to get right without them. After Henson died, in 1990, the brand languished for years under various owners, and its reëmergence has been a welcome consequence of our current mania for rebooting. (As the writer Pixie Casey tweeted, “Racist Atticus Finch and Midlife Crisis Kermit are exactly what we deserve for our collective inability to let go of things.”) Scores of think pieces accompanied the Kermit-Piggy breakup, including one on Miss Piggy as a domestic abuser (though most often she used her karate skills to thump bad guys). The Muppets revival has even brought on an academic volume, “Jim Henson and Philosophy,” with entries on “Fraggle Rock and Post-Structuralism” and “The Metaphysics of Muppetationality.”","3094","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"What is Muppetationality, anyway? To me, it’s a haven for eccentricity, where even “whatevers” like Gonzo have a place. And it’s a style of humor that can work on multiple levels, winking differently at the same fans as the decades pass. So, to those who have been given temporary custody of the Muppets legacy, I ask this: dig deeper, handle with care, and keep it PG.","3095","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"

"In the week since the attacks on Paris, there has been a great deal of talk about waging war on the Islamic State, but scant clarity about how such a war might succeed. In a season when the improvisations of Vladimir Putin shape geopolitics, and those of Donald Trump shape American politics (Trump has remarked that Putin is “getting an A” for leadership), it is perhaps unsurprising that public discourse about what comes next has been informed by opportunism and incoherence. Yet even the sober, often stirring rhetoric of the French President, François Hollande, has often elided the main problem, which involves aligning aims with realistic means. “France is at war,” Hollande told his parliament last week, as French jets struck Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State’s self-declared capital.

Fearon, a political scientist at Stanford, published a study, “Why Do Some Civil Wars Last So Much Longer Than Others?,” in which he and a colleague analyzed scores of civil wars fought between 1945 and 1999. Some of the findings were intuitive: civil wars end quickly when one side has a decisive military advantage over the other; poor countries with natural resources to export often have long internal wars, because whoever controls the resources also controls the national treasury. Other findings were novel, such as the fact that wars following coups d’état tend to be short. In another study, “Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War,” Fearon and the political scientist David D. Laitin discovered that even though in nations with exceptional ethnic pluralism, like Syria and Iraq, lines of conflict may be defined by ethnic identity, pluralism itself is not a notable predictor of civil war; poverty is a much more significant factor.","3099","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/isis-after-paris"
"Rereading these works in light of the infuriating problem of the Islamic State, two discouraging findings stand out. In 1945, many civil wars were concluded after about two years. By 1999, they lasted, on average, about sixteen years. And conflicts in which a guerrilla group could finance itself—by selling contraband drug crops, or by smuggling oil—might go on for thirty or forty years.

This has been true even when the guerrilla forces were weak: the Taliban possesses neither planes nor significant anti-aircraft missiles, yet it has fought the United States to a stalemate, and the advantage is now shifting in its favor.","3102","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/isis-after-paris"
"If President Obama ordered the Marines into urgent action, they could be waving flags of liberation in Raqqa by New Year’s. But, after taking the region, killing scores of isis commanders as well as Syrian civilians, and flushing surviving fighters and international recruits into the broken, ungoverned cities of Syria and Iraq’s Sunni heartland, then what? Without political coöperation from Bashar al-Assad, Russia, Iran, Hezbollah, Iraqi Shiite militias, Turkey, the Al Qaeda ally Al Nusra, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and others, the Marines (and the French or nato allies that might assist them) would soon become targets for a mind-bogglingly diverse array of opponents.","3103","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/isis-after-paris"
"Syrian rebels overwhelmingly regard Assad’s regime as their main enemy, and for good reason: his forces have killed more Syrians than anyone else has. In the absence of a political agreement with Assad or his removal from office, it is impossible to conceive of a Muslim-majority occupation force that would be able and willing to keep the peace after the Marines departed. Some may argue that it would be worthwhile, nonetheless, to wipe out the Islamic State on the ground and deal with the fallout later. After Paris, such an approach may hold emotional appeal. After Afghanistan and Iraq, however, it is not a responsible course of action.","3104","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/isis-after-paris"
"Analyses like James Fearon’s suggest that there are perhaps two ways to end, or at least to contain, long wars. One is to accept that success will be a long time coming, and to adopt a posture of military and diplomatic patience and persistence. That may yet lead to the farc’s disarmament. The other is to negotiate aggressively to form international alliances, which will allow for a rapid, decisive use of force on the ground. The European Union activated a mutual-defense compact after the Paris attacks; nato could broaden the alliance by invoking Article 5 of its treaty, as it did after 9/11. Such coalitions can be swiftly effective. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, George H. W. Bush and James Baker pulled together an unexpected military alliance to force his retreat. In Afghanistan, George W. Bush overthrew the Taliban with worldwide support. Both actions eliminated the immediate threat, but neither resolved the targeted country’s underlying instability, or assured durable international security. (On Friday, Islamist terrorists staged a murderous raid on a hotel in Mali’s capital, Bamako, almost three years after the French-led intervention in that country.)","3105","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/isis-after-paris"
"Barack Obama has all but ruled out a ground intervention in Syria or Iraq. Instead, last week he promised “an intensification” of the strategy he is already pursuing: Special Forces raids, air strikes, and diplomatic conferences to try to resolve the Syrian war, perhaps by declaring ceasefires or insuring Putin’s coöperation. “A political solution is the only way to end the war in Syria and unite the Syrian people and the world” against the Islamic State, the President said. Unfortunately, right now that looks no more realistic than a prolonged American occupation of Raqqa. Obama’s caution in the Middle East since the Arab Spring is a reminder that there are perhaps as many risks attendant upon inaction as upon action. The dilemmas suggested by Fearon’s research won’t evaporate; they will be on the desk of Obama’s successor. ♦","3106","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/isis-after-paris"
"On the evening of July 12, 2007, at the end of a Presidential candidates’ forum hosted by the N.A.A.C.P., in Detroit, John Edwards loped across the stage to Hillary Clinton and whispered in her ear. Her microphone, which apparently hadn’t been turned off, caught him saying something about the approaching fall, and then, more clearly, “We should try to have a more serious…smaller group.” Clinton, in a canary-yellow pantsuit, nodded, and added to the lament:","November 3, 2015","3107","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"

"The idea that “our guys should talk” and do something—anything—to bring order to a chaotic field of candidates may hold some attraction for the Republican Party this time around. There has been amazement that the field still stands at fourteen (or sixteen, if you count broadly). When the exchange between Clinton and Edwards took place, the Democrats had eight candidates, and that seemed like a lot, even though it was four months earlier in the cycle than it is now. In thinking about why the Republicans’ numbers have somehow not been winnowed, and the possible risks in forcing that question, the Edwards-Clinton exchange is instructive, too.","3110","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"At the time of the forum, Clinton was in first place in the polls, with numbers in the high thirties, and Edwards was in third, polling in the teens. They were both “serious”: Clinton was a senator and a former First Lady; Edwards was a former senator and the 2004 Vice-Presidential candidate (he hadn’t yet lapsed into National Enquirer absurdity). In between them, in second place and polling in the twenties, was freshman Senator Barack Obama, followed by a single-digit panoply of Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, and, not quite registering statistically, Mike Gravel. When the hot-mic video came out, the “not serious” candidates, particularly Kucinich and Gravel, were understandably angry: there was talk among their supporters of an establishment conspiracy. Obama, though, with numbers that would put him at the top of the G.O.P. field now, wasn’t going to be brushed away.","3111","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"What would it mean if something like the Clinton and Edwards plan was enacted today, and the front-runners in the G.O.P. race got together and swept away the single-digit guys? Currently, only Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Marco Rubio would be in the race, with Ted Cruz almost in the running. Jeb Bush would be long gone. (Even through 2012’s odd moments, like the brief Herman Cain spike, Mitt Romney’s numbers never fell so implausibly low.) The establishment bid for seriousness seems to be to keep the field broad enough to encompass its credentialed but low-performing candidates. When several of the candidates’ guys talked this weekend about the structure of the debates, the idea was not to get a smaller group but to perpetuate a large one. (Ryan Lizza has more on those discussions, from which Trump, notably, withdrew, and which may be breaking down.) What is a “gotcha” question, after all, but an attempt to identify disqualifiers, and get the numbers down? Megyn Kelly, of Fox News, correctly characterized the candidates’ various requests for improving debates, which include giving them approval over onscreen graphics and room temperature, by asking if they also wanted “foot massages.” What they really seem to want is for someone to keep massaging the poll numbers. The idea seems to be for everyone to keep hanging on until, miraculously, the Trump-Carson dynamic fundamentally changes. But how?","3112","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"To say that Trump and Carson are not serious candidates is to say that the Republican electorate is not serious. And that judgment, despite the hollowness of the candidates’ ideas, is unfair in one important way. As George Packer writes in this week’s magazine, the Republican Party has failed to respond to the real concerns, fear, and even desperation on the part of many of its traditional voters. Trump’s support is the product not of frivolity but of pain. How profound that pain might be can be seen in another set of numbers, distinct from the political race, about the rising and unexpected mortality among white, middle-aged men without a college degree. They are dying more not because of obesity or heart disease but because of suicide and substance abuse—the physical manifestations of, among other things, disquiet and displacement. The numbers in the study, carried out by Princeton University economists, caught public-health professionals by surprise. If nothing else, the study shows that there are deep pools of unhappiness in this country that the experts don’t understand. Someone has to speak to that.","3113","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"

The limitations of their notion had become clear by the time it was effectively a three-person race, and they lost. (In the 2008 Iowa caucuses, Obama won thirty-eight per cent, Edwards thirty per cent, and Clinton twenty-nine.) Indeed, watching the open-mic video now, the most pertinent point is that neither Edwards nor Clinton was, ultimately, the Democratic Party’s nominee. Then and now, it can be hard to tell who is serious.","3114","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"

"The occasion was the biggest fight so far in the phenomenal career of Gennady Gennadyevich Golovkin, known as G.G.G. (or, as it’s pronounced, Triple G), an unbeaten and seemingly unbeatable boxer from Kazakhstan. He fights as a middleweight, a hundred and sixty pounds, demolishing opponents and then grinning about it, looking less like a sadist and more like a good-natured guy delighted to discover, anew, that he can entertain crowds simply by doing something that comes naturally to him. Saturday’s crowd included plenty of Kazakhs, some of whom were enshawled in their country’s elegant flag, which imposes a golden eagle and sun on top of a sky-blue background. Some other attendees had their faces painted with darker blue bars, representing the Nicaraguan flag, because Román González, a similarly great Nicaraguan boxer, was also on the bill. González is a miniature leviathan terrorizing the flyweight division, where the limit is a hundred and twelve pounds. But many of the fans seemed to be rooting not for a country but for a sport: they were boxing connoisseurs, drawn by the opportunity to see a couple of masters at work.","3116","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/is-gennady-gennadyevich-golovkin-the-next-best-boxer-in-the-world"
"Last month, Floyd Mayweather, Jr., announced his retirement; he was widely considered the best boxer in the world, and now fans are trying to identify his replacement. If dominance is the criterion, then the most deserving fighter might be Wladimir Klitschko, the bruising Ukrainian heavyweight, who hasn’t lost in more than a decade. But the current crop of heavyweights is considered weak, and many of Klitschko’s victims have been undistinguished; those who value achievement might instead favor González, the Nicaraguan, who prevails in a more talented division. (ESPN.com officially deems González the best fighter in the world, although its senior boxing writer, Dan Rafael, thinks that title should go to Klitschko.) Another approach is the so-called eyeball test, a highly scientific approach in which the bragging rights go to whatever fighter looks the most impressive. Using this approach, Golovkin may be worthy: he looks as if he could beat anybody, even though he hasn’t yet beaten anybody very special.","3117","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/is-gennady-gennadyevich-golovkin-the-next-best-boxer-in-the-world"
"On Saturday night, González may have had the tougher challenge: he was fighting a sturdy and accomplished opponent named Brian Viloria. As it happens, they possess two of the sport’s best nicknames. González is known as Chocolatito, because he is dark-skinned, like his father, who also boxed, and who was known as Chocolate. Viloria, who was born in Hawaii, calls himself the Hawaiian Punch. Although Viloria never stopped punching and sometimes connecting, González battered him until his face started to swell; the referee’s stoppage, in the ninth round, seemed not at all too early, although Viloria said, as boxers are supposed to, that he would have liked to keep fighting.","3118","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/is-gennady-gennadyevich-golovkin-the-next-best-boxer-in-the-world"
"Golovkin’s opponent was a skilled but not extraordinary Canadian named David Lemieux, and the night seemed designed less to test Golovkin’s boxing ability than to test his commercial appeal. He has been deemed more marketable than González: bigger, and therefore scarier, but also smilier, and therefore more lovable. The fight was broadcast on pay-per-view at a price of as much as sixty dollars; this was Golovkin’s first time as the main attraction in a pay-per-view fight. In the next few weeks, as we begin to get reports of how many people bought the fight, we will have a way to measure the size of his cult, and the distance between him and an established pay-per-view star like Manny Pacquiao. At the Garden, the fight was a sellout, but a relatively soft one: as of Friday, tickets were available on the secondary market for as little as ten dollars, plus fees; for a solitary boxing fan in the city, it would have been cheaper to sit in the bleachers than to watch from home.","3119","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/is-gennady-gennadyevich-golovkin-the-next-best-boxer-in-the-world"
"Sometimes the main advantage of seeing a fight in person is aural, not visual. On Saturday, the memorable noises included not only the expected roar when Golovkin emerged, grinning, in his embroidered robe, but also the boisterous booing that arose when it was announced that one of the celebrities in attendance was Donald Trump, who paid a friendly pre-fight visit to Golovkin in his locker room. At times, it was easy to imagine Golovkin as an unlikely crossover success, following in the footsteps of Pacquiao, who has become not only a Filipino hero but also an American celebrity. (Golovkin recently moved to Los Angeles, and he has courted the region’s many Latino fans; on Saturday, two men in the crowd were wearing matching “Mexicans for Golovkin” T-shirts, which were sadly absent from the merchandise stalls.) And, at times, the event seemed like yet more proof of boxing’s niche status: while much of the city was following the Mets’ first game against the Cubs, thousands of cultists had chosen instead to spend their Saturday nights pledging allegiance to a boxer who is a household name only in a country that is surely not, itself, in many American homes, a household name.","3120","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/is-gennady-gennadyevich-golovkin-the-next-best-boxer-in-the-world"
"Golovkin didn’t provide his fans the kind of sublime or grotesque finish that they will be able to brag about having seen in person for years to come. (Attendees in search of brutality got some, earlier in the night, when a rising heavyweight named Luis Ortiz sent his overmatched opponent, Matias Ariel Vidondo, flopping face-first into the mat; as the ring filled up with functionaries, Vidondo arose, pressing his eyes shut and shouting, “I’m all right! I’m all right!”) On this night, Golovkin was surgical from the start, jouncing Lemieux’s head backward with an accurate left jab that probably would have looked dramatic even if not for Lemieux’s hair, shaved on the sides and long on the top, which whipped around every time that Golovkin made contact.","3121","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/is-gennady-gennadyevich-golovkin-the-next-best-boxer-in-the-world"
"Everyone knew that Golovkin was a better boxer, but some observers thought that Lemieux, a hard puncher, had a slim but real chance to catch Golovkin and stun him. (One oddsmaker installed Golovkin as a sixteen-to-one favorite, with Lemieux as an eight-to-one underdog.) The other, more prescient theory of the fight was that Lemieux was chosen not because he would be competitive but because he would be brave—unwilling to run, and willing to withstand Golovkin’s punches long enough to give fans their money’s worth. In the fifth round, Golovkin coiled a left hook into Lemieux’s ribs, sending Lemieux to his knees, as if in reverence. In the eighth round, after yet another barrage, Lemieux grimaced, staggered backward, and tilted forward, which gave the referee the excuse he needed to restrain Golovkin, making him the winner by technical knockout. Golovkin’s victories tend to be decisive: it has been seven years, or twenty-one fights, since last he allowed the ringside judges to complete their scorecards.","3122","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/is-gennady-gennadyevich-golovkin-the-next-best-boxer-in-the-world"
"Plenty of boxing fans are pleased to be finished (for now) with the Mayweather era, in which the sport’s biggest star was a singularly frustrating performer, easily winning fight after fight by staying just out of his opponents’ reach. Golovkin, despite being the connoisseurs’ darling, puts on the kind of performances that require no expertise to admire. He is supremely technically skilled, but he is also an excellent puncher, and punisher, which means that opponents who don’t quit or collapse nevertheless tend to wind up looking, as Lemieux eventually did, like victims of a much cruder kind of assault, possibly one having nothing to do with athletics. Golovkin’s fights look a bit like what the average non-specialist, reared on artificially percussive boxing movies, is likely to picture when picturing a boxing match.","3123","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/is-gennady-gennadyevich-golovkin-the-next-best-boxer-in-the-world"
"Golovkin is thirty-three, which means that he may only have a few years left in his prime. Next month, Saúl (Canelo) Álvarez will face Miguel Cotto, in a fight likely to draw a far bigger audience than this one did; if Golovkin gets a chance to fight the winner, his fan base may outgrow its cult status. Mayweather was a complicated sort of boxing star, but Golovkin would not be. He is much less familiar to casual sports fans, at least for now, but he is also much more likely to give them what they want, if he ever gets the chance.","3124","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/is-gennady-gennadyevich-golovkin-the-next-best-boxer-in-the-world"
"The atmosphere during the first week of the new Metropolitan Opera season was less dire than it was this time last year, when a twenty-two-million-dollar deficit loomed, management and labor had all but come to blows over a threatened lockout, and busloads of vitriolic protesters tried to shut down John Adams’s “The Death of Klinghoffer.” This fall, politicians have spared us thoughts about operas they have not seen; mutinous mutterings, whether from unions or donors, have subsided; and Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, is enjoying a flurry of good press, following the announcement that the deficit has given way to a million-dollar surplus. To be sure, this correction resulted from cuts in expenses, not from gains in attendance. No one believes that the crisis is over; an air of desperation lingers. There is even talk of allowing a donor to rename the Met. With the names David Geffen and David H. Koch emblazoned elsewhere on Lincoln Center Plaza, a terrifying opening exists for Donald Trump.","3125","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/golden-oldies-musical-events-alex-ross"
"The Met’s financial progress has coincided with artistic retrenchment. The current season is one of the most conservative in recent memory—essentially, an eight-month festival of nineteenth-century Italian opera. Of twenty-five works in repertory, only two, “Turandot” and “Lulu,” were written in the past hundred years. Furthermore, the revolution in production style that Gelb promised when he took over, nearly a decade ago, hasn’t happened. There have been a few scandal-making shows, but nothing markedly bolder than Robert Wilson’s 1998 “Lohengrin” and other scattered experiments of the Joseph Volpe era. This season’s first new staging—an “Otello” directed by Bartlett Sher, with sets by Es Devlin—is yet another spare, cool, vaguely modernistic affair, with sliding translucent walls and flickering projections juxtaposed with an array of period costumes. The preceding “Otello,” by Elijah Moshinsky, which was first seen in 1994, was no masterpiece, but it had more dramatic verve.","3126","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/golden-oldies-musical-events-alex-ross"
"The Met isn’t the only American house playing it safe. David Gockley, the outgoing head of the San Francisco Opera, has argued that opera is a “bourgeois art form,” and that new work should be commissioned only if it speaks a language that “audiences can immediately embrace.” The obvious riposte, other than to question the continued existence of a bourgeoisie, is to point out that some of the most beloved operas in the repertory—“Tristan und Isolde,” “Carmen,” “Madama Butterfly”—weren’t exactly opening-night hits. It’s odd to hear this from Gockley, who, when he led the Houston Grand Opera, introduced Adams’s “Nixon in China,” a modern classic that many people found oppressive at first hearing. Gelb, to his credit, is less cautious: works by Kaija Saariaho and Thomas Adès, hardly Puccini sound-alikes, are scheduled for coming years. For the most part, though, this season’s Met is a time warp. If the brochure had gone out to passengers booked for the Titanic, they would have been puzzled more by the paper stock than by the repertory.","3127","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/golden-oldies-musical-events-alex-ross"
"If the Met can’t seem to escape the John Jacob Astor era, it should at least offer voices of beauty and power. The Italian onslaught that opened the season—“Otello,” “Il Trovatore,” “Anna Bolena,” and “Turandot”—satisfied that criterion, at least when it comes to female roles. For whatever reason, the kinds of soprano and mezzo voices suited for the Rossini-to-Puccini canon, whether of the nimble bel-canto or forceful spinto type, are thriving, and the Met engaged several leading practitioners in a concentrated period. Sonya Yoncheva and Jamie Barton sang in “Otello” and “Anna Bolena,” respectively. Sondra Radvanovsky, in the title role of “Anna Bolena,” began a season-long traversal of Donizetti’s trio of Tudor queens. Christine Goerke, the Met’s new star dramatic soprano, essayed her first staged Turandot. And Anna Netrebko, having ventured Lady Macbeth last season, moved on to Leonora in “Trovatore.” (I saw “Anna Bolena” at its first performance, the others on their second nights.)","3128","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/golden-oldies-musical-events-alex-ross"
"The news in advance of “Otello” was that the Met had made the welcome decision to abandon blackface makeup for the title role. Aleksandrs Antonenko sang that arduous part accurately and with contained fire, but the director didn’t find another way to indicate why Otello might be a volatile outsider. Antonenko and Željko Lučić, the Iago, often seemed interchangeably grim. Yoncheva, a thirty-three-year-old Bulgarian, made a much deeper impression. I first heard her in 2010, when she appeared in Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas,” under William Christie, at bam. She struck me then as an intelligent, sensitive singer who held back from the primal sorrow of Dido’s Lament. Either she has grown spectacularly or, more likely, I missed something. In just a few years, she has emerged as a major lyric soprano, and as Desdemona she succeeded in putting a decisive stamp on a character who is too often portrayed as a fleshless signifier of doomed innocence. This Desdemona is confident and passionate, so certain of her rectitude and so disbelieving of her husband’s rage that she inadvertently provokes him. More or less on her own, Yoncheva generated the tragic tension on which the piece turns, although she had crucial support from Yannick Nézet-Séguin and the Met orchestra. Nézet-Séguin, who is considered James Levine’s heir apparent, has sometimes favored exactitude over excitement, but the formidable last hour of “Otello” suggested that he might be ready for the job.","3129","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/golden-oldies-musical-events-alex-ross"
"Yoncheva is a charismatic actor, her face a transparent screen of emotion. Mainly, though, she creates character with the voice. Great Verdi singing is an art of transition, arising not from the immaculate execution of this or that aria but from an accretion of telling contrasts. Yoncheva’s rendition of Desdemona’s solo scene—the almost twenty-minute sequence, including the Willow Song and the Ave Maria, in which the character prepares to die—was a tour de force of nuance. At the outset, as Desdemona tells Emilia that Otello seems calmer, the voice had an eerie matter-of-factness. With the line “If I should die before you,” there was an abrupt influx of feeling, in the Callas manner. Then, when Desdemona recalls her mother’s maidservant, who sang of the willow, Yoncheva applied an original touch: an unadorned, vibrato-light sound, almost in Baroque style, suggesting movement back in time. Christie’s influence was apparent in the minute vocal inflections: the word salce, or “willow,” occurs more than a dozen times, and Yoncheva kept coloring it a little differently, as if it were a memento she was turning over in her hands. Other phrases were delivered with a dry, almost folkish flavor, or with melting legato, or with scooping sensuousness, or with chilly precision. The beginning of the Ave Maria evoked a tremulous adolescent. The most wrenching transition came in Desdemona’s farewell to Emilia: first, a hollow, stifled “Buona notte”; then the immense descending phrase on “Ah! Emilia, Emilia, addio!,” the initial A-sharp detonating in the air. Yoncheva lacks a huge tone, but sheer volume is not the only way to make four thousand people hang on every note.","3130","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/golden-oldies-musical-events-alex-ross"
"As for Goerke, Radvanovsky, and Barton, all are commanding artists who in the Met’s opening week could be found singing roles for which they are not perfectly suited. Turandot is a thankless part that requires the soprano first to issue icy high notes over some of Puccini’s most inventive music and then to enact a profound transformation over the inferior bombast concocted after Puccini’s death by Franco Alfano. Goerke is at her best riding the turbulent psychological currents of Wagner and Strauss: Turandot’s fairy-tale strangeness eluded her, although she came alive as the character became more human. Zeffirelli’s 1987 production, a theme park of chinoiserie, raises the question of whether the Met, having set aside blackface, should reconsider inane Asian stereotypes.","3131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/golden-oldies-musical-events-alex-ross"
"“Anna Bolena,” Donizetti’s 1830 masterpiece, is a bel-canto score that looks ahead to Verdi. In a house as big as the Met, it is often cast with heavier, less idiomatic voices. So it was when Netrebko sang the title role, in 2011; plush lyric lines fared better than florid runs. Radvanovsky and Barton, too, never seemed fully at ease with the rapid-fire figuration, although both sang with stamina, intelligence, and style. Radvanovsky hit her peak late in the opera, when the doomed queen is outwardly stately and inwardly anguished; the ruddy, grainy quality of her voice assumed a painterly glow. Barton, who played Jane Seymour, is a once-in-a-generation talent who can sing Purcell and Wagner with equal authority. But agile music shortchanges her: you want to hear that luminous tone extend through the bar.","3132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/golden-oldies-musical-events-alex-ross"
"In “Trovatore,” the women and the men both held their own. Netrebko has developed a voluptuous lower register that gave weight to her central arias; Dolora Zajick, as Azucena, retains thunderous force. Yonghoon Lee cut a romantic profile as Manrico and offered ardent, purposeful phrases. But the evening belonged to Dmitri Hvorostovsky, who, in June, revealed that he had a brain tumor and would undergo treatment this fall. He nonetheless elected to sing three performances as the Count di Luna. An unfailingly elegant lord of legato, Hvorostovsky here showed more bite and edge than usual, giving pained strength to his high G at the end of “Il balen.” The troubled nobility of the character blended with the courage of the singer. Verdi’s familiar old opera, receiving its six-hundred-and-thirty-ninth performance at the Met, became a matter of life and death. ♦","3133","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/golden-oldies-musical-events-alex-ross"
"One recent morning at the Jefferson Hotel, in Washington, D.C., Peter Wehner, a conservative writer who served as an adviser for the past three Republican Presidents, described his party’s problems over a bowl of oatmeal. He said, “We got clobbered in 2012”—the fifth Presidential election out of the past six in which the Republican candidate lost the popular vote. “There’s a demographic problem. White votes are going down two points every year. We’re out of touch with the middle class.” Mitt Romney—whose very hair embodies wealthy privilege—was nominated at a national convention, in Tampa, that became an Ayn Rand-style celebration of business executives, the heroic “makers.” During the campaign, Romney wrote off forty-seven per cent of the country—the “takers”—as government parasites. He went on to lose badly to President Barack Obama, whom Republicans had regarded as an obvious failure, a target as vulnerable as Jimmy Carter. In the shock of that defeat, Wehner said, some conservatives realized that “there was a need for a policy agenda that reaches the middle class.” He added, “This was not a blinding insight.”","3134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"A generation ago, Democrats lost five of six Presidential elections; in 1992, Bill Clinton, calling himself a New Democrat, ended the streak. Clinton didn’t repudiate the whole Democratic platform—government activism on behalf of ordinary Americans remained the Party’s core idea—but he adopted positions on issues like crime and welfare that were more closely aligned with the views of the majority, including some rank-and-file Democrats. The message, Wehner said, was as much symbolic as substantive: “ ‘We’re not a radical party; we’ve sanded off our rougher edges, and you can trust me.’ ” He went on, “The hope for some of us was that our candidate in 2016 would be the Republican version of Clinton”—a conservative reformer who, having learned from past defeats, championed economic policies that placed Republicans on the side of the hard-pressed, including non-white Americans, the soon-to-be majority.","3135","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"For fresh ideas, such a candidate had only to turn to a group of Republican thinkers who call themselves “reformocons,” of whom Wehner is a leader. Last year, the reformocons published a pamphlet of policy proposals called “Room to Grow,” on health care, education, taxes, entitlements, and other topics. In an introduction, Wehner writes, “Americans do not have a sense that conservatives offer them a better shot at success and security than liberals. For that to change, conservatives in American politics need to understand constituents’ concerns, speak to those aspirations and worries, and help people see how applying conservative principles and deploying conservative policies could help make their lives better.”","3136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The essays don’t upend Republican orthodoxy. They argue that government should intervene on behalf of poor and middle-income Americans, but in ways that apply market principles to public policy, taking power away from Washington and giving individuals more options. Some proposals are familiar: school choice, health-care savings accounts. Others are more daring—for example, having college education underwritten by private investors, then repaid over the next decade as a predetermined percentage of graduates’ earnings. A few ideas, such as a wage subsidy that would increase the pay of workers making less than forty thousand dollars a year, building on the Earned Income Tax Credit, could easily garner bipartisan support.","3137","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Room to Grow” contains a striking description of the American economic landscape: children born into poverty with little chance of escaping it, and middle-class families overwhelmed by the rising costs of health care and education while their incomes stay flat. It’s not that different from the story that Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Massachusetts senator, tells. After years of ignoring these stark realities—or of blaming big government, in the spirit of Ronald Reagan—some Republicans have begun to sound more like Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt.","3138","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The reformocon project shows how extreme mainstream conservatism has become in its opposition to anything involving the state. The reformocons court right-wing censure simply by acknowledging that the middle class is under pressure, and that government has a role to play beyond cutting taxes. The reckless, and ultimately doomed, shutdown of the federal government by congressional Republicans, in October, 2013, precipitated the first conference of reformocons, in Middleburg, Virginia, and that led to “Room to Grow.”","3139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"When the 2016 Presidential campaign began, an organizer of the conference, April Ponnuru, became a policy adviser to Jeb Bush. Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, read an essay by Wehner and Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in the Bush White House, titled “A Conservative Vision of Government,” and expressed approval to an aide. Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, sought policy advice from several reformocons, including Yuval Levin, who, as editor of the quarterly National Affairs, is the group’s foremost intellectual. Earlier this year, Rubio published a book, “American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,” interwoven with the personal stories of struggling Floridians. Most of the policy ideas came directly from “Room to Grow,” a debt that Rubio acknowledged effusively.","3140","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"Donald Trump’s campaign first attracted attention, in the press and among Republican voters, when he disparaged Mexican immigrants. Since he entered the race, in June, slurs and feuds have been the mainstay of his media image. Less widely discussed are his positions on working- and middle-class concerns like trade, taxes, and entitlements. In his scattershot, get-out-of-my-way fashion, Trump has vowed to rewrite trade deals involving China, impose tariffs on the products of American companies that send manufacturing overseas, leave Social Security and Medicare alone, and raise taxes on hedge-fund managers. (“I want to save the middle class. The hedge-fund guys didn’t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.”) To the reformocons’ dismay, Trump has commandeered their target audience and tainted their high-minded proposals.","3142","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Trump’s popularity isn’t based on ideology. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he draws about evenly from Republicans who consider themselves “moderate to liberal,” “somewhat conservative,” and “very conservative.” More than anything, Trump supporters are defined by class: non-college-educated whites favor him at twice the rate of those with college degrees. Trump is attracting the very blue-collar Americans whom the reformocons were aiming to bind to the Republican Party. So far, at least, these voters, many of them angry and alienated, aren’t listening to the “Room to Grow” crowd. They’re thrilling to madder music.","3143","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Working-class whites remain the most coveted demographic in American politics, even as they shrink as a percentage of the electorate. Ever since Ronald Reagan became President, Democrats have worried about their declining share of this vote. In 2012, Obama captured just thirty-six per cent of white voters without college degrees, down three per cent from 2008—partly owing to the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act, and skewed by Obama’s abysmal numbers among white Southerners. The emergence of the reformocons shows that more thoughtful Republicans have also grown concerned about the allegiance of the Party’s presumed base.","3144","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Last year, a Gallup poll found that forty-five per cent of Republicans think that the rich should pay more in taxes. Another poll, by the Pew Research Center, showed that more Republicans favor increased spending on Social Security, Medicare, education, and infrastructure than favor cutting those programs. Although government activism is anathema to conservative donors and Grover Norquist, it’s fine with a lot of Republicans making less than fifty thousand dollars a year. April Ponnuru’s husband, Ramesh, a contributor to “Room to Grow” and a senior editor at National Review, said, “Trump shows that Republican voters are not especially dogmatic conservatives—not as much as I’d like them to be.”","3145","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Reihan Salam, the executive editor of National Review, told me, “Trump is not someone I consider an ideal candidate—he does not represent my line of thinking. But he is proving that certain beliefs the professional political class had about who Republican primary voters are—what they respond to, what they care about—were just incorrect.” In 2008, Salam, along with Ross Douthat, the Times columnist, published a manifesto that presaged the reformocon movement: “Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.” Salam grew up in lower-middle-class, multi-ethnic Brooklyn. At Harvard, where he met Douthat, he became interested in wage subsidies “as a way to enhance the legitimacy of market economies,” he said. “There’s a natural marriage between a belief in a dynamic economy and a belief in solidarity and mutual trust, because the one tempers the other. Most human beings seek stability. A society where you allow this idea of a dynamic economy to pervade every aspect of life is very frightening to people, and certainly you’re not going to be able to build a political coalition around it.”","3146","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Salam, the son of Bangladeshi immigrants, is critical of increased immigration and believes that Trump, though the wrong messenger, has forced an important issue into the open. He points to evidence that second-generation Hispanic Americans have less faith in the country’s promise than their parents did—that the vaunted American talent for absorbing people from other places is waning under economic pressure. Salam’s idea of a national community, united by a sense of mutual obligations and a belief in legitimate institutions, evokes the type of conservatism found in Europe. Trump, meanwhile, calls to mind Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi: a strongman, a nationalist, and a nativist, who appeals to voters of limited means by tapping into their gauzy aspirations, echoing their anxieties about decline, and assuring them a secure place in a country restored to greatness. Trump presents himself as a capitalist boss who won’t let capitalism tear apart the (white) social fabric.","3147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

His sustained popularity shows how contradictory and irrational the Party has become. It’s as if, in 1992, Democrats had thrown their support to Ross Perot, not Bill Clinton, because Perot—while departing from much of the Party’s basic ideology and offering only crude policy simplifications—voiced the submerged feelings of many Democrats whose presence hadn’t registered with national leaders and pundits.","3149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The Wall Street Journal has denounced him for supporting protectionist trade policies and higher taxes on the wealthy, especially hedge-fund managers and other beneficiaries of the “carried-interest” loophole, which allows them to pay taxes at lower rates than middle-income Americans. The Club for Growth, a conservative pressure group devoted to low taxes and small government, has aired ads deploring Trump’s past positions on taxes.

"“This is like a lunar eclipse,” Wehner told me in August, when many Republicans still believed that Trump would fade by September. “The damage he’s doing—while he’s leading in the polls, that’s the face and voice of the Party, and it’s toxic.” Wehner insisted that Trump is the antithesis of real conservatism: his confidence in his ability to fix America’s problems single-handedly shows no understanding of the restraints embedded in the Constitution and the separation of powers. “In no traditional sense could you call him a conservative,” Wehner said. “Conservatism in the spirit of Madison is the idea of taking popular passions and channelling them in a constructive way. Trump is doing the opposite—he’s taking popular passions and stoking them, by demonizing the Other.” Since then, Trump’s front-runner status has been challenged by another outsider, Ben Carson, who presents even more extreme ideas, but with a whisper instead of a shout. In late September, Wehner posted an essay on the Commentary Web site called “The G.O.P. Is Killing Itself.”","3152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Conservatism in the spirit of Madison” has almost ceased to exist. The outlook of the Republican grass roots, and of many Party leaders, is what Richard Hofstadter, writing toward the end of the McCarthy era, called “pseudo-conservative,” because “its exponents, although they believe themselves to be conservatives and usually employ the rhetoric of conservatism, show signs of a serious and restless dissatisfaction with American life, traditions, and institutions.” Republicans today have given the country conservatism in the spirit of Sarah Palin, whose ignorance about the world, contempt for expertise, and raw appeals to white identity politics presaged Trump’s incendiary campaign. So did the spectacle, in 2009, of a Republican congressman calling the President a liar during a speech Obama gave to a joint session of Congress, and Party leaders comparing Obamacare to Nazism and slavery. Earlier this year, forty-seven Republican senators wrote the Supreme Leader of Iran and declared that the President didn’t speak for the country. There have been regular threats to close the federal government in order to accomplish limited political goals. (In September, another shutdown, over the defunding of Planned Parenthood, was narrowly avoided, despite the support of nearly all the Republican Presidential candidates.) On right-wing radio, Obama is constantly accused of tyranny and treason. Once the restraints are lifted, they’re hard to restore.

"In mid-September, I travelled to a small town in southeastern New Hampshire called Raymond, where John Kasich was holding a town-hall meeting in a middle-school auditorium. Eighty chairs were arranged around a stool. One of the early arrivals was a twenty-six-year-old named Mark Lynch, who had come with his grandmother. Lynch, the son of a firefighter and a factory worker, had a crewcut and stubble, and wore a Red Sox T-shirt that exposed the tattoos on his biceps. He had just finished four years of service in the Navy and was training to be a policeman. Lynch wanted to hear what Kasich had to say, but he was more interested in the billionaire with the copper comb-over.","3154","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Trump is tapping into this belief that politicians are self-serving,” Lynch told me. “He’s telling these donors, ‘I don’t need your money, I’ll finance my own campaign.’ If you look at what’s controlling government these days, it’s lobbyists and all these big corporations.” Lynch liked Trump’s positions on trade, taxes, and Wall Street. “People don’t want to see billionaires getting richer,” he said. “If Donald Trump, a billionaire in his own right, is saying billionaires in Washington and New York should be paying more—that says something.”","3155","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Lynch sounded a bit like a Sanders guy. When I pointed this out, his grandmother made a face. Lynch said that he couldn’t possibly vote for Sanders—“a self-proclaimed socialist from Vermont.” Lynch was a conservative, not so much on specific policies but in his values and in his ideas about America’s character. He didn’t want an overweening government creating costly programs and interfering in people’s lives. He just wanted a system that wasn’t rigged in favor of the rich and well-connected.","3156","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In Lynch’s eyes, his antipathy toward this privileged class didn’t make him an unwitting Democrat. “I don’t think Republicans are the party of big corporations and billionaires,” he said. “They’re for ordinary middle-class people.” The problem wasn’t conservatism but the dirty role of money in politics.

"Kasich entered the room, dressed casually, all in black. At sixty-three, he’s lean and combative, with a slump in his posture and a jutting neck. He served nine terms in Congress, and, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, in the nineties, he was a key lieutenant of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and a crusader for balanced budgets. As he never fails to tell audiences, he helped craft the 1997 deal that brought surpluses to the federal government for the first time in three decades, though most of the credit belonged to a booming economy. Elected governor of Ohio in 2010, and reëlected overwhelmingly last year, Kasich turned the state’s deficits into surpluses, while cutting taxes.

"“I’m running for President ’cause I know how to land the plane,” he said, without mentioning the name of the candidate who could well crash it. “I understand that people are frustrated. My dad carried mail on his back. My mother was a blue-collar housewife. I understand anxieties about losing jobs and ringing up college debt. I know all this. But we can beat these things.” The way to beat them was to cut the deficit and say no to special interests in Washington. He offered no policy proposals to help the middle class, besides balancing the federal budget and deregulating business.","3159","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich added a dose of spiritual uplift to this starchy message. “We need to live a life bigger than ourselves,” he said. “Life is not just about me, me, me, me, me. Do you agree with that? It’s about living a life that’s bigger than yourself. . . . I am the most flawed in this room, but at least I know I give grace and every day I can start over and try to do something positive.” There’s a strain of George W. Bush’s compassionate conservatism in Kasich. (During a run for the Presidency in 2000, Kasich admitted to wishing that he’d thought up the term.) He often mentions the working poor in the same breath as the addicted and the mentally ill, as if all three groups needed charitable help. He has supported the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio, to the abhorrence of many conservatives; he likes to say that he’ll have this accomplishment in hand when St. Peter asks him what he did for the poor. “Be a center of justice and healing,” Kasich told the audience in Raymond.","3160","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The best alternative, he felt, was Rubio. When I pointed out that Rubio was a Washington insider, Lynch sighed. “That’s the pickle I’m in, and a lot of people are in,” he said. “No matter who gets elected, it’s just going to be more of the same.

But “inequality” is a word that Republicans don’t like to use. Romney, during his Presidential campaign, characterized “inequality” as a code word: “I think it’s about envy. I think it’s about class warfare.”","3169","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"In other words, the way to think about inequality is by looking down, not up. It’s not the wealth amassed at the top but, rather, the lack of “skills, values, and habits” at the bottom that accounts for the widening income gap. Oddly, Wehner’s essay barely mentions the economic struggles of the middle class. A close look at the three middle quintiles of income, where Americans with an education, a job, and a spouse can be found treading water or sinking, would have forced him to reconsider the notion that a lack of “social capital”—as opposed to just capital—explains the entire problem.","3171","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though the reformocons recognize the difficulties of the middle class, they prefer to focus not on income disparities but on “mobility,” which describes how individuals fare across their own life span and in comparison with past generations. Levin told me that the word “growth”—the unconvincing mantra of supply-siders—was losing its hold on conservatives. When Jeb Bush predicted that his economic policies would lead to four-per-cent economic growth, a level not seen since the late nineties, the claim was either ignored or derided. “ ‘Mobility’ is much healthier,” Levin said. “It’s the right lens to talk about the economy.”","3172","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"But there’s a reason to look up as well as down the economic ladder, and it has nothing to do with envy or with punishing the rich. Economic stratification, and the rise of a super-wealthy class, threatens our democracy. Americans are growing increasingly separated from one another along lines of class, in every aspect of life: where they’re born and grow up, where they go to school, what they eat, how they travel, whom they marry, what their children do, how long they live, how they die. What kind of “national community” built on “mutual obligation” is possible when Americans have so little shared experience? The Princeton economist Alan Krueger has demonstrated that societies with higher levels of income inequality are societies with lower levels of social mobility. As America has grown less economically equal, a citizen’s ability to move upward has fallen behind that of citizens in other Western democracies. We are no longer the country where anyone can become anything.","3173","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality saps the economy by draining the buying power of Americans whose incomes have stagnated, forcing them to rely on debt to fund education, housing, and health care. At the top, it creates deep pools of wealth that have nowhere productive to go, leading to asset bubbles in capital markets bearing little or no relation to the health of the over-all economy. (Critics call this the “financialization” of the economy.) These fallouts from inequality were among the causes of the Great Recession.","3174","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality is also warping America’s political system. Greatly concentrated wealth leads to outsized political power in the hands of the few—even in a democracy with free and fair elections—which pushes government to create rules that favor the rich. It’s no accident that we’re in the era of Citizens United. Such rulings give ordinary Americans the strong suspicion that the game is rigged. Democratic institutions no longer feel legitimate when they continue to produce blatantly unfair outcomes; it’s one of those insights that only an élite could miss. And it’s backed up by evidence as well as by common sense. Last year, two political scientists found that, in recent times, policy ideas have rarely been adopted by the U.S. government unless they’re favored by corporations and the wealthy—even when those ideas are supported by most Americans. The persistence of the highly unpopular carried-interest loophole for hedge-fund managers is simply the most unseemly example.","3175","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"Thus far in the campaign, the ideas of the reformocons have scarcely made an appearance among the Republican candidates. In Washington in June, Rubio—the favorite of the reformers—gave a speech to a group of them summarizing the arguments of his book. And he became the first Republican candidate to support paid family leave when, in September, he proposed a tax credit for businesses that offer their employees between four and twelve weeks off to care for newborns or sick family members. (Critics say that the tax credit wouldn’t offset enough of the costs in wages to induce companies to permit such leaves.) For the most part, though, Rubio has left the proposals in “American Dreams” on the shelf. “Rubio has the most interesting platform, but he’s not using it,” Ramesh Ponnuru said. Rubio, the son of a bartender and a maid who both emigrated from Cuba, “has established himself as the articulate, different Republican in a biographical sense,” Ponnuru added. “He’s not working to establish himself as a problem-solver. His campaign guys must be saying, ‘You have a good story, and voters aren’t interested in policy ideas.’ ”","3177","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In April, Rubio announced a tax proposal that hardly diverges from the Republican Party line. It offers families a twenty-five-hundred-dollar tax credit per child. But the proposal also reduces income taxes beyond the levels of George W. Bush’s cuts, making them even more regressive; cuts corporate taxes by ten per cent; and eliminates taxes on most investment income and inheritance. It gives a huge windfall to the rich, amounting to trillions of dollars in tax revenue. At the same time, Rubio promises to increase defense spending and pass a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Ponnuru offered an explanation for Rubio’s lapse into conventional conservative thinking: “The problem with the campaign-finance system is that it forces the candidates to spend too much time with rich people.”","3178","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

Hunt: “The more you increase things like the child tax credit, the more you will move back to the 1960s and 70s tax system with higher tax rates.”","3179","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Jeb Bush, another hope of the reformocons, issued his tax plan in September. He framed it as an attempt to support social mobility and the “right to rise”—the name of his Super PAC, which, in the first half of the year, raised more than a hundred million dollars. Such rhetoric fooled some political reporters into characterizing the plan as “populist.” Though it does eliminate the carried-interest loophole, it offers the rich more than ample compensation, in the form of a large cut in income and capital-gains taxes. According to the Times, people making ten million dollars or more a year would see their effective tax rates reduced from twenty-six to twenty-one per cent, saving them an average of a million and a half dollars a year. Bush’s plan would drain up to $3.4 trillion dollars from the Treasury.","3180","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In the end, the reformocon candidates haven’t sounded that much different from Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, and Rand Paul. All of them have had more to say about defunding Planned Parenthood, shutting down the federal government, repealing Obamacare, balancing the budget, and building a wall along the border with Mexico than about the problems of the middle class. The mantle of economic populism has essentially been handed to Donald Trump.","3181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"At a press conference at Trump Tower on September 28th, Trump unveiled his own tax plan. “Too few Americans are working, too many jobs are being shipped overseas, and too many middle-income families cannot make ends meet,” he proclaimed. “This plan directly meets these challenges, and the challenges also of business.” What followed was a tax cut for just about everybody. Seventy-five million Americans—single people making less than twenty-five thousand dollars a year and married couples making less than fifty—would be dropped from the tax rolls altogether. But the biggest winners would be the rich: Trump would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, and would cut the rates of the top earners by fourteen per cent, below the level proposed by Bush. Even Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform blessed Trump’s plan. In the midst of an anti-establishment revolt, supply-side dogma has an unbreakable hold on Republican politics.","3182","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Trump is as popular in Ohio as anywhere else,” John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron, told me in September, in his office. The Presidential campaign felt far away—Ohio’s primary isn’t until next March—but the state remains key to the general election. “Part of it is that Trump’s an emblem of success, and the other part of it is he taps people’s anger,” Green said. “It’s not the same anger as a few years ago, when it was ‘Where are the jobs?’ Now it’s ‘Where’s our share of the American dream?’ ” Green, who does polling research on Ohio and American politics, went on, “A lot of white working-class votes are up for grabs in this election. In recent years, they’ve gone Republican, but this year the Democrats could get a slice of them.” The Republican coalition of business interests and the white working class, he said, “is under more stress this year than it’s been for a while.”","3183","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Twenty-five minutes down Interstate 77 is Canton, the city where William McKinley—the first truly modern, pro-business Republican President—lies in a black granite sarcophagus under a marble dome. Canton is one of those American towns where industrial decline and population loss give a sense of uninhabited space. The Hoover vacuum company, once headquartered in North Canton, was acquired in 2007 by a Hong Kong firm that moved production to Mexico and China. An abandoned brick factory is being redeveloped for white-collar service companies and apartments. Alongside the interstate, a former Hoover plant has become a megachurch with a congregation of thirty-five hundred souls, some of whom once assembled vacuum cleaners on the premises.","3184","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"After a winter of continuous below-zero temperatures, many of Canton’s streets crumbled, and nearly a year later they remain impassable. The Democratic mayor, William Healy, laid the blame for the city’s infrastructure woes on climate change and John Kasich. In balancing Ohio’s budget, the Governor dramatically reduced state contributions to local governments while cutting certain business taxes and eliminating the estate tax. The result, Healy said, was a loss of seventeen million dollars to Canton—twenty per cent of its revenue—bringing spending below the level of 2007. The Mayor had to choose between keeping policemen and firemen employed or repairing broken streets. “That tells you the impact of John Kasich,” he said. “But on the national front, where you’ve got Trump, Kasich comes across as a moderate! Damaging as Kasich has been to my city, as mayor, if I had to vote for a Republican for President I would vote for Kasich over the entire field. That tells you where the Republican Party has gone.”","3185","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Around Ohio, local governments are being forced to choose between raising taxes and neglecting services, even though the state now has a two-billion-dollar “rainy-day fund.” In his stump speech in New Hampshire, Kasich claimed that his fiscal policies helped create three hundred thousand jobs. In fact, Ohio remains below its pre-recession employment rate, meaning that the state has lagged behind most of the country during the recovery. Zach Schiller, the head of research at the nonpartisan group Policy Matters Ohio, in Cleveland, told me, “Kasich’s claims to good economic performance? I don’t know if I want to say ‘deceptive,’ but they’re certainly misleading.”","3186","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"According to Policy Matters Ohio, since 2013 Kasich’s policies, including a higher sales tax and cigarette tax, have raised average annual taxes on the state’s poorest fifth by seventeen dollars, given middle-income people a ninety-four-dollar cut, and returned seventeen thousand dollars to members of the one per cent. “We’ve engineered a tax shift to lower- and middle-income Ohioans,” Schiller said. “And we’ve reduced over-all tax revenue.”","3187","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich’s tax policies have earned him the approval of Arthur Laffer, a native of nearby Youngstown, whose famous curve—supposedly demonstrating that lower income taxes generate higher revenue by stimulating economic growth—started the revolution in supply-side economics, forty years ago. Schiller pointed out that nothing in Ohio’s recent economic experience supports supply-side theory. The same is true nationally: growth has accelerated in periods when tax rates have been higher on top earners and stalled when rates came down. Kasich, who has positioned himself as the capable, reasonable, experienced “grownup” on the G.O.P. stage, is a supply-sider at his core. As long as Republicans cling to the warped logic of trickle-down economics, their efforts to help middle-class Americans will be largely rhetorical.","3188","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"East of Canton, there’s a small steel mill owned by a Pittsburgh company called Allegheny Technologies, Inc. On a strip of grass outside the mill, around a dozen locked-out steelworkers were picketing under a white tent, with American flags, water bottles, and defiant signs: “Unfairly Locked Out for 32 Days”; “Greed, Power & Control Rule A.T.I.—Lockout Proves It!” The Canton area has a history of racial prejudice, but the picket line was one place where it was possible to find black and white men hanging out together.","3189","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

In June, A.T.I. offered the union representing the employees, the United Steelworkers, a new contract, asking for a hundred and forty-five concessions. The company claimed that it was under pressure from foreign and nonunion U.S. competitors. However, executive pay had risen more than fifty per cent during 2014, and the total compensation of the chief executive, Richard J. Harshman, had risen seventy per cent, to nearly eight million dollars, in spite of the company’s poor performance.

A worker named Mike Yeater said that he liked Trump’s positions on “immigration stuff and issues like that—he’s got patriotic beliefs.” But after Trump told the Detroit News that union autoworkers needed to accept lower wages Yeater stopped paying attention to him. Another worker said that he’d been reading Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-first Century,” and that he liked Sanders but was also interested in Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard professor who is running for President on a platform of radical campaign-finance reform.

"Baum calls himself an independent libertarian. “I believe in the company’s right to make money,” he said. “It helps all of us. And I also believe in the worker’s right to bargain for a fair wage.” In 2004, as president of the local, Baum led difficult negotiations; managers and workers eventually came to terms by making concessions—they needed one another to keep the steel industry alive. “This time is different,” he said. “They brought new people in to break the union. They do not respect us. They look at us as a number.”","3195","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Baum believes that “The Jungle,” Upton Sinclair’s classic novel about the Chicago stockyards, should be required reading for American corporations. “At the turn of the century, the boss would go home and sleep with your wife in order for you to keep your job,” he said. Unions, he explained, were “a necessary evil. We need them, ’cause without them—I don’t know if you’d see a return to the turn of the century, where children are working, but corporations still have that deep-rooted sense of ‘I’ll just work you.

He has voted Republican all his life, except for two times, when he voted for Ross Perot. This year, Baum was supporting Trump. He didn’t agree with everything Trump said, but he liked his position on trade and his tax plan—the way that it cut working-class people’s taxes to zero but also gave businesses a financial break, “because it’s killing our industries’ competitiveness.” He thought that Trump was strong enough to bring jobs back to America, and he appreciated his willingness to tell both parties, “You can’t buy me.” Baum found Trump’s insulting manner refreshing, calling it “a mirror of the way they treat us.”","3197","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

This is a country of capitalists—everybody should be rich. The problem is, the rich don’t want anybody rubbing shoulders with them. The middle class hits that wall and can’t get over it.

"In an essay in “Room to Grow,” Yuval Levin describes what makes conservatives different from liberals. Conservatives don’t emphasize the individual and the state; they focus on the space between—where families, communities, religious groups, associations, and private enterprises create a web of interrelationships. “What happens in that space generally happens face to face—between parents and children, neighbors and friends, buyers and sellers,” he writes. “It therefore answers to immediately felt needs, and is tailored to the characters, sentiments, priorities, and preferences of the people involved. This kind of bottom-up common life, rather than massive, distant systems of material provision, is what makes society tick.”","3199","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Levin’s description of American life sounds appealing, but it does not reflect the reality of the steelworkers’ lives. The “massive, distant system of material provision” is their company, which is far more top-down than any federal bureaucracy. Nothing happens face to face; immediately felt needs go ignored; families don’t matter. There is no “common life” except for the workers’ desperate effort to stick together as they look ahead to weeks or months without pay—or, perhaps, a future without a job. Global competition is making these workers disposable, and so they are turning for insight and inspiration to Sanders, or Piketty, or Trump. The reformocons, for all their creativity and eloquence, don’t grasp the nature of the world in which their cherished middle-class Americans actually live.

But rather than resigning himself to the situation, he went down to the White House briefing room and issued one of the most powerful statements that he has delivered since taking office.

And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America—next week, or a couple of months from now….

"Earlier this year, the President recalled, he made this point in an interview, noting that the country persists with lax gun laws despite repeated mass killings. “And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana.

It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out.

"“What’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere, will comment and say, ‘Obama politicized this issue,’ ” the President said. “Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.” He challenged news organizations to “tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.” He went on: “We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so.

"The Republican Party has long exercised a veto on any meaningful addition to the gun laws. And among its current crop of Presidential candidates, there is no sign of anybody breaking ranks. Reaction to the shooting ranged from nonexistent to predictably depressing. As far as I could see, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina, the third- and fourth-place candidates in the polls, didn’t say anything on Thursday about what had happened in Oregon. In a message on Twitter, Jeb Bush called the massacre a “senseless tragedy.” Donald Trump, in an interview with the Washington Post, referred to it as a “terrible tragedy.” He also said, “It sounds like another mental-health problem. So many of these people, they’re coming out of the woodwork.” Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, took a similar line. “Obviously, there are those who are going to be calling for gun control,” he said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.”","3214","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is a familiar trope, of course: it’s not the guns that are the problem, it’s the shooters. There was no suggestion from anybody on the Republican side that what had happened might justify a reconsideration of gun laws, let alone a significant recasting of them. Even those G.O.P. candidates who have previously expressed support for some forms of gun control, such as Chris Christie and George Pataki, didn’t have anything to say on that subject.","3215","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Democratic candidates, by contrast, were united in calling for action. Speaking to reporters in Massachusetts, Hillary Clinton said, “We have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe.” She suggested that it wasn’t a hopeless task: “I know there is a way to have sensible gun-control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, and save lives. And I am committed to doing everything I can to achieve that.” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said in a tweet, “Tweets won’t stop this. Thoughts and prayers won’t either. Only real gun reforms will stop mass shootings from occurring nearly every day.” Bernie Sanders, who has been accused by Clinton allies of shifting his positions on gun control, called for “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.”","3216","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"But Democrats aren’t entirely blameless. After experiencing a political backlash during the nineteen-nineties, when the Clinton Administration pushed through gun-control measures that included a ban on assault weapons, too many members of the Party adopted a craven approach as, during the Bush years, Republicans in Congress rolled back some of the reforms. Even President Obama, who urged for stricter gun control during his 2008 campaign, can’t entirely escape criticism. During his first term, when for two years the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, his Administration didn’t propose any actual gun-control legislation. It wasn’t until 2013, after the massacre in Newtown, that the White House made a serious effort to persuade Congress to act—one that failed in the face of implacable Republican opposition.","3217","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"

"Rubio was prepared. He’d already demonstrated that fact by seeking to turn Quintanilla’s question into an attack on the media, a tactic that many Republicans adopt when they’re under fire, because it often works for them. First, Rubio pointed out that one of his Democratic predecessors, Bob Graham, missed more than thirty per cent of his votes in the Senate, in 2004, when he ran for President. Then he said that John Kerry and Barack Obama—two more senators who ran for the White House—missed even more votes than Graham did. “So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement,” Rubio said.","3223","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"That response earned him loud cheers from the crowd. Bush waded in with his admonishments anyway. When the former Florida governor had finished, Rubio said, “I get to respond, right?” Becky Quick, another of the moderators, told him he had thirty seconds. “Well, it’s interesting,” Rubio began. “Over the last few weeks, I’ve listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you’re modelling your campaign after John McCain, that you’re going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.

"Rather than answering the question, or doing something else to knock Rubio off balance, Bush said that McCain wasn’t his senator. “Well, let me tell you,” Rubio said. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s vote record. The only reason why you’re doing it now is because we’re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.” Bush mumbled something, but the applause for Rubio virtually drowned him out. “Here’s the bottom line,” Rubio went on. “My campaign is going to be about the future of America; it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. I’m not running against Governor Bush. I’m not running against anyone on this stage. I’m running for President because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.”","3225","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"I wrote all of this down at length because it was what the political pros call “a moment”—something that lasts for more than one news cycle and helps define the event in the public consciousness—which is what all of the debaters are seeking. In attacking his fellow-Floridian, Bush was clearly looking for a moment to change the narrative of his sagging campaign. But because Rubio was sharper and better prepared—he had clearly come with the McCain answer in his pocket, in case Bush attacked him—the moment turned out to be his.","3226","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"In fact, it may have been more than “a” moment. If you believe some of the commentators who were waxing lyrical about Rubio’s performance after the debate, it was “the” moment in which he publicly confirmed that he has displaced Bush as the regular politician most likely to be the Republican nominee. The Fix, one of the Washington Post’s political blogs, ran a piece headlined “How Marco Rubio owned Jeb Bush in Wednesday’s GOP debate.” At The New Republic, Brian Beutler suggested that Bush should do himself and the G.O.P. a favor by dropping out of the race.","3227","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"That’s laying it on thick. Bush kept his cool, and his campaign is right when it says that this contest is a marathon. But when your best-received line is “I’m seven-and-oh in my fantasy-football league,” in response to a question about whether fantasy sports is gambling, the night can only be classified as another disappointment. Rubio, on the other hand, went on to deliver several more zingers. In a debate in which most of the candidates seemed at least as intent on attacking the media as the Democrats, he also managed to link together the G.O.P.’s two main demons.","3228","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Picking up on a comment from Donald Trump about super PACs, Rubio said, “The Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It is called the mainstream media.” With that, he went into a little spiel about the favorable coverage that Hillary Clinton’s appearance before the Benghazi committee received, claiming, “It was the week she got exposed as a liar”—a reference to public statements Clinton made linking the attack on U.S. installations in Libya with an anti-Muslim video. “But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.” Given the well-known antagonism between the Clinton campaign and parts of the mainstream media, including the New York Times, this was an outrageous charge, but it was one that will play well on conservative talk shows.","3229","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Another candidate who got in some radio-ready sound bites was Ted Cruz. The forty-four-year-old Texas senator received the biggest cheer of the night for a rant about the (mostly perfectly reasonable and often commendably specific) questions that the CNBC moderators were asking. “The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks,” he said. Right now, Cruz is not a major threat to Rubio, but on the basis of this debate he could eventually become one.","3230","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"The two men who are currently leading in the polls—Donald Trump and Ben Carson—both had relatively quiet nights. In the case of Carson, who has dismissed the debates as boxing matches, that may not have been a bad thing. As always, he kept calm. He parried a couple of policy questions, denied that he is a homophobe, criticized political correctness, and delivered a couple of uplifting passages about American values. Luckily for him, nobody asked him to explain his statements connecting gun control with the Holocaust. Even if someone had, it might not have made much difference. Whatever is driving Carson’s rise, it isn’t dynamism on the debating stage.","3231","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Trump disappeared for long stretches, as he did in the second debate. At one point, after he was asked how he would cut taxes by ten trillion dollars without raising the deficit, he looked lost. But he has looked lost before, and it hasn’t done him much harm. Having apparently made a strategic decision not to criticize Carson, who has passed him in one national poll, he saved his venom for John Kasich, who had the temerity to question the practicality of Trump’s desire to deport eleven million undocumented immigrants. “This was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes,” Trump told the audience. (Actually, as Kasich pointed out, although he did work for Lehman, he wasn’t a partner.)","3232","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"

"In 1947, when Elaine Slott was sixteen, she travelled with her mother and sister to visit her aunt and uncle in Florida. The day after they arrived, however, Elaine and her aunt boarded another plane by themselves. Elaine soon found herself speeding to Cuba, where the family had business interests. Elaine remembers that night well. After they landed, she and her aunt left Havana and drove for several hours into areas that seemed increasingly remote. It was very late and very dark when they finally arrived at a stately house. Along with a few guests, a number of family members, including Elaine’s uncle, had gathered there for a dinner party. Their host, who had been cooking pasta, emerged from the kitchen wearing a white apron. He introduced himself to Elaine as Charlie.","September 16, 2015","3235","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"Over dinner, Charlie was charming. He personally brought out and served all of the food. After appetizers came the pasta, and Elaine found herself staring down at a plate she had assumed was meant to be shared by everyone at the table. “I could never eat all this!” she declared. Charlie laughed and proposed a wager: he’d give her two dollars if she ate it all. Another guest immediately joined in: another two dollars for the girl. Elaine had no pocket money, and wanted to buy some souvenirs for her sister, who was still back in Florida. So she ate the whole plate. There were cheers. She was paid in full. On her way home, she bought the souvenirs. She didn’t give it another thought.","3236","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"Several weeks later, a photograph in a newspaper caught her eye. It showed a man who seemed intriguingly familiar. Above it was a headline about the infamous Charles “Lucky” Luciano. He’d been captured in Cuba and was being deported to Italy. “Ma, why didn’t you tell me who it was?” Elaine demanded. “It’s not important that you know everything,” her mother replied. Elaine shouldn’t have been too surprised: the uncle she visited in Florida was Meyer Lansky. That night, he’d sent his niece and his wife to see his best friend.","3237","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"A few weeks ago, Slott, a diminutive, delicate octogenarian, recalled those days wistfully over steak at the première of AMC’s “The Making of the Mob,” a docu-drama about the early years of organized crime, when Lucky, Meyer, and Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel ruled the land. She remembers Charlie as a gentleman and her uncle as a charismatic, loving person who cared deeply for his family. Meyer Lansky’s grandson, Meyer Lansky II, a fifty-eight-year-old former casino operator who was sitting at the same table, said that he felt the same way. He remembers walking with his grandpa on the beach in Miami and listening to his business advice. His granddad was a kind, peaceful man—and, Lansky II is quick to stress, he never got his hands dirty. (Or so it’s said.)","3238","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"It’s no surprise that family members paint idyllic pictures of their mobster ancestors. Every mobster was also a father, brother, uncle, or grandfather, and—at least theoretically—his villainy didn’t spill over into those roles. The real question is why so many other people feel the same way. We don’t glamorize all violent crime; no one holds the Son of Sam or Charles Manson in high regard. (It’s hard to imagine their descendants gathering for a celebratory dinner at a steakhouse.) So why are Al Capone, Lansky, Arnold Rothstein, Luciano, and their ilk held up as mythic figures, even heroes of a sort, not just by their families but by the general public? Why are members of the Italian mafia treated more like celebrities than unsavory criminals?","3239","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"Part of the answer is historical. According to James Finckenauer, an emeritus professor at Rutgers University and the author of “Mafia and Organized Crime: A Beginner’s Guide,” the glamorization of the mob started with Prohibition. In the early years of the twentieth century, mobsters were just small-time operators. Then came the Volstead Act, which outlawed alcohol. “One of the side effects was to solidify organized crime and create a real, international organization out of what was, in essence, small criminal groups,” Finckenauer told me. Because Prohibition was hugely unpopular, the men who stood up to it were heralded as heroes, not criminals. “It was the start of their image as people who can thumb their noses at bad laws and at the establishment,” Finckenauer said. Even when Prohibition was repealed and the services of the bootleggers were no longer required, that initial positive image stuck. Books like Mario Puzo’s “The Godfather” communicated the idea that mobsters were men who cared about the happiness of their communities and who lived by their own codes of honor and conduct, impervious to the political whims of the establishment.","3240","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"The specific immigrant identities of the original mobsters also made them easier to admire. With the significant exceptions of Meyer Lansky and Arnold Rothstein, the original high-profile mafiosos were, by and large, Italians. And, even as late as the nineteen-twenties, Italians and Italian-Americans were often considered “other” by much of the rest of the country. In fact, many people subscribed to what criminologists call the alien conspiracy theory of organized crime—the idea, as Finckenauer puts it, that “Southern Italians came to us with evil intent to create criminal enterprise on our shores.” (Today, Donald Trump advances a similar theory about immigrants from south of the border.) That outsized sense of Italians’ otherness, combined with the idea that the mob’s rigid rules precluded the involvement of outsiders, made mobsters less threatening. “By and large, people are under the impression that if they don’t have any dealings with stuff the mob deals with—no drugs, no borrowing money, no illegal gaming—they have nothing to fear from organized crime,” Finckenauer said. Because their violence seemed directed at their own communities, not anyone else’s, it was easy to romanticize.","3241","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"Social psychologists have long distinguished between “in-groups” and “out-groups.” Out-groups come in different guises. There are some with whom we feel absolutely no affinity; often, we separate ourselves from them by putting them down. But other out-groups are enough like our in-group that, although their identity remains separate from ours, they seem like less of a threat, It is to this second category that the mafia belongs. People who see themselves as “all-American” can be fascinated by Italian mobsters, and even admire them, without worrying that their lives will come into contact with mobsters’ lives. It’s no coincidence that the other glamorized mob figures in the U.S. are Irish: from “The Departed” to the forthcoming Whitey Bulger biopic “Black Mass,” they’re presented as similar enough for sympathy, yet different enough for a false sense of safety to creep in. For reasons of language, culture, and race, members of the Chinese and Russian mob have proven harder to romanticize.","3242","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"Ultimately, the mob myth depends on psychological distance, a term coined by the New York University psychologist Yaacov Trope to describe the phenomenon of mental distancing that takes place when we separate ourselves from events, people, emotions, or concepts. In some cases, that distance comes naturally. As painful events recede into the past, our perceptions soften; when we physically remove ourselves from emotionally disturbing situations, our emotions cool. In other cases, we need to deliberately cultivate distance—to “gain perspective.” Trope likens it to the old cliché of missing the forest for the trees: you can wander around in the trees forever or, through training or external intervention, realize that you need to step back to see the full vista.","3243","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"Once attained, psychological distance allows us to romanticize and feel nostalgia for almost anything. It provides a filter, eliminating some details and emphasizing others. We speak of the good old days, hardly ever of the bad. Psychological distance is, among other things, a coping mechanism: it protects against depression and its close cousin, rumination, which pushes us to dwell too long on unpleasant details from the past instead of moving forward. When, instead, we smooth the edges of the past, remembering it as better than it was, we end up hoping for an equally happy future.","3244","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"But psychological distance doesn’t require time. Under the right conditions, it can flourish in the moment. The psychological distance provided by “otherness” mimics the distance provided by time. It’s not a phenomenon unique to the mafia. It’s easy to glamorize warfare when there is no draft, or to idealize anyone whose life style seems risky and edgy without putting you, personally, at risk—spies and secret agents, rebels without a cause, the beatniks of Jack Kerouac’s “On The Road.” As long as there isn’t an easy-to-recall, factual reminder that brings us down out of the clouds of romanticism, we can glamorize at will. The lives of serial killers offer those concrete reminders: they lurk in neighborhoods like ours, threatening people who could be us. The mob is more abstract: it’s a shadowy, vague “organization” whose illicit dealings don’t really impinge on us. Abstraction lends itself to psychological distance; specificity kills it.","3245","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"
"We grant mobsters dignity because we enjoy contemplating the general principles by which they are supposed to have lived: omertà, standing up to unfair authority, protecting your own. Those principles are what you see and hear when you watch Lansky and Luciano’s golden years reënacted in the “The Making of the Mob,” or when you follow Whitey Bulger’s takeover of Boston in “Black Mass.” In the same way, when Meyer II or Elaine Slott speaks to me about the past, I hear echoes of greatness—of lofty ideals and grand ambition, of important principles that the cold world didn’t always uphold. That dinner in Cuba is recalled as an illustration of friendship and family: Lucky was just a man making good, torn from the people he loved so the U.S. could make a political statement. Because they’re related to him, Lucky Luciano’s familiars see him as a principled man worthy of our admiration instead of a criminal deserving of our disdain. Psychological distance allows us to see him this way, too. It makes us part of the family.","3246","http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-do-we-admire-mobsters"

The second of twelve children, he grew up in a modest two-bedroom house in Cincinnati. (He and his siblings took the bedrooms; his parents slept on a sofa bed.) From a young age, he helped out in the family’s bar, Andy’s Café, which his grandfather founded, in 1938, and his father ran for forty-five years. After being discharged from the United States Navy with a bad back, Boehner took seven years to work his way through Xavier University, getting a bachelor’s degree in business administration. With his cigarettes, his perma-tan, his French cuffs, and his Midwestern good manners (on Friday, President Obama called him a “good man” who had always treated him courteously), Boehner often seemed like a politician from another time.","3269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-boehner-a-man-out-of-time"

The partial shutdown, which began in October, lasted sixteen days, and, sure enough, Congress’s approval ratings fell into single digits. A couple of months later, when conservative groups started causing more trouble, once again over the budget, Boehner finally lashed out publicly, calling them “ridiculous” and saying, “They pushed us into this fight to defund Obamacare and to shut down the government.
