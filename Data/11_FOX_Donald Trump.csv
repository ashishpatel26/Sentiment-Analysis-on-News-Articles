"Donald Trump is riding to the rescue — of the country (as he sees it), of the Republicans (as few see it), of the media (as I see it).","Published February 27, 2015","4","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"Not that the 2016 campaign has lacked for drama, but Trump always brings bigger, better and louder production values.","5","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"The question, as always, is whether this is another elaborate head fake, a temporary foray into the silly season.","6","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"Trump speaks Friday to a CPAC gathering where there has been no shortage of media-bashing. When I was out at the conference at Maryland's National Harbor, I heard Chris Christie say he doesn’t subscribe to the New York Times. I heard Rep. Marsha Blackburn tick off the names of the television networks: CNN (Clinton News Network), NBC (Nobody But Clinton), CBS (Clinton BS network...) And while Scott Walker mostly bashed Washington, he said in a USA Friday op-ed that “when we refuse to take the media's bait, we suffer….","7","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"

"The Donald has a strangely symbiotic relationship with the media. He loves the attention, basks in the spotlight, has a genius for generating headlines. At the same time he loves to pick fights with journalists, attack them on Twitter, and assume the role of aggrieved party.","9","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"Right now he is courting the media, or at least trying to persuade them that he may well be a full-fledged presidential candidate this time around. Never mind that Trump makes these noises every four years. Never mind that he sustained the tease for a long period in 2011, before re-upping his NBC deal for ""The Apprentice.""","10","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"Trump told the Washington Post he is “more serious” this time:","11","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"“Everybody feels I’m doing this just to have fun or because it’s good for the brand,” he said. “Well, it’s not fun. I’m not doing this for enjoyment. I’m doing this because the country is in serious trouble.”","12","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"But the press pack remains skeptical, and as much as I'd enjoy covering a campaign of Trumpian dimensions, I'm in that camp as well. A zillionaire is going to put himself through a two-year grind, share a stage with a dozen or two dozen opponents, and disclose his finances?","13","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"Let's say Trump actually does run. His approval ratings are lousy: 68 percent unfavorable among Iowa Republicans, 69 percent unfavorable among New Hampshire Republicans. So there’s not exactly a draft.","14","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"Trump is the epitome of the 1 percent. He lost plenty of luster when he touted the birther questions against President Obama. Some of his casinos have gone bankrupt. And what happens when the press starts digging into his business dealings and tax breaks?","15","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"Some people will undoubtedly be drawn to his bombastic style and us-and-them rhetoric. He can blanket the airwaves with ads and not have to beg a bunch of donors for cash.","16","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"But Trump is 68, slightly older than Hillary, and has long since come to be viewed as an entertainer who dabbles in politics. Can he turn that image around?","17","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"
"Trump probably benefits more from the flirtation phase of 2016 than the consummation phase. I suspect that before long he’ll be back on TV firing people. But I’m happy to be proven wrong.","18","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/trumps-tantalizing-talk-running-why-media-arent-buying.html"

"Buzz Cut: • Spite toward Bibi ‘hardened’ Obama’s resolve to do Iran nuke deal • Racism claim shows Senate Dems’ blockade weakening • Archives wants answers from Hillary • Walker riding a tiger in S.C. • The place to be","123","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/19/spite-toward-bibi-hardened-obamas-resolve-to-do-iran-nuke-deal.html"
"SPITE TOWARD BIBI “HARDENED” OBAMA’S RESOLVE TO DO IRAN NUKE DEAL NYT: “[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s] objections to a nuclear deal with Iran, and his decision to firmly ally himself with Mr. Obama’s Republican opponents in expressing his ire over the Iran talks, may well have hardened the president’s decision to push for an agreement, one Obama adviser said Wednesday.” [Watch Fox: Netanyahu will be interviewed by Megyn Kelly, airing on “The Kelly File” tonight at 9 p.m. ET] White House steps up attacks - Fox News: “ In its first public response to Netanyahu's election triumph, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama still believes in a two-state solution. This was after Netanyahu, shortly before the vote, reversed his stance and stated he would not allow the creation of a Palestinian state. Earnest acknowledged Wednesday that the U.S. would have to ‘re-evaluate’ its position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in light of those comments…And State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki clarified that the administration ‘absolutely’ will continue to push for this. Further, Earnest chided Netanyahu's Likud Party on Wednesday, saying the White House was ‘deeply concerned’ about divisive language emanating from Likud. He said the party had sought to marginalize Israel's minority Arabs, an apparent reference to social media posts the Likud distributed that warned Israelis about the danger of high turnout by Arab voters.” RACISM CLAIM SHOWS SENATE DEMS’ BLOCKADE WEAKENING You’ve got to give credit to Senate Democrats – not exactly a Rainbow Coalition of diversity – for chutzpah when it comes to making claims of racism. Their argument is that by delaying the confirmation vote for Loretta Lynch as attorney general, Republicans are sending her to the “back of the bus.” Of course, as long as she isn’t confirmed, who stays as attorney general? Must be some white dude. Well, not exactly. So what’s up here? The reality is that Republicans are trying to force Democrats to accept language in a human trafficking bill that bans the use of federal fees to fund abortions. Democrats called it a sneak attack, since they voted to advance the legislation without reading it. Democrats say the provision should be undone without them being forced into a potentially damaging vote in favor of federally funded abortions during the amendment process. The Democratic blockade is weakening today with the admission from a top staffer that she had seen the abortion-funding language but failed to bring it to her boss’ attention. So Republicans are hoping that by delaying the vote on Lynch, Democrats will feel more pressure to drop their filibuster in defense of the federal abortion funding. Under different circumstances, this wouldn’t be possible for the GOP. But the political consequences of delaying filling a key position have been lessened by the fact that the office is not vacant. Eric Holder is on the job. He’d like to go, but the president can hardly say that the office isn’t in good hands. The Democrats want a fast vote, but don’t really need one. The counterattack is to claim it is racism, usually the best sign that Democrats are losing an argument. And replacing black attorney general with another isn’t exactly Selma, so it’s a difficult case to make. And when it’s transparently about the standard wrangling of Senate votes and calendars, it’s even harder to make stick. NATIONAL ARCHIVES WANTS ANSWERS FROM HILLARY Politico: “The National Archives has formally asked the State Department to explain how Hillary Clinton’s emails as secretary of state ended up on her private email server rather than a government system. In a letter sent earlier this month and obtained Wednesday by POLITICO, National Archives and Records Administration official Paul Wester asked State to report on whether federal records had been ‘alienated’ and what steps the agency is taking to address the situation. ‘NARA is concerned that Federal records may have been alienated from the Department of State’s official recordkeeping systems,’ Wester wrote to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Margaret Grafeld.” [WashEx: “Add the Keystone XL oil pipeline to Benghazi and Clinton Foundation fundraising as subject lines being sought in legal cases against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her missing emails. The liberal Friends of the Earth Wednesday filed a Freedom of Information Act demand for emails that they say Clinton never produced under an earlier request.”] Double standard - Daily Caller: “Failure to sign a formal separation agreement can have dire consequences for rank-and-file State Department employees, an agency whistle-blower told The Daily Caller. That is in stark contrast to what happens to top-level officials such as former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton if they refuse to sign the separation form, OF-109. Ramifications for lower-level State Department employees include the withholding of retirement benefits and possible investigations conducted by the agency into why employees declined to sign the form, whistle-blower Richard Higbie says. By signing OF-109, agency employees affirm that they have turned over all records - classified or unclassified; emails or physical documents - pertaining to official government business. Whether or not Clinton - who used a private email account hosted on a private server to conduct official business - signed the document when she left office in Feb. 2013 was finally answered on Tuesday by State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.” [Clinton is in Atlantic City, N.J. today to give a paid speech to the industry group that represents summer camps.] Running against GOP Congress already - Hey, what happened to the “warm purple space?” WaPo: “[Clinton] is already running her presidential campaign, against the Republican Congress. And the GOP is only happy to oblige. The prospective 2016 Democratic candidate is seeking to use the priorities and record of congressional Republicans as a foil, highlighting early GOP stumbles and attempting to change the subject after weeks of rough media coverage of her private e-mail system and of foreign donations to her family’s foundation. In blasts of rapid-fire Twitter messages just this week, Clinton accused Republicans of waging a war on women, playing politics with a black nominee, shortchanging students, endangering the economic recovery and trying to yank health-care coverage for 16 million Americans…” Sixteen Iowa Democratic leaders urge Warren to run - Des Moines Register: “A small number of Iowa Democratic leaders have signed a letter calling for Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president, signaling that they crave a challenger to the Democratic favorite, Hillary Clinton. Sixteen Iowa leaders, one elected official, one former elected official, four current county party chairs and several other leading activists, added their name to the letter released by Run Warren Run, an effort organized by MoveOn.org Political Action and Democracy for America. ‘We need leaders who aren't afraid to tell the truth and fight back, no matter what powerful interests say, and we need all the candidates in the caucus to offer a bold vision for an economy that works for all Americans,’ says the letter, which was shared with The Des Moines Register Wednesday morning.” The Judge’s Ruling - From the danger to national security to a lack of compliance with federal records laws, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst JudgeAndrew Napolitano ponders the legal jeopardy Hillary Clinton email scandal presents and asks: “What if all this lawlessness and secrecy was orchestrated by Clinton herself -- a person devoid of a moral compass and disdainful of compliance with law and a habitual stranger to the truth? What if she is presently the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president? What if the Democrats don’t care?” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Appalachia is the scene of flooding each spring, as melting snow mixes with rain and overwhelms narrow river valleys. But before dams and floodwalls were built to control the torrents, major rivers also frequently flooded. And if you had been in Pittsburgh on this day in 1936, you would have seen the aftermath of the worst of them all. Floods, triggered by rain and the rapid melting of heavy snows surged through the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers, which meet at Pittsburgh to form the Ohio. The steel capital of the world was inundated with rivers running 21 feet above flood stage, wiping out much of the crowded downtown and ruining the U.S. Steel plants on the banks of the rivers. Authorities estimated 45 people were killed in Pittsburgh and thousands were left without homes or work as the country watched newsreels of the devastation. But what began in Pittsburgh would wreak even more damage downriver, especially in West Virginia. As many as 150 more people would be killed and whole communities were wiped out. The same conditions brought terrible flooding on the other side of the Eastern Continental Divide as well, with devastating results all the way from New England to Washington, D.C. So, if you are tempted to complain about the weather… Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 44.9 percent//Disapprove – 50.9 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 31.7 percent//Wrong Track – 58.7 percent WALKER RIDING A TIGER IN SOUTH CAROLINA Is the “honeymoon over” for Scott Walker’s candidacy? Did he “get rolled” by the Iowa establishment? Is the “implosion” beginning? Nope, but the push against Walker from the right is certainly underway. His fast rise produced lots of scrutiny from the left, but now Walker is getting heat from the right as conservatives mull whether they’re ready to settle on the Wisconsin governor, or if they would like to try a different candidate to try to block establishment pick Jeb Bush. This isn’t unexpected, but neither is the question it prompts: How well how does he weather the storm? Walker heads to South Carolina for events in Columbia and Greenville today, and as he goes he will surely face more questions about his prior positions on immigration and farm subsidies. If Walker gets branded as a flip-flopper, he could have a crisis on his hands. With attacks coming from all sides and lots of frustrated conservative candidates jostling for the top anti-Bush slot, this could get ugly fast. These purity tests could either be the start of Walker’s next rise, or the opening of the way forward for Bush. The former Florida governor needs conservative Republicans to cycle through a series of potential candidates, tearing each one apart for apostate views. That keeps the focus off of Bush and let him play the kind of whack a mole game that Mitt Romney did against a series of successively weaker opponents. If the party aims to block Bush, conservatives don't have a tremendous amount of time to make their choice. With two favorite sons competing, Florida moves to delay primary - AP: “Florida has spent years fighting for its status as the fifth and final early presidential primary state, giving it remarkable clout in determining presidential nominees. But with former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio both competing, Florida is moving out of the spotlight. A bill just passed by the state Senate would move the vote to March 15, the first day states are permitted to hold winner-take-all Republican primaries. Republican Gov. Rick Scott is expected to sign the bill. That means rather than a potential boost to for Bush or Rubio in the early going, state voters can wait to see who’s ahead after the first six weeks of voting.” WaPo digs up Jeb’s 1985 business deal turned bad - WaPo: “Jeb Bush was a young man building a real estate business in Miami in 1985 when health-care entrepreneur Miguel Recarey Jr. hired him to help locate office space in South Florida. Bush, then the son of the vice president, later provided another service: opening doors in Washington, where Recarey had mounted an aggressive lobbying effort for a waiver from Medicare rules that would allow his fast-growing company to continue to expand. Recarey got what he wanted. But two years later, the firm, International Medical Centers, was shut down as regulators searched for millions in missing federal funds. Facing charges of bribery and bilking Medicare, Recarey fled the country to avoid prosecution. He remains a fugitive in Spain, where a court denied U.S. requests for extradition.” Moolah machine - Bush has landed Mason J. Fink to serve as national fundraising chair. Fink previously served as national finance director of Mitt Romney’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. Bush is raising money in Atlanta today. Meanwhile back in Florida, Bush’s Right to Rise PAC is hosting a fundraiser featuring his son, Jeb Bush Jr. How Rand’s digital team helped re-elect Bibi - Bloomberg: “Four days before the Israeli polls closed, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a 35-second video message. It was addressed to conservatives, but anyone could watch the dire warning. ‘There exists a very real danger that Tzipi Livni and Buji Herzog will be the next prime ministers of Israel with the support of the Arabs,’ said Netanyahu, referring to the leaders of the Zionist Union party that had passed his Likud in the polls. ‘Supporters of the national party don't have the privilege of voting for the other parties which are not the Likud.’ ‘The only thing similar to [an Israeli election] in the United States is a crowded presidential primary.’…Among the victors in this week's election are Vincent Harris and Michael Duncan, leaders of the firm who took the Likud account and used social media to organize and turn out Netanyahu's vote.” Cruz picks a fight on abortion, gay student groups - WaPo: “Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a conservative torchbearer and potential presidential contender, turned his attention to local D.C. politics Wednesday by introducing a measure in Congress to upend one new city law regarding discrimination over [birth control and abortion] and another to keep religiously affiliated colleges in the nation’s capital from having to fund gay and lesbian student groups. The measures, known as disapproval resolutions, could in theory halt local laws passed last year by the D.C. Council and signed by the city’s mayor. But to do so, Cruz’s measures would require support of both chambers of Congress and the signature of President Obama.” Kasich: ‘I’m suited up’ - In his latest column, George Will examines the strategies for Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, should he jump into the 2016 race. “Ideas fly from Governor John Kasich like sparks from a flint. While explaining his prison reforms, he interrupts himself mid-sentence, his sentences, like some E. E. Cummings poems, are unpunctuated, to praise a Delaware church that buys prom dresses for low-income high-school girls. His spirit would add spice and his policies would add substance to the Republican presidential contest. But only if Jeb Bush fails to gain momentum commensurate with his fundraising… His sometimes sandpapery personality actually might be a sign of authenticity that helps him connect with people who, he says, think ‘he understands my problems and he kind of gets me.’ There will be, he insists, other ‘twists and turns’ in the path to the Republican nomination, and like a football player on the bench, ‘I’m suited up.’” Burn rate: Perry goes deep on Iowa - Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry has added a fifth Iowa political operative in longtime GOP activist Jaime Johnson. Johnson is known for his work in evangelical Christian circles as well as among social and economic conservatives, working for Rick Santorum in 2012. Perry begins a two day swing through Iowa with a speech for the Dallas County Republicans today. Huckabee wraps - Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee wraps up his Iowa swing with two stops this morning before heading out west to Montana. Conservatives may face Trump test - Donald Trump is in New Hampshire today following his announcement that he is launching a presidential exploratory committee. If Trump actually is serious rather than just jousting with NBC over his reality show contract, it could be a mild difficulty for conservative Republicans. If you think having to answer for what Rudy Giuliani has to say, imagine facing questions on the trail about a person who makes a living being bombastic and likes to take hugely controversial positions. Reporters would be doubly interested. These aren’t just good “gotcha” question, but the Trump name draws instant attention and clicks. In 2012, conservative Republicans were undisciplined. As a result, they grudgingly nominated and moderate candidate who was further weakened going into the general election. Trump’s candidacy is a good test for the degree of discipline that conservative voters have this time around. TWO IN FOR SCHOCK’S SEAT, MORE MAY COME (Springfield, Ill.) State Journal-Register: “The field to replace U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock in Congress stood at two on Wednesday night, though several potential competitors were still weighing their options. With an announcement on Peoria radio station WMBD-AM 1470 Wednesday morning, state Sen. Darin LaHood, R-Dunlap, became the early favorite to win his party's nomination to replace the embattled Peoria lawmaker who is resigning March 31…The only other announced candidate is former Chillicothe attorney Mark Zalcman, who now lives just blocks outside the district in Normal. He had previously announced a challenge to Schock in next year's primary and said Tuesday that he would seek the seat in the special election instead.” THE PLACE TO BE AP: “An upstate New York county of 76,000 people has gotten its second $100 million-plus Mega Millions jackpot winner in three months. Real estate agent Tammy Pratt of South Fallsburg in Sullivan County was introduced Wednesday as the sole winner of the $126 million Mega Millions jackpot drawn Feb. 27. Pratt was between real estate appointments when she stopped for gas. She bought $4 worth of tickets instead of her usual $1 when she noticed the jackpot for the upcoming drawing had topped $100 million. Lottery officials say the odds of hitting that jackpot were 1 in 258 million. In January, a retired school principal from Wurtsboro in Sullivan County was announced as the sole winner of a $326 million Mega Millions jackpot drawn in November.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “Well it was a big victory for [Benjamin Netanyahu] personally. And I think the reaction of the administration is now reaching levels where it has become unseemly. The pettiness and the petulance with which they are discussing the election…Look, it’s clear that Obama loathes Netanyahu more than any other world leader, meaning more than the Ayatollah in Iran or Putin in Russia. And he did everything he could to unseat him, but he failed.” —Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here. Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"Buzz Cut: • Scandals skewer Hillary in swing states • Rand hits back hard on abortion • Walker: Obama has no business ‘schooling anyone’ on foreign policy • Bloomberg adds coal to his hit list • The road to Appomattox began with political failure","156","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/09/scandals-skewer-hillary-in-swing-states.html"
"SCANDALS SKEWER HILLARY IN SWING STATES As news of another suspect foreign entanglement hits Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a new survey shows how damaging the fallout from her scandal twin-bill of secret email servers and foreign buckraking have been. A Quinnipiac University poll out today says Clinton’s lead is collapsing against leading Republican presidential candidates in the critical swing states of Colorado, Iowa and Virginia. The size of the drop from Q’s mid-February survey, coupled with gains by the entire GOP field leads the pollster to conclude, “[I]t is difficult to see Secretary Clinton’s slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail.” Respondents in all three states say she is not honest and trustworthy. Nasty numbers - In matchups, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., drew 44 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent in Colorado, as he and 5 other GOP hopefuls statistically tied the Democratic frontrunner. In Iowa, Paul at 43 percent, has a numerical edge over Clinton’s 42 percent, with the rest of the field effectively tied or close. Clinton fared better in Virginia, with a 47 to 43 percent lead over Paul, her closest GOP rival. About that email policy… - WaPo: “…Clinton has hired a longtime Google executive to oversee her likely presidential campaign's technology development and build new ways for Clinton to engage with voters, according to Democrats with knowledge of the move. Stephanie Hannon, who is Google's director of product management for civic innovation and social impact, will become the chief technology officer of the expected Clinton campaign…’ Move in day? - In a signal a campaign announcement is nearing from Hillary Clinton, sources tell Fox News some staffers for the former Secretary of State started moving into her Brooklyn, N.Y. headquarters Wednesday. [Watch Fox: Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry is in Iowa examining the groundwork being laid by Clinton.] RAND HITS BACK HARD ON ABORTION During a campaign stop in Milford, N.H., Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., responded to a question about a testy exchange he had with an AP reporter about abortion policy. Paul’s retort: “You go back and go ask (DNC head) Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she’s OK with killing a 7-pound baby that's just not born yet.” Paul added, “Ask her when life begins, and ask Debbie when she’s willing to protect life. When you get an answer from Debbie, come back to me.” Wasserman Schultz shot back responding, “I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved. Period. End of story.” Zero exceptions? - “It’s disturbing to know that the Chairwoman of the DNC supports zero protections for the life of an unborn child, not even in the final days before birth. We should be willing to protect the innocent. Do her fellow Democrats share their party chair’s position, which is out-of-step with the majority of American women?”—Republican National Committee Press Secretary, Allison Moore in a statement. [According to the most recent Gallup Poll, only 28 percent of respondents believe abortion should be legal under “any circumstance.”] ‘People want someone who will stand up’ - During an appearance on “The Kelly File” Wednesday night Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., defended his demeanor in recent interviews telling host Megyn Kelly, “Do I think that I responded appropriately? You know, I would rather not have contentious interviews. I would rather do 30 minutes with Charlie Rose laid back in a La-Z-Boy chair. I know, but we only get a few minutes. There’s not a lot of time for niceties.” Paul went on to say, “I think also that people want someone who will stand up and not just roll over and take it.” The Hill: “Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has raised $1 million in donations through his website to a day after officially launching his presidential campaign.” NRA snubs Christie and Rand - The Tennessean: “A dozen or so possible Republican presidential candidates are set to speak in Nashville on Friday at the National Rifle Association's annual convention — but the lineup is missing two big names. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky…Neither were invited to addresses the NRA’s Leadership Forum, NRA officials confirmed to The Tennessean. … Christie… was given a ‘C’ by the NRA in 2013, prior to his re-election. Earlier that year, Christie blasted the NRA for airing what he called a ‘reprehensible’ television ad that mentioned the daughters of President Barack Obama.” [Why would the NRA exclude Paul, whose record on gun rights is pristine? The Daily Beast explains that it is his support for other, more conservative firearms groups.] The Lineup at NRA: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., Dr. Ben Carson, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., Gov. Bobby Jindal, R-La., Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., Gov. Mike Pence, R-Ind., former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., reality show host Donald Trump and 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Pro-military appeal in the Palmetto State- The [South Carolina] Herald: “Some prominent Palmetto State Republicans will accompany White House hopeful Rand Paul when he launches his South Carolina primary race Thursday at the U.S.S. Yorktown. For the U.S. senator from Kentucky, who is trying to dispel concerns that he is too isolationist, the choice of the aircraft carrier as a backdrop offers the chance to appeal to pro-military S.C. voters. U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., and state Sen. Tom Davis are expected to give remarks at Paul’s event. U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., will not attend but has contributed a video.” WALKER: OBAMA HAS NO BUSINESS ‘SCHOOLING ANYONE’ ON FOREIGN POLICY Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., shot back at President Obama’s criticism of his foreign policy experience during an appearance on “Hannity” Wednesday. “This is a guy who has the audacity to be talking about schooling anyone when it comes to foreign policy and not just about Israel and nuclear weapons,” Walker told host Sean Hannity. “The thing about that statement, a guy in the last year called ISIS, the jayvee squad, his administration continues to call Yemen a success story, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave Russia a reset button.” Watch the interview here. Jeb goes for big bucks in Boston - Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., heads to the Bay State today to shake the money tree at the Boston area home of his cousin, Athena Health CEO, Jonathan Bush. Founder of Carruth Capital, Christopher Egan, is co-hosting the $10,000 ticket event with Bush’s cousin. Huckabee shoots, scores - Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., released a Web ad Wednesday comparing the threat of Islamic jihad to a rattlesnake. Huckabee appears in the ad saying: “As a kid growing up in South Arkansas, one thing I learned about rattlesnakes is you don’t get in their head and try and figure out why they want to bite you, you don’t try and have a conversation with them, you don’t negotiate with them…you take their heads off with a .410 shotgun or a hoe before they bite you.” Sixteeners hail homeschooling in the Hawkeye State - Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., and Gov. Bobby Jindal, R-La., will take part in a discussion on homeschooling this afternoon in Des Moines, Iowa. Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar will join Gov. Huckabee earlier in the day to promote school choice and his conservative vision for education. [As the 2016 field converges on Iowa, the Des Moines Register is following their moves.] BLOOMBERG ADDS COAL TO HIS HIT LIST AP: “Billionaire Michael Bloomberg announced Wednesday that he is donating an additional $30 million to a Sierra Club initiative working to reduce the nation's use of coal. The Sierra Club has a goal of replacing half the nation's coal plants with renewable energy by 2017.” The Judge’s Ruling: Unneeded solution - With respect to Indiana’s original Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano observes, “If the Indiana legislature wanted to bring back the bad old days with respect to sexual orientation and public accommodations, one can understand the firestorm it got. If it was just trying to boast that it was defending the same religious liberties the Constitution already requires it to defend, its efforts were clumsy, unnecessary and wasteful.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE For many of the planets in our solar system we have the Greeks and Romans to thank for their names. For example, Jupiter is named after Zeus and its moons for his conquests. This holds true for nearly every planet in our solar system except for Uranus, whose names can be traced to the plays of Shakespeare. So how did the earth’s moon get such a seemingly generic name? Gizmodo explains: “The word ‘moon’ can be traced back to Old English, where it is said to have derived from the Proto-Germanic word ‘menon’, which in turn derived from the Proto-Indo-European ‘menses,’ meaning ‘month, moon.’ This highlights how far back the association between the Moon and the passage of time goes.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 45.6 percent//Disapprove – 49.9 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 30.5 percent//Wrong Track – 60.8 percent THE ROAD TO APPOMATTOX BEGAN WITH POLITICAL FAILURE The dictum that “war is the continuation of politics by other means” has never been so true as in the American Civil War. A political conflict over slavery sewn into the very soil from which the republic would grow proved too much for our system. After two generations of civic strife, war erupted in South Carolina on April 12, 1861. It would last until this date in 1865, with the surrender of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, Va. It was Palm Sunday in a tiny, dusty hamlet, unremarkable except for its railroad depot. Some 620,000 Americans had been killed in the previous four years. And it could fairly be said that their cause of death was political failure. That’s why the sesquicentennial of the end of the Civil War ought to be a somber moment for Americans today. We live with an increasingly failed political system and a society that shows deepening intolerance of the views of others. Public discourse of substance on any controversial topic is seemingly impossible. We are losing the tether. That’s not to say that we are on the brink of a new civil war, but it is undeniable that the path to national dissolution ran through hateful discourse and broken, insufficient politics. And that is to say nothing of the insult paid to those war dead by the individuals today who so roughly handle the institutions and culture that history show to be rare, precious and alarmingly fragile. Appomattox 101 - Lee’s army had been on the run since the beginning of the month after it had been forced from its lines at Petersburg, Va. The once-fearsome force, a shell of its former self, was moving west to Appomattox to obtain a stockpile of desperately needed weapons and ammunition. On April 7, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant wrote Lee prodding for surrender. “The results of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia,” Grant wrote. He added that any further effusion of blood would be Lee’s responsibility. Lee did not yield, but did seek to find what conditions Grant would offer. On Apr. 8, Lee had plotted one final route of escape. After initial successes on April 9, he found himself trapped. It was then Lee knew what he had to do. He telegraphed Grant seeking a meeting to discuss surrender. Fittingly, but quite by happenstance, officers chose the home of Wilmer McLean, who had moved from Northern Virginia early in the war to escape the fighting, for the parley. Grant, still wearing a mud-spattered uniform, proved to be gracious and generous in his terms of surrender. He permitted Confederate soldiers to keep their horses for the upcoming planting season. Officers were allowed to keep their side-arms and baggage. After receiving parole, the Army of Northern Virginia was allowed to return home without any stigma of treason. Grant also provided rations for Lee’s starving men. Upon returning to his troops Lee said, “Men, we have fought through the war together. I have done the best I could for you. My heart is too full to say more.” Syllabus - If today’s anniversary has you in the mood to dive deeper on the topic, here are ten of the finest books on the subject of the Civil War, compiled with some kind help from readers, via Twitter.

"NO SHAME IN HER GAME: HILLARY HANDS OUT JOURNALISM PRIZE Hillary Clinton presenting a journalism award is something like Scott Walker presenting the prize for the best AFSCME chapter. But neither she nor her hosts seemed the slightest bit embarrassed. They should have been. Having a Democratic frontrunner who is currently embroiled in a scandal involving her unprecedented efforts to conceal her activities as a cabinet official handing out the hardware and taking no questions should have been impossibly awkward. Instead, it provides a good indication of the level of scrutiny to which Clinton can expect to be subject in her campaign. She joked (or was it taunted?), “‘I am all about new beginnings: a new grandchild, another new hairstyle, a new email account.” Haw, haw. There are nearly unending questions, many of them fresh, about Clinton’s private server and her destruction of tens of thousands of emails from her time as secretary of state. Clinton is taking the final steps before the public launch of her second presidential campaign in the midst of stonewalling the press, but no one seemed to mind. [AP: “[President Obama] and [Hillary Clinton] met privately at the White House Monday afternoon…Moments after the White House confirmed the meeting, Clinton posted a message on Twitter praising Obama's health care law…”] Beat-sweeteners unite – Clinton talked about problems with her “relationship” with the news media, as if it were simply a misunderstanding or a matter of overcoming past mistrust. In the establishment media narrative, the question is whether the presumptive nominee will just “let her guard down” and let the people and the press see the “real her.” That’s just a bidding war among beat-sweetening reporters who are auditioning for access, implicitly promising to offer the perfect depiction of a strong-yet-nurturing-yet-funny-yet-thoughtful-yet-open-minded-yet-experienced candidate. It has nothing to do with the questions Clinton prefers to leave unanswered about her electronic antics or her buckraking from questionable sources around the globe. Nor does it address what she plans to do about the growing pressure for her to hand over her servers to a third party for review. Flattened out - Though Charlie Cook argues today that Clinton will continue to take blows from the press, Monday’s spectacle was probably a much better indication of the kind of kid-glove treatment Clinton will mostly receive. Clinton can count on the fact that mainstream coverage of her bid will be more like that given to a new product launch from an old institution than that which should be given to an actual candidate seeking the presidency. The danger for Clinton, though, is that the media mandarins who murmured and applauded their way through her remarks are increasingly being replaced by hungrier, younger reporters at new outlets. Clinton was not able to deal with the disruptions wrought by social media in her first presidential run. The world has changed dramatically in the past eight years, and she may not be ready to meet the challenge. Hillary never had an inspector general at State - Bloomberg: “One of the many unanswered questions of the Hillary Clinton e-mail story has been: Whose job was it to raise and address concerns about her exclusive use of a private account? According to open government advocates, it would have been the agency’s permanent, independent Inspector General—someone nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate—if such a person had existed. For five years, including all of Clinton’s time as secretary, the State Department’s Office of Inspector General never had a confirmed inspector.…By September 2013, several months after Clinton left State, the department finally had a permanent inspector, and the department recently released a report documenting how few e-mails the State Department has saved for government records.” Immigration activists back Warren’s symbolic non-candidacy - Buzzfeed: “Some of the activists who made immigration a difficult issue for President Obama in 2014 are now signing onto the effort to draft Sen. Elizabeth Warren, or some other Democrat, to challenge Hillary Clinton. …The latest participants: Arturo Carmona, executive director of Presente Action, which counts 300,000 members nationwide, and Erika Andiola, a national DREAMer activist, who played a key role in the fight for Obama’s executive actions on immigration.” O’Malley revs up core backers - WaPo: “Martin O’Malley’s leading supporters left an afternoon gathering in Baltimore on Monday more convinced than ever that he will move forward with a 2016 presidential bid, several participants in the event said. The former Maryland governor, who’s said he will probably make a decision by May, huddled with more than 150 donors and other boosters at the Baltimore Hilton for what was billed as an ‘issues conference.’” OBAMA CHIEF OF STAFF DENOUNCES ISRAEL’S ‘50-YEAR OCCUPATION’ OF PALESTINE NPR: “Through his chief of staff, President Obama is strongly countering rhetoric from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a two-state, Israeli-Palestinian solution. ’An occupation that has lasted for almost 50 years must end, and the Palestinian people must have the right to live in and govern themselves in their own sovereign state,’ Denis McDonough, President Obama's chief of staff, said Monday at the annual conference of J Street, a left-leaning pro-Israel group.” Bipartisan worries: 84 percent of House members sign letter warning Obama on Iran - The Hill: “A letter to President Obama signed by 367 members of Congress warns that lawmakers must be satisfied that any Iranian nuclear agreement must ‘foreclose any pathway to a bomb’ before they lift sanctions against Tehran. The letter, which was drafted in early March but released on Monday, warns Obama that ‘permanent sanctions relief from congressionally-mandated sanctions would require new legislation’ from Congress. ‘Congress must be convinced that its terms foreclose any pathway to a bomb, and only then will Congress be able to consider permanent sanctions relief,’ reads the letter, led by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) and ranking member Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.).” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... The New Criterion offers the remarkable story of the Kamuzu Academy in heart of Malawi, where the country’s former dictator Hastings Kamuzu Banda ordained that a preparatory school built on the Eton model would teach the classics of Greek and Latin literature. Banda is gone, as is the lavish funding that once made the school an opulent oasis. But the school remains, thanks to international funds and the patronage of local strongmen. British-educated Alexander Suebsaeng came to teach and discovered a bizarre world within a world, where American hip-hop clashes with Homer and Western weakness is overawed by Chinese electronics. It is a truly remarkable read. “Paradoxically, this evokes a powerful sense of changelessness: against what is constant, even and especially constant change, all human activity appears feeble, all ambition futile. ... In such a place, you grow accustomed to the bizarre and accept it as you accept the terrible and the wonderful.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, looked to transform his following among Tea Party conservatives into a broad mandate: “[I]n what aides signaled was a deliberate move by the principled yet tactical politician, Cruz used his address to emphasize the universality of his American experience, one that cuts across political, gender and class lines. The senator discussed his emotionally trying upbringing as the son of a Cuban refugee father and pioneering computer programmer mother — emphasizing how his Delaware-native mother advanced at work during a period when women were discouraged from pursuing careers.”","235","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/no-shame-in-her-game-hillary-hands-out-journalism-prize.html"
"Paul hits Cruz on ‘winability’ - “Right now, I’m the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states. There will be a lot of conservatives.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., on “The Kelly File.” Watch here. Right face - WaPo takes a detailed look at how, with Cruz in, the race for the GOP right is heating up: “[A]t least a half-dozen credible contenders are likely to join Cruz in competing for the hearts of conservatives. They face a labyrinth of tests of ideology and temperament, on talk radio and at tea party and faith forums, in a melee to become the hard right’s standard-bearer.” Hillary’s camp: Cruz is good news - “Those closest to the former secretary of state have counseled patience, arguing that a core element of Clinton’s plan was to get out of the way and let the dueling wings of the Republican Party savage each other while she floats above it all, Politico reports. Cruz, they say, is Hillary’s wrecking ball.” Cruz tipped Rubio - Politico: “Sen. Ted Cruz surprised many political observers by becoming the first official presidential candidate for 2016 on Monday. But not Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio (R-Fla.) said he got a heads-up from his conservative colleague last week that the announcement was forthcoming, and Rubio praised Cruz (R-Texas) several times during a lengthy gaggle with Capitol Hill reporters on Monday afternoon.” Trump trolls Cruz on nativity - “Ted has just one extra level of complication… He was a Canadian and American citizen a couple of years ago. So it’s one extra level of complication that other people frankly don’t have….I hope he’s going to be Okay…but it is one extra level that he has to worry about. – Donald Trump, on “The Kelly File.” Watch here.

The invitation asks for donations or for attendees to raise up to $100,000 per couple.

"BIG WIN FOR WALKER AT SUPREME COURT WaPo: “The Supreme Court on Monday turned down a challenge to Wisconsin’s voter ID law, which it had previously kept from going into effect before November's elections. The court's decision not to review a federal appeals court ruling that upheld the law was a victory for Gov. Scott Walker (R) and perhaps other states that have tightened voting procedures to require additional identification. More challenges to specific state laws are in the pipeline.” COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE, 2.0: KASICH HITS THE TRAIL Cincinnati Enquirer: “Ohio Gov. John Kasich is testing his potential presidential message in earnest this week, starting with a campaign trip in New Hampshire [today]. Will the trip springboard Kasich to the top of a crowded, but far from closed, GOP presidential field? Or will his presidential campaign fizzle before it kicks off? Here’s what to watch Tuesday: What is Kasich’s bedside manner as a ‘retail politicker’? …Are these Kasich’s voters? …Will he make news, the kind of news he wants to make? …Headlines often come from the most interesting thing a candidate says. Given Kasich’s potential to give a frank, free-wheeling speech, possibilities abound. Kasich will ride the momentum of his New Hampshire visit [today], positive or negative, to New York City, where he’ll give a speech Wednesday night to economists and political elite. Thursday he travels to Maine, for another balanced-budget amendment pitch.” [Kasich’s stops will include the Politics & Eggs breakfast, followed by a question and answer session with the Nashua Chamber of Commerce and finally a stop at Politics & Pie.] Social justice candidate - Yahoo’s Andrew Romano takes an in-depth look at Kasich’s effort to meld the social-justice doctrine of his faith with Republicanism:","237","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/no-shame-in-her-game-hillary-hands-out-journalism-prize.html"

George W. Bush emerged as a force in Republican politics. Kasich remembers the challenge well. ‘First of all I was a congressman, nobody knew who I was,’ he said. ‘Secondly, I didn't have a big financial base.’ Third, ‘I knew the handwriting was on the wall’ pointing to Bush winning.” [Watch Fox: Campaign Carl Cameron is back on the trail bringing the latest from Kasich in the Granite State.] CAMPAIGN DAYBOOK * Former Sen.

"“My ideal Republican ticket for 2016 is John Kasich for president & Marco Rubio for vice-president. Both are well qualified & are from states the Republicans need to win the White House.” – Douglas Sorenson","240","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/no-shame-in-her-game-hillary-hands-out-journalism-prize.html"
"“Marco Rubio has a history of getting things done by working across the aisle. He’s bright, articulate, and has a personal immigration story that gives him personal experience and gravitas from which to speak. He could be a very attractive Republican uniter, if he can hold his own in the shake-out process.” – John E Sutton “While I like Ted Cruz, I believe he’s too far to the right to attract the Independent voting block come the general election. My take is a Scott Walker/Carly Fiorina ticket would be the perfect GOP foil to Hillary’s campaign. Carly could assail Hillary’s record without the claims of sexism, and you know that’s coming, and Walker has proven you can take on the union and still win three elections.” – Dave Lutter NEIGHBORS RELIEVED BY BURGLARY Reuters: “British police said on Monday they were hunting for thieves who broke into an apartment in northwest England and stole 38 Royal Python snakes. The non-venomous snakes, which included eight pregnant females, were taken from a house in St Helens last week, police added. Two men were spotted leaving the scene carrying two sacks. ‘This is a large collection of snakes that the victim had been gathering for a while,’ said Det. Con. Neil Henry of Merseyside Police.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “We already tried a first term senator…[Sen. Ted Cruz] talks about you have to walk the walk, rather than talk the talk, you have to have done something, but that’s not his record in the Senate…but when [Gov. Scott Walker] says I ran the state, I took on the unions, I took on the liberals and I won. It’s going to be a strong argument” –Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"Buzz Cut: • Ugly early: Paul’s entry sets off first round of attacks • Jeb biding his time • Ex-intel boss says ‘very high’ likelihood Hillary’s server hacked • Schumer fights Obama on Iran plan • An old-fashioned broil-meets-grill story","278","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/07/ugly-early-pauls-entry-sets-off-first-round-attacks.html"
"UGLY EARLY: PAUL’S ENTRY SETS OFF FIRST ROUND OF ATTACKS There is a whole subculture in the Republican establishment devoted to hating Rand Paul, and this is the day its adherents have been waiting for. As Paul gets ready to kick off his official campaign in Louisville today, the effort to kill it intensifies. Paul has moderated his stances, recently calling for a 16 percent raise in Pentagon spending, but that has done nothing to cool the antipathy from the most hawkish members of his party who deem Paul an isolationist. When presidential hopeful Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., suggested Sunday that presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton might be preferable to Paul, he was speaking aloud what many in the GOP establishment have long said in private. It’s a sign of Paul’s clout that he would be taken so seriously despite consistently trailing the frontrunners. But if he allows his foes to define him as the peacenik Republican, Paul is done for. [“They felt the same way about [Jon Huntsman].” – an unidentified Republican operative talking to Eliana Johnson about resentment within the party about favorable establishment media coverage for Rand Paul.] Nuclear option - How serious is the GOP establishment about smothering Paul’s bid? The Foundation for a Security and Prosperous America, a new outside group led by GOP insider Rick Reed is dumping $1 million on an ad campaign slamming Paul for past statements about Iran. The 30-second ad, scheduled to begin Wednesday in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, accuses Paul of supporting negotiations with Iran and not supporting sanctions against the Islamic regime. The Kentucky senator is heard on the ad saying, “You know, it’s ridiculous to think, they are a threat to our national security.” A narrator concludes the ad stating, “Tell Rand Paul to stop siding with [President Obama], because even one Iranian bomb would be a disaster.” [In keeping with his ant-Washington message, Paul has dropped “Senator” from his Twitter handle simply opting for @randpaul while identifying himself as “Dr. Paul.”] Unappetizing appetizer - The anti-Paul spot is just the start of what promises to be the single-nastiest Republican nominating process in memory. Paul will doubtless be responding to the swipe with his own large and well-funded campaign network. Similar attacks, funded by the ever growing universe of independent groups and super PACs, will be good news only for Clinton (and the consultants and media buyers who are producing them). While 2012 saw plenty of toxic dumping, the size of the field, the depth of the resources and the proliferation of outside groups means that long before the candidates hit the debate stage in August, they – or their supporters – will have been besmirching each other for months. [The other Dr. Paul - Bloomberg:“Former Texas Representative Ron Paul will attend Tuesday’s expected launch of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul's presidential bid.”] Tight, tight, tight - A new national poll by New Jersey’s Monmouth University found the 2016 Republican field wide open. Poll results, released Tuesday, put former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the lead with 13 percent, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, both at 11 percent. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee drew 9 percent, Ben Carson and Donald Trump were at 7 percent. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul polled at 6 percent. The poll found a three-way tie between New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at 5 percent. [Arizona Republic: “Veteran U.S. Sen. John McCain will announce [today] that he will seek a sixth term in 2016. McCain, R-Ariz., plans to officially declare his bid for re-election during a speech before the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry at the Arizona Biltmore resort in central Phoenix.] JEB BIDING HIS TIME David Drucker got a look at Jeb Bush’s schedule for the weeks to come and concluded that the establishment frontrunner won’t be making his candidacy official for some time: “As competitors for the Republican presidential nomination accelerate their campaigns, the former two-term Florida governor appears content to slow-walk toward an expected 2016 bid. … Bush remains focused on raising money for his political action committee and super PAC, both called Right to Rise. The Floridian is scheduled through at least May 25 to headline several fundraisers for these two organizations, created late last year as a precursor to Bush's running for president. … According to a list of events obtained by the Washington Examiner, upcoming Bush events are set for: Chicago (twice); Boston; Nashville; Vero Beach, Fla.; an unnamed city in Ohio; Portland, Ore; New York (twice); Seattle and Puerto Rico.” [Bush heads to Colorado today for a breakfast with veterans in Colorado Springs and later to Denver for an “energy event.”] CHRISTIE READIES N.H. CAMPAIGN SWING AP: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is taking his signature town hall events on the road. The potential Republican presidential contender will be kicking off what his team has dubbed a ‘Tell it like it is’ town hall tour in Londonderry, New Hampshire on April 15. A spokeswoman for his political action committee says a second town hall will he held on April 17. He’ll also hold events in Manchester and Newmarket and speak at a New Hampshire GOP-organized summit in Nashua. The trip will be Christie’s first extended swing through the early voting state that is seen a place where his blunt style could play well with voters.”","279","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/07/ugly-early-pauls-entry-sets-off-first-round-attacks.html"
"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE For physicians monitoring how cancer patients react to chemotherapy, the process of arriving at a prognosis is often tedious, costly and invasive. Science Daily looks at how sound-waves are providing an easier and more affordable way to examine cancerous cells. “Acoustic-based separations are potentially important because they are non-invasive and do not alter or damage cells… If two sound sources are placed opposite each other and each emits the same wavelength of sound, there will be a location where the opposing sounds cancel each other. Because sound waves have pressure, they can push very small objects, so a cell or nanoparticle will move with the sound wave until it reaches the location where there is no longer lateral movement, in this case, into the fluid stream that moves the separated cells along.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Appearing on “The Kelly File” Monday Michael Flynn told host Megyn Kelly said the likelihood was “very high” that Clinton’s server may have been hacked by “China, Russia, Iran, potentially the North Koreans and other countries who may be quote/unquote our allies.” Watch the full interview here Hillary’s $2 billion plan to ‘connect with real people’ - Fox News: “After what aides expect to be an initial announcement on social media, [Hillary Clinton] reportedly will do some relatively small campaign events in key early states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton’s approach in 2016 will illustrate that as a presidential candidate ‘she fights for every vote and takes nothing for granted,’ a Democratic official said. … The 2016 plan is to have Clinton try to ‘connect with real people’ better than she did eight years ago, according to a Democratic official with knowledge of the announcement plans and strategy.” Biden to court deep pocketed gay donors - Bloomberg: “On April 30th, some of the biggest [gay rights] philanthropists… will gather in Dallas for ‘OutGiving,’ an annual conference organized by Tim Gill, the founder of Quark and an important behind-the-scenes figure in the gay rights movement, who over the last decade has worked to organize the political strategy for a large group of wealthy gay donors…On May 2, Biden will be a keynote speaker (per the Vice President's office, reporters will have an opportunity to cover his remarks).” SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX “I have voted Republican my whole life, but find Rand Paul to be quite refreshing with his positions. The fact that he has Libertarian views makes for an excellent balance for those of us who want government to stay out of our way and be greatly reduced…Very tired of the press painting him as if he would not defend the U.S. if need be. He is one of the most thoughtful and balanced Statesman. He will be a force to be reckoned with in the debates, because he thinks beyond talking points. Rand Paul is not a polarizing figure. He appeals to people across both parties, as well as independents.” –Barbara Hayes “I am hoping the ranking in the field will change with the formal announcements of Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, and long-shot announcement John Bolton for the GOP nomination. I am a Graham supporter, and think he would be a good wartime president…I do think we will be involved in one or more wars, especially against ISIS… Graham is my first choice among likely contenders. Marco Rubio would be my second, and John Bolton, although a very long shot, would be my third.”­­—Jim Gau, Hancock, Mich. “Scott Walker has been high on my radar for quite a while; however the more I hear about Ted Cruz, the more I feel he is the one to carry the torch for conservative Republicans.” – Jean Witte, Santa Claus, Ind. SCHUMER FIGHTS OBAMA ON IRAN PLAN The Hill: “New York Sen. Charles Schumer, the next in line to become Senate Democratic leader, is demanding that Congress review and approve any nuclear deal struck with Iran. Schumer, who will replace Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) at the end of next year, says President Obama must submit the deal to Congress despite the administration’s reluctance to do so. ‘This is a very serious issue that deserves careful consideration and I expect to have a classified briefing in the near future. I strongly believe Congress should have the right to disapprove any agreement and I support the [Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.,] bill which would allow that to occur,’ he said in a statement.” Obama says deal only delays Iran nuke - Fox News: “President Obama admitted Tuesday…that his nuclear agreement with Iran only delays Tehran from eventually acquiring a weapon, which could come immediately after Year 13 of the agreement…in an interview with NPR News…” But… - Obama’s timeframe seemed to contradict a press briefing from Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, tapped by the president to sell the deal. Moniz called the tentative nuclear deal with Tehran a “forever agreement” that would block all pathways to a nuclear weapon and set up tough international inspections with no end date. Obama: It’s a good deal, no matter what - “I would argue that this deal is the right thing to do for the United States, for our allies in the region and for world peace regardless of the nature of the Iranian regime….[T]his is a good deal if you think Iran’s open to change. It’s also a good deal if you think that Iran is implacably opposed to the United States and the West and our values.” – President Obama in an interview with NPR. STEYER TO TRY AGAIN IN 2016 The Hill: “Billionaire liberal activist Tom Steyer hopes to shame GOP presidential candidates over their climate change skepticism in the 2016 campaign. He is also seeking to tie Republicans to his arch foes: Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who spent more than $100 million in the 2014 midterms behind GOP candidates opposed to environmental regulations…The initial effort, launched Monday with a video, is being dubbed the ‘Hot Seat.’ It’s the first NextGen campaign to feature its dual priorities of highlighting GOP candidates’ climate skepticism and their links to the Kochs.” DECISION DAY: RAHM’S RUNOFF Chicago voters head to the polls today as Chicago’s Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel is expected to turn back a challenge from Cook County Commissioner Jesus “Chuy” Garcia. The Atlantic examines why the left is having a difficult time toppling President Obama’s former chief of staff. AN OLD-FASHIONED BROIL-MEETS-GRILL STORY An Illinois couple has gone from being the butt of viral jokes to having their special day paid for. Joel Burger and Ashley King are set to get married July 17. The pair has been known as “Burger-King” since elementary school. Accordingly, when they announced their engagement earlier this spring it was with a picture taken next to the BK restaurant logo in Springfield. After some help from the local paper, the couple was put in touch with the King himself. During a Skype call Monday, the two were informed the fast food chain planned to pick up the full tab for their nuptials this summer. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “The situation has changed. The fruits of [President Obama’s] isolationism are now being shown experienced. The beheading of Americans, the collapse of Yemen, giving away everything on the deal with Iran. The country is seeing that that kind of retreat yields really terrible results and I think the problem that [Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.] has is that his association with this non-interventionism is now a problem and he has to tack back, which again undermines his other strength which is his authenticity.” –Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"HILLARY’S LAUNCH DATE: WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? The cover of this week’s edition of The Economist asks “What does Hillary stand for?” If you don’t know by now, folks, you haven’t been paying attention. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton stands for winning, whatever the cost. She has paid dearly over the past 40 years, and is now closer than ever to the ultimate goal. But if she is to be undone – yet again – in her quest for power it will be her desire itself that does her in. There is an ocean’s worth of leaks pointing to this weekend as when the former first lady will make her candidacy a formal, legal fact. Saturday or Sunday? Twitter or Youtube? Iowa first or someplace else? Bubba or Baby Charlotte? The correct answer to these questions is: Whatevs. The only question that would have been helpful to Clinton – Will she or won’t she? – was never seriously in consideration. And in that, she has had a damaging failure. [Whoo-hoo! “We just wanted to get this thing over with and get on with it.” – a Clinton campaign aide talking to Politico.] The presidency is like a bank loan or a first date: It’s much harder to get if it seems like you really need it. And compared to Clinton’s decades-long pursuit of power, Mitt Romney looks like a slacker. From the day she left the White House in 2001, she has been trying to get back in. But Clinton missed a chance over the past year to give Americans cause to think she might not really run. One could argue that the fault is not her own, since she has been forced to alter her schedule and modify her message in order to quell concerns from Democrats and deal directly with double-duty scandals. The time in which it would have been helpful for the former secretary of state to have been seen as actually undecided about running was consumed in recovering first from a dreadful book launch and then the stories of her family foundation’s sketchy dealings and then, worst of all, the secret servers. [A tangled web - WashEx combs through several potential conflicts of interest surrounding Clinton to produce a very impressive and useful interactive graphic.] But the fault ultimately lies with the candidate. The problem with the book launch was Clinton’s refusal to back down about being “dead broke” and the double-barreled scandals were the consequences of her own ethical lapses. But let’s be plain: The real reason Hillary couldn’t appear to be in doubt another run is that we have come to know her too well over the years. It’s true that Americans instinctively mistrust anyone too hungry for power, but it’s not like Clinton could just reinvent herself (though not for lack of trying). Instead, Clinton’s efforts to appear undecided sounded parodic. [“Any day now, Hillary Clinton is expected to declare that she is running for president. For most Americans this will be as surprising as the news that Cinco de Mayo will once again be on May 5th.”–The Economist.] Power Play: Likable enough? - Roll Call Editor in Chief Christina Bellantoni and Philip Klein, Managing Editor of the Washington Examiner, join Chris Stirewalt to share their views. WATCH HERE RNC launches Stop Hillary campaign - Hoping voters will slam the brakes on Hillary Clinton, the Republican National Committee released an ad today titled “Stop Hillary.” The video shows a silhouetted Hillary figure walking out on stage to a podium with voiceover snippets including, “Hillary Clinton has some explaining to do.” “Used her personal email account to conduct official business” “Wanted to reset relations with Russia.” “Not really working out well” “Potentially catastrophic move for Hillary Clinton” “Taking millions of dollars from foreign governments” “Sniper fire, it was a total crock, it was a lie,” and Clinton’s own: “What difference at this point does it make” “This is just par for the course for the Clintons, they’re always a bit secretive,” the ad concludes. Going whole quahog: Chaffee hammers Hillary - WaPo: “Lincoln Chafee, a former U.S. senator and governor from Rhode Island, announced Thursday that he is exploring a run for the Democratic presidential nomination. And unlike other potential Clinton challengers, Chafee appears to be spoiling for a fight. …Chafee did not mince words when he said Clinton's 2002 Senate vote to authorize military action in Iraq should disqualify her from becoming commander in chief. ‘I don't think anybody should be president of the United States that made that mistake,’ Chafee said. ‘It's a huge mistake and we live with broad, broad ramifications today — of instability not only in the Middle East but far beyond and the loss of American credibility. There were no weapons of mass destruction.’ Chafee, who was a Republican at the time, was the only senator from his party to vote against the Iraq war authorization.” Dueling Dems - Former Gov. Martin O’Malley, D-Md., and former Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., will both take the stage at the Polk County Democrats' Spring Dinner this evening in Iowa. Webb continues in Iowa this weekend with a series of events Saturday and a fundraiser Sunday. O’Malley travels to New York City, Saturday to address Al Sharpton’s National Action Network. Wounded pride - Former President Bill Clinton is pushing back on a NYT report that described him thusly: “…his hearing has faded. With his head of white hair and frail frame, he looks older than his 68 years.” An attendee of a recent private fundraiser for the Clinton Foundation delivered the talking points to Politico, in which Bubba called the piece “creative writing.” The NYT report says that while Hillary insiders will grant the former president considerable access, a senior aide will serve as his minder.

Thus far, tunnel excavation has yielded a section of a medieval barge, a Bronze Age wooden walkway and the remains of a Mesolithic campfire. New Yorker contributor Sam Knight describes the fascinating and spooky layers of history being unearthed at the dig’s largest site, the Bedlam burial ground. Archeologists are literally working the graveyard shift on the acre of land in the heart of the financial district as they unearth thousands of bodies. The dig contains victims of the bubonic plague of 1655, a volcanic eruption in 1258 and the remains of a Roman cemetery that contained 5,000 skeletons. “There is a lot of death here in Liverpool Street,” Jay Carver, Crossrail’s lead archeologist, said “It is a reservoir of information.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The letter is an objection to a million-dollar ad buy by a group called the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, led by Republican operative Rick Reed.

Rand Paul [R-Ky.] pushed back Thursday [in South Carolina] at hawkish critics who have slammed his more cautious foreign policy posture: War, he said, is not a ‘game, and should not be used for political advantage.’ ‘I will never take the country to war without just cause and without congressional approval,""’ Paul said ... as the U.S.S.

Dissension in the Dem ranks - Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel examines how the recent swipes Democrats have taken at each other could be sign of further friction in the blue team’s ranks. WHO NEEDS A PAC? STRICKLAND’S GOT A PENSION National Journal: “If Ted Strickland wins a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2016, he would, at age 75, be the oldest freshman ever elected to the chamber by popular vote. The Ohio Democrat would also arrive in Washington with something else unusual for a freshman senator: He’s already collecting a congressional pension. The pension is a benefit accrued during two separate stints in the U.S. House of Representatives… If elected, Strickland would apparently not be able to simultaneously draw both a $174,000 Senate salary and his House pension, according to federal retirement rules. Presumably, he would collect the larger salary. ‘Although the congressional retirement checks stop coming when an ex-lawmaker reenters the House or Senate, the benefits will only be sweeter when he or she retires again,’ noted Pete Sepp, president of the National Taxpayers Union, which tracks congressional pensions.” THE NEXT ONE CAN SAY ‘CLOSE ENOUGH FOR GOVERNMENT WORK’ Time: “The U.S. Postal Service said … it would not reissue a recently released Maya Angelou memorial stamp that prominently features a quote from another author. USPS spokesman David Partenheimer told the New York Times that the quote — “A bird doesn’t sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song” — was often cited by the late poet during interviews, but it was written by Joan Walsh Anglund in 1967. (Angelou never took credit for the quotation.) “The sentence held great meaning for her, and she is publicly identified with its popularity,” Partenheimer told the Times. … This is not the first such mistake. President Obama falsely attributed the sentence to Angelou during the presentation of the 2013 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal. The stamp was released on Tuesday during an event in Washington D.C. that included First Lady Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey…” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “One of the great advantages the GOP has running against Hillary is Clinton fatigue.

"OBAMA BID TO BEAT BIBI BACKFIRES American liberals, presumably including those at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., just two days ago were fantasizing about a world that didn’t include Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister of Israel, or at least a Bibi in a substantially weakened fashion. The imaginings included Israel blessing a nuclear deal with Iran and the eventual establishment of a full Palestinian state. Netanyahu’s defeat was considered a done deal and counted as a double blessing because not only would his defeat put the liberal party in control in Israel, but also be an embarrassment for the Likud-loving Republicans at home who had just hosted the prime minister for a joint meeting of Congress. But today, a hard reality has fallen as Netanyahu not only won re-election, but did so handily. He faces a newly unified opposition and the rising clout of Arab groups, but Bibi is back and he’s been vindicated. And as they consider the comeback, American liberals would do well to consider the part President Obama played. While the question of U.S. taxpayer funds going to defeat Netanyahu and Likud remains in question, it is no secret that Obama has disdain for Netanyahu and was working publicly to undermine his position ahead of the election. And it turned out to be very helpful… for Netanyahu. Obama is not popular in Israel and foreign interference in elections is even less popular. Obama’s overt and covert actions to damage Netanyahu and install the liberal party gave Netanyahu and his party the perfect opportunity to warn of foreign meddling and tell his base voters to rally in order to defy Obama. As polls showed Netanyahu trailing, he moved right and fired up his base by agreeing with more hawkish factions to drop the pursuit of a “two-state solution.” So for Obama’s effort to undercut Netanyahu, Obama got Netanyahu not only returned to power, but with a rightward shift. Rubio ‘absolutely’ willing to undo Iran nuke deal - AP: “Eying the Republican presidential nomination, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Tuesday he would ‘absolutely’ defy stalwart European allies if necessary to revoke any Iranian nuclear deal he might inherit from President Barack Obama. In an interview with The Associated Press, Rubio said the next U.S. president ‘should not be bound’ by a potential Obama administration agreement, even if European negotiating partners stand behind the deal. ‘The United States, although it's less than ideal, could unilaterally re-impose more crushing and additional sanctions,’ Rubio said. He said he would also ‘use the standing of the United States on the global stage to try to encourage other nations to do so.’…Rubio said the only possible deal he could accept is one that would fully disband Iran's enrichment capacity. The agreement taking shape would limit Iran's uranium enrichment and other nuclear activity for at least a decade, but slowly lift the restrictions over several years.” BOEHNER: HAND OVER THE SERVER, HILLARY House Speaker John Boehner added his voice to a chorus of Republicans pressing Hillary Clinton to turn over her private email server to an independent arbiter, saying the “American people deserve the facts.” “That’s the fairest way to make sure that we have all the documents that belong to the public,” Boehner told reporters in his first public remarks since Clinton revealed that as secretary of state she kept her emails on a separate “home” server. Boehner declared that a review by a “neutral third party” is the only way to determine if congressional investigators probing the 2012 attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, have what they need. While the chairman of the Benghazi panel and other lawmakers have called for a third party investigation, Clinton has said the server “will remain private.” [The Kelly File - Former Assistant Attorney General Shannen Coffin explored potential evidence in the email scandal that would raise questions about whether Hillary Clinton committed a crime. Watch here.] State Department: No record of Clinton signing ‘separation’ form - Fox News: “The State Department said Tuesday it has no record of Hillary Clinton signing a key form stating she turned over all official documents upon leaving the department, a form that was the subject of intense speculation since the issue could determine whether she broke the law….State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters they are ‘fairly certain she did not’ sign it. ‘We have reviewed Secretary Clinton’s official personnel file and administrative files and do not have any record of her signing the OF109 [form],’ Psaki said…Psaki claimed Clinton did not violate any policy.” [Nothing to see here - AP: “For the second consecutive year, the Obama administration more often than ever censored government files or outright denied access to them under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.”] Staffing up – Team Hillary has added Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon as lead press secretary and Clay Middleton, a grassroots organizer, who will serve as South Carolina state director and oversee the first-in-the-South primary campaign. An active supporter during her 2008 run, former governor Richard W. Riley has also taken a behind-the-scenes leadership role in the South Carolina campaign. Granite State Dems urge Warren bid - “Run Warren Run” which would like to see her challenge Hillary Clinton, is touting a public letter signed by 27 current and former members of New Hampshire’s House of Representatives and State Senate urging Senator Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2016. The signatories of the letter, released today, include 23 current legislators – about 10 percent of the Democrats in the statehouse. From the text: “We need leaders who aren’t afraid to tell the truth, and fight back—no matter what powerful interests say—and we need all the candidates in the primary to offer a bold vision for an economy that works for all Americans…. Sen. Warren is a fighter for middle class and working families who has stood up to the corporate interests and Wall Street banks. We urge Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2016.” POWER PLAY: RACE KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. Why are candidates spending so much time and in key primary states in 2015? Chris Stirewalt explains, in 60 seconds, how changes in the process have compressed the GOP presidential election calendar. WATCH HERE. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Do you know the story of Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum? It is home to an astonishing private collection that includes amazing pieces from the Northern Renaissance and impressionists. But the museum is more famous for being the scene of an audacious art heist in 1990 that was worthy of “The Thomas Crown Affair” and remains unsolved to this day. Why would someone steal paintings so famous they couldn’t ever be displayed after the theft? Boston Globe reporter Stephen Kurkjian has spent decades on the question and has just produced a new book on the subject. The reporter believes that the story of the robbery is more akin to “The Departed,” and was the work of Boston’s Irish gangsters ignorant of the art world. Kurkjian spoke with NPR about his theory of the case and his interview with the self-described “hippie” night watchman who was more worried about missing a Grateful Dead show than protecting the collection. Was it goons who didn’t know what they were stealing or were they paid by a mystery figure to pull off the job? The investigation remains open. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

To win, Jeb needs the backing of evangelical Christians to prevent social and economic conservatives from teaming up to block the establishment favorite’s path to the Republican nomination. While both brothers are devout, George is an evangelical Protestant while Jeb is an adult convert to an orthodox form of Roman Catholicism. But the Protestant base of the GOP is warming to Catholics and Catholics are warming to the GOP, so the chances that America’s second Catholic president will be a Republican grow stronger all the time. But how does a candidate broach the sensitive subject of his or her personal faith without seeming to be exploiting? The GOP frontrunner gets a boost in that today from the NYT, which visited Jeb at mass and explores his Christian walk. [“I loved the absolute nature of the Catholic Church. It resonated with me.” – Jeb Bush in answer to a NYT question as to why he left the Episcopalian faith of his upbringing.] NYT: “[A] bit of a murmur, and the occasional ‘Morning, Governor,’ passed through the Spanish Renaissance-style church, with its manicured grounds and towering palms, as worshipers recognized their most famous neighbor, Jeb Bush. He held hands with the other worshipers during the Lord’s Prayer, sang along to ‘I Am the Bread of Life,’ and knelt after receiving Communion… ‘It gives me a serenity, and allows me to think clearer,’ Mr. Bush said as he exited the tile-roof church here on a recent Sunday, exchanging greetings and, with the ease of a longtime politician, acquiescing to the occasional photo. ‘It’s made me a better person.’ “Many of his priorities during his two terms as governor of Florida aligned with those of the Catholic Church…He differed from his church, significantly and openly, over capital punishment; 21 prisoners were executed by the state on his watch, the most under any Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. But he has also won praise from Catholic officials for his welcoming tone toward immigrants, and his relatively centrist positions on education…” Jeb says states should set minimum wages - The Hill: “Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Tuesday the federal government should not be involved in raising the minimum wage during a campaign stop in South Carolina. ‘We need to leave it to the private sector,’ he said when asked whether raising the minimum wage is a good idea, according to video from the event on YouTube. ‘I think state minimum wages are fine; the federal government shouldn’t be doing this.’…Bush argued the calls for raising the minimum wage are driven by positive poll numbers, but that doing so only looks good on the surface. He added that workers in lower-paying jobs could benefit in the short term from a raise in pay, but that businesses would eventually change practices to cut costs and ultimately fire those employees.” Spring break - Jeb continues his southern swing today with a breakfast speech in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Mom says Jeb’s the best - Former first lady Barbara Bush is out with a new fundraising pitch today for her son. Fox News: “An email message from her -- titled ‘I changed my mind!’ -- will officially kick off the ‘Run Jeb Run’ fund…[aimed at] supporters of the Right to Rise super PAC supporting the Republican ex-governor. In it, the former first lady says her son is ‘our best chance of taking back the White House in 2016’….Barbara Bush made headlines in 2013 amid growing speculation Jeb Bush might run for the presidency when she said, ‘there are other people out there that are very qualified and we’ve had enough Bushes.’” WALKER DIGITAL DIRECTOR LEAVES AFTER TWEET TORTURE AP: “An aide to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s national political operation resigned late Tuesday after drawing heated criticism from the head of the Iowa Republican Party for questioning the state's early role in the presidential nominating process. Veteran Republican strategist Liz Mair told The Associated Press that she was leaving Walker's team just a day after she had been tapped to lead his online communication efforts, citing the distraction created by a series of recent Twitter posts about Iowa’s presidential caucuses. ‘The tone of some of my tweets concerning Iowa was at odds with that which Gov. Walker has always encouraged in political discourse,’ Mair said in a statement announcing her immediate resignation. ‘I wish Gov. Walker and his team all the best.’” BRACKET BUSTER: RAND PLANS POST-TOURNEY DEBUT Lexington (Ky.) Herald Leader: “U.S. Sen. Rand Paul isn’t waiting for the Kentucky Derby to shoot out of the starting gate. Next month, the day after the NCAA championship game, Paul plans to announce that he is running for president in front of hundreds of supporters at Louisville’s Galt House. While Paul’s team emphasized that the senator might still decide against running for president, they confirmed the planned April 7 launch date, which was originally reported by the New York Times, and said invitations to the event have already been sent to supporters and Republican officials…Following the announcement, Paul will leave Louisville to embark on a nearly week-long trip to the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, with fundraising stops and grassroots rallies in a handful of other states along the way…” [The Louisville Courier-Journal reports that Rand is now writing two books this year in addition to likely running in two races in 2016.

A senior adviser tells the New Hampshire Union Leader that Trump will not be renewing his contract with NBC for the reality television ‘Apprentice’ series. Combined with staff hires, Trump’s announcement that he will form an exploratory committee for the first time is a sign the billionaire is seriously considering running for the Republican nomination.” DISAFFECTED GOP ELITES SEEK MORE ACCESS FOR INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES IN DEBATES WaPo: “The group, called Change the Rule, recently wrote a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan organization that runs general-election debates, urging it to eliminate the rule requiring non-major-party candidates to average at least 15 percent in public polling to participate. … The effort is being financed by Peter Ackerman, a managing director of investment firm Rockport Capital, who founded Americans Elect, an advocacy group that tried unsuccessfully to create a national online presidential primary in 2012. …[Signatories] include former directors of national intelligence Dennis C.

SENATE RACE AFTER SCHULTZ, CRIST STEP ASIDE Miami Herald: “There will be no Debbie Wasserman Schultz for Senate campaign, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman said Tuesday. She will instead seek reelection to her South Florida congressional seat in 2016. ‘I will be running for reelection in the United States House of Representatives and serving my full, four-year term that President Obama has asked me to serve as chair of the DNC,’ she told CNN…Her announcement comes the day after former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist also said he, too, won’t run for Senate. The two decisions pave the way for U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of Jupiter to launch his campaign. He’s expected to do so next week. U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, a Democrat from Orlando said Tuesday it’s more likely he’ll run now that Wasserman Schultz won’t.” SPECIAL ELECTION TO REPLACE SCHOCK WILL BE HELD BY JULY Peoria Journal Star: “[A] special election to fill the seat U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock is vacating is to be held no later than July, according to state law. Schock’s resignation is effective March 31. Within five days after that, Gov. Bruce Rauner is to set a date for the special election, according to Steve Sandvoss, executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections. The election is to be held within 115 days of the date Rauner’s office issues its notice to the clerks of the 19 counties in the 18th District, Sandvoss said. That notice is to include a date for a primary election. Nothing in state law mandates a date for the primary, nor does the election have to be on a Tuesday, Sandvoss said.” Schock-waves of interest - Champaign-Urbana (Ill.) News-Gazette: “State Sen. Jason Barickman, R-Bloomington, said he is interested in succeeding U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Peoria, who abruptly resigned Tuesday from his 18th Congressional District seat. State Rep. Dan Brady, R-Bloomington, also said this afternoon that he’s ‘looking at’ the seat. And a spokesman for state Sen. Bill Brady, R-Bloomington, said the former Republican gubernatorial candidate also is considering running for the west central Illinois congressional seat. Also mentioned as potential Republican candidates in the overwhelmingly Republican district are state Sen. Darin LaHood of Dunlap and former state Rep. Jil Tracy of Quincy.” POLITICS AT PLAY IN SENATE BUDGET PLAN Bloomberg: “Senate Republicans will unveil their version of a U.S. government spending plan Wednesday that will diverge from their House counterparts’ proposal. The House put forth a plan Tuesday that would curtail government spending and balance the budget in nine years by partially privatizing Medicare and by making deep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. The proposal would cut $5.5 trillion in spending over that period. The Senate will avoid the House’s plan on Medicare, according to a Senate aide familiar with the plan. With the federal deficit easing and entitlement cuts unpopular with voters, Republicans worry that such an approach would damage them politically in 2016. In the Senate, where 24 of the 54 Republican seats are up for re-election, party leaders want to spare members from casting difficult votes on proposals that have no chance of becoming law while President Barack Obama is in office.”","453","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/18/obama-bid-to-beat-bibi-backfires.html"
"[President Obama is expected to renew his criticism of the Republican budget plan in an appearance in Cleveland today] DEMOCRATS BLOCK HUMAN TRAFFICKING BILL WashEx: “Senate Democrats blocked a once-bipartisan human trafficking bill over abortion language they said they failed to notice when they sponsored the legislation. The vote was 55-43, falling seven votes shy of the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster. The vote creates uncertainty not only for the legislation but for the Senate calendar. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said a planned vote this week on the confirmation of Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch is now uncertain because of the gridlock on the human trafficking bill. The bill would provide $30 million in restitution fees to help victims of human trafficking. Republicans included language preventing the money from being used for abortions. Democrats who both co-sponsored the bill and cleared it unanimously in committee on March 2 now want that language removed.” REID’S TOP AIDE TOLD WHITE HOUSE TO ‘BACK OFF’ ON INTERNET REGS National Journal: “The top aide to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid was quietly lobbying the White House last year against tough net-neutrality rules, according to internal documents released Tuesday. The emails, made public by the House Oversight Committee, contradict the ultimate position publicly taken by President Obama-and Reid himself. In an email to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on May 15, 2014, David Krone, Reid's chief of staff at the time, wrote that he ‘spoke with the WH [White House] again last night and told them to back off Title II [of the Communications Act].’ The section of the 1934 law would give the FCC broad powers and allow it to treat Internet providers more like heavily-regulated phone companies. ‘Went through once again the problems it creates for us,’ Krone wrote. Wheeler also initially favored a more-lenient approach.” DIRTY WORD YARD BIRD WTOP: “To passersby who don’t speak Spanish, signs for a new restaurant called ‘Chingon Pollo’ on N. Glebe Road in [Arlington, Va.] wouldn’t raise an eyebrow. Anyone who speaks the language, however, sees a name that could be construed, at best, as cheeky and, at worst, as profane. “Chingon” is a Spanish slang term that is often used as a compliment, but it’s a conjugation of the verb “chingar,” which in Mexico roughly translates to the English profanity that begins with “F.” ARLnow.com asked a Spanish speaker how she would interpret the name ‘Chingon Pollo.’ ‘Chingar is to f-ck and -on means real big ‘ol, so literally ‘real big ol f-cker’ but figuratively like ‘big f-cking’ something,’ she said, declining to be identified. … ‘That is crazy, I can’t believe they can name it that,’ she added. The name can also be translated more innocently as ‘damn good chicken.’” AND NOW, A WORLD FROM CHARLES… “This is really an elaborate scheme, very obvious, not done for convenience, but done to conceal…if you don't, if you willfully destroy the records, the penalty can be fines, imprisonment or both.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"“Lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.” – President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast today comparing Islamist militants to events in Western history. OBAMA MUSLIM MEETING SAID TO FOCUS ON ‘ALARMING RISE’ OF BIGOTRY The White House won’t say who attended a meeting between Muslim leaders andPresident Obama at the White House on Wednesday, but comedian Dean Obeidallah says he was there. Writing in the Daily Beast, Obeidallah said discrimination was the main topic: “In fact, it was clearly the No. 1 issue raised: The alarming rise in anti-Muslim bigotry in America.” Obeiallah is well known for his flame-throwing attacks on Republicans, referencing “the GOP’s World Cup of bat[s**t] crazy” and a racial joke about the adopted grandchild of 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. The comedian said he went to White House seeking help in encouraging Democrats to denounce Republicans’ comments on Islam. “My point was that while bigotry from certain Republicans is nothing new, I’m alarmed about the Democratic response to these comments. What is the Democrats’ response, you ask? Simple: silence.” He said Obama was very receptive: “While I can’t share the president’s exact response, I can tell you that he expressed his strong commitment to our community to fight anti-Muslim bigotry. I fully understand it’s not easy problem to remedy. But it was very heartening to hear the president’s passionate response.” Public figures deemed ‘private citizens’ - Obeidallah also said that the organizer of the event, Farhana Khera, a well-known attorney who has spearheaded efforts to limit law enforcement “profiling” of Muslims in terrorism investigations, was also in attendance. As for the other 13, we are left to wonder. Unlike a similar gathering with beneficiaries of the president’s temporary executive amnesty programs on Wednesday, for which extensive coverage was granted, the administration decided to withhold the names of the attendees for the Muslim event, saying that the participants were “private citizens” and that privacy was necessary so that they could share their “candid views” on a range of topics. AMNESTY COMPROMISE PLAN: KEEP KIDS BUT NOT ADULTS The Hill: “Sen. Susan Collins [R-Maine] has proposed compromise legislation she hopes could serve as the basis for a deal between congressional Republicans and the White House on President Obama's executive actions on immigration. The Maine centrist Republican filed an amendment Wednesday that would allow Obama's 2012 executive action to stand.That executive action set up the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals [DACA] program, which offers safe harbor to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who came to the country as children and have maintained a clean record. The Collins proposal would repeal Obama's executive action from November that would grant de facto legal status to the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, which would affect up to 5 million immigrants…The fight over the executive actions is taking place on legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Funding is set to lapse on Feb. 27. ‘I'm looking for a compromise that can bring an end to this impasse,’ Collins told reporters in the Capitol.” Called out - “At least seven of you Democratic colleagues have said you oppose President Obama's action. Well, when do you have a clearer chance to confront that action and to demonstrate with conviction that you meant what you said than on this vote? ”--Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., on the Senate floor Wednesday Senate leaders won’t tie A.G. nomination to amnesty fight - Dallas Morning News: “Sen. John Cornyn [R-Texas] said today that he opposes Loretta Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder. But unlike fellow Texas Sen. Ted Cruz [R-Texas], he wants the nomination brought to a vote… Last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [R-Ky.] said that despite anyone’s qualms about Lynch, he cannot see any justification for denying her a confirmation vote by the full Senate.” Dialed back - The Hill has recast the potential senatorial ambitions of a pair of Arizona Republican Congressmen described in an article as “considering” a challenge to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The Hill now says Reps. Matt Salmon and David Schweikert have “left the door open” to a possible run against the longtime senator and former GOP presidential nominee. ADMINISTRATION TAKES AGGRESSIVE STANCE ON NET REGS Fox News: “The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is proposing unprecedented rules to regulate Internet service providers, including mobile broadband, like a public utility, in a far-reaching move that could be one of the most divisive plans to emerge from the agency in years. In an op-ed in Wired magazine posted online, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said his plan would regulate Internet service much like phone service or any other public utility by applying Title II of the 1934 Communications Act. In doing so, the agency would prohibit providers from slowing down, speeding up or blocking web content. ‘I am submitting to my colleagues the strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC,’ he wrote…Net neutrality is the idea that Internet providers should not move some content faster than others or enter into paid agreements with companies such as Netflix to prioritize their data. Advocates for this approach say it would keep the Internet free and open, making content equally available to everyone and treating the Internet as a pipeline that must not restrict access.” [Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream reports in the latest installment of Regulation Nation.] Hmmmmm… - An unnamed “White House official” speaking to Politico about the duties of soon-to-depart White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer: “Over the last few months, he's been leading an internal review of how we structure our communications apparatus in a rapidly changing media environment - including meeting with Silicon Valley experts to develop recommendations for how we best communicate ... in the digital age. Dan will finish this project before departing in early-March.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Americans are consuming a lot of soy sauce these days. Depending on whether you classify salsa as a dip or a sauce, soy sauce ranks either third or fourth on the condiment hierarchy, outranked by only ketchup and the $2-billion king of the condiments, mayonnaise. Not bad for what started 2,000 years ago as fermented beans and wheat paste. The Atlantic looks at the story of soy sauce in America and, particularly, the quotidian clear plastic pouches of the stuff. Did you know that soy sauce for astronauts has to be extra potent because being in space deadens their sensitivity to the normally potent brew? Or would you believe that a former popsicle packager from the Bronx is the father of the package populating junk drawers and cabinet corners across the land? Or that what’s inside isn’t actually soy sauce? (Actually, you probably would believe that one.) The magazine even looks into the future of portable soy sauce for the increasingly discerning American palate. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The news ends speculation about whether the Republican establishment favorite, who passed on a conservative Freedom Summit in January that drew nine of his rivals, would avoid the state’s anti-establishment-leaning caucus crowd. Des Moines Register: “Bush intends to speak at the Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines on March 7. The former Florida governor has RSVP’ed along with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New York businessman Donald Trump, former Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, organizers and the contenders’ aides told The Des Moines Register…His announcement that he intends to brave Iowa waters, at least once, comes in the wake of a new Iowa Poll that shows he ranks in fifth place when it comes to GOP likely caucusgoers’ first choice for president.” ‘Right to Rise’ speech touts conservative polices to boost middle class - AP: “The nation’s economy can grow much faster by unshackling government burdens on business, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told an audience of influential Detroit-area business leaders on Wednesday in his first major economic speech as a 2016 Republican presidential prospect. In his address to the Detroit Economic Club…[Bush] offered the economic principles that would form the foundation of an economic platform, should he continue on the path toward a campaign….‘We believe that every American and in every community has a right to pursue happiness,’ he told the audience of 600. ‘They have a right to rise.’…Bush touted education as a way forward for struggling families, an issue he has long supported….The former governor also is in favor of paring down government, calling bloated bureaucracy, onerous taxes and voluminous regulations shackles to economic growth and American families’ ability to climb. Like father, like son - Hoover Institution’s Bill Whalen writes about the historical context for Bush’s speech: “Finally, from Bush: ‘If Americans are working harder than ever, earning less than they once did, our government, our leaders, should step up, fix what went wrong, or step aside.’ About that dare – ‘step up, fix what went wrong, or step aside.’ It raises a concern that’s going to dog Bush throughout the campaign. In a venue prone to talk of GNP and GDP, the man who would be America’s 45th president gave a speech with heavy overtones of ‘GBP’ – ‘Ghosts of Bushes Past.’ … In September 1992, the candidate’s father — at the time, the 41st President of the United States and an incumbent whose re-election chances were deeply in trouble — also made the sojourn to the Detroit Economic Club. There, he gave a speech outlining a much overdue economic vision … All of that, plus this dare to Congress: ‘lead, follow or get out of the way.’” The top of his pecking order - NYT: “Sally Bradshaw, a 49-year-old Mississippian…has been far away from the chickens and the farm, clearing a path for Jeb Bush to become president….As Jeb Bush’s facilitator, enforcer and sounding board for 20 years, Ms. Bradshaw does the political trench work that allows her boss to keep his head in the policy clouds. Just last week, the woman Mr. Bush called his ‘closest adviser for the entirety of my political career’ helped drive Mitt Romney, for whom she once worked, out of the race by poaching his former Iowa director …‘She has been integral to the decision process I am currently going through right now,’ Mr. Bush wrote in an email, describing Ms. Bradshaw, who declined to comment, as a straight-shooting ‘doer’ who inspires her troops and ‘gets the best from people.’” WALKER LOOKS TO HARNESS NATIONAL DONOR BASE WaPo: “It was not yet 8 a.m. on a recent Sunday morning, but a crowd of heavyweight GOP donors was gathered on the back patio of Carl and Jimmy Westcott’s desert vacation home to hear from Scott Walker. The eager reception for the Wisconsin governor and likely presidential candidate, who picked up a $100,000 check on the spot from one person at the Indian Wells, Calif., event, was repeated as he hopscotched across the country last week in the first fundraising tour for his new political committee…Fighting the unions became a national cause on the right. Rich conservatives rallied to Walker’s side, including influential donors who are part of a network organized by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch.…In all, Walker raised almost $83 million for his three statewide races in the past four years, an eye-popping sum for a governor of a modest-size Midwestern state. Of the nearly 300,000 people who gave to his campaigns, three out of four donated $75 or less, according to people familiar with the figures.” Miller, not bud for Walker - Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: “For the record, Gov. Scott Walker says he has never smoked marijuana. …Earlier this week, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican also interested in running, admitted he had smoked weed as a teenager. Walker was asked Wednesday if he has ever done the same. His answer: ‘No,’ Walker said. ‘The wildest thing I did in college was have a beer.’” RUBIO: THE MAN WITH A PLAN NRO’s Andrew Smith examines how Sen. Marco Rubio breaks away from the 2016 Republican field: “He wants to run on a detailed and novel conservative policy platform, if the book he put out in January, American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone, is any indication….A number of his policy proposals and his rhetoric align closely with what’s been dubbed the ‘reform conservative’ movement, a group of policy-minded intellectuals and journalists who’ve been pushing for a new, middle-class-focused conservative vision.” HILLARY BOOSTERS FUND ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT Daily Beast: “Albert Dwoskin and his wife, Claire, have been heavy hitters in Democratic politics for decades, boasting fundraisers with access to top Democratic leaders, even the Clintons. Bill Clinton has spoken at their mansion in McLean, Virginia twice. Albert, a real estate developer, donated more than $10,000 to Ready for Hillary, [Hillary Clinton’s] campaign in waiting, in 2013. That’s on top of the thousands of dollars both Clintons have received from the pair since the 1990s. But it’s Albert and Claire Dwoskin’s other hobby that is under scrutiny now. The Dwoskins fund a multimillion-dollar family foundation that has publicly tied the use of vaccines to a rise in autism, and is dedicated to addressing ‘gaps in the knowledge about the biological and genetic risk factors for vaccine induced brain and immune dysfunction.’ In other words, they’re vaccination skeptics. And the foundation is just one in a series of anti-vaxx projects that the wealthy couple bankrolls.” [Booked - Clinton’s celebrity doctor wrote a book on the alleged link between autism and vaccines with noted vaccine critic Robert Kennedy Jr.] The Judge’s Ruling: States, not feds rule on vaccines - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano writes about the political controversy surrounding the vaccination debate: “Under our Constitution, the states, and not the federal government, are the guardians of public health. That is an area of governance not delegated by the states to the feds. Of course, you’d never know this to listen to the debate today in which Big Government politicians, confident in the science, want a one-size-fits-all regimen.” PIGEON PAGEANTRY Move over Westminster. Nearly 8,000 birds and their owners flocked to the 93rd annual Grand National Pigeon Show last weekend in Ontario, Calif. AP reported on the scene, including the human star of the show: former boxer Mike Tyson who kicked off the event by releasing 100 white pigeons. Tyson maintains a personal flock of 1,800 birds and has kept birds since he was a child. The birds featured in the Grand National Show were all colors and varieties of breeds. Aside from varieties found in nature and those bred for shows, the birds can also be raised as racing animals. “Racing pigeons are the Ben Johnsons of the world and fancy pigeons are the Naomi Campbells of the world,” said Fadiel Hendricks, president of the National Fancy Pigeon Association of South Africa. However, it is an aging hobby with 90 percent of breeders over the age of 50. Bob Nolan of the Los Angeles Pigeon Club, blames technology for the lack of interest among younger demographics. Tyson agrees there is a problem among the younger demographic but finds the hobby peaceful, watching his birds for hours. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “The disinterest, the lethargy of this president, the lassitude with which he pursues this war which he declared himself is simply astonishing…Jordan, which is our staunchest ally in the area, is short of weaponry, short of munitions, and it takes forever for that to get through. It shouldn’t even be an issue.” —Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here. Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"First there’s the question of whether Palin really might get into the 2016 sweepstakes. I’m with the skeptics on this one: Palin hasn’t run for anything since quitting the Alaska governorship in the middle of her term. She talked up her interest in the 2012 race and then sat it out. She hasn’t hired any staff or put together even a skeleton organization.","490","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"

"“First, Palin embarked on an extended stream-of-consciousness complaint about media coverage of her decision to run in a half-marathon race in Storm Lake, Iowa in 2011. She then moved on to grumbling about coverage of a recent photo of her with a supporter who had made a sign saying ‘F*** you Michael Moore’ in reaction to the left-wing moviemaker's criticism of the film ‘American Sniper.’ Then it was on to Palin's objections about the social media ruckus over a picture of her six-year-old son Trig standing on the family's Labrador Retriever.","494","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"

"“‘Long and disjointed,’ said one social conservative activist when asked for reaction. ‘A weird speech,’ said another conservative activist. ‘Terrible. Didn't make any sense.’","497","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"
"“‘There was a certain coarseness to her that wasn't there before,’ said yet another social conservative who noted that some in the crowd were uncomfortable with Palin declarations like, ‘Screw the left in Hollywood!’”","498","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"
"And there was this on-the-record critique: “‘I know she is popular, but it is hard to take her seriously given that performance,’ said Sam Clovis, the conservative Iowa college professor, radio commentator, and sometime political candidate. ‘Palin was a sad story Saturday.

"“The former 2008 vice-presidential nominee told reporters last week that she was “seriously” considering running in 2016. But her meandering and often bizarre 33-minute speech in Des Moines proved she wasn’t. Sample line: ‘The man can only ride you when your back is bent, so strengthen it so America won’t get taken for a ride.’ She will always be an entertaining speaker at conservative events, but she clearly lacks the discipline for a full-fledged campaign.”","501","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"
"So while Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Carson and Huckabee drew strong reviews — and Chris Christie not so much — I think it’s fair to say that Palin didn’t help herself with that speech.","502","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"
"Now a single Iowa gathering in January of 2015 doesn’t mean much. And in no way am I underestimating Palin’s popularity with conservative audiences, or her ability to connect with those audiences when she’s on. She’s also a fascinating figure for the media, which boost their ratings and clicks whenever they cover her.","503","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"
"I think some in the media were unfair to Sarah Palin during her VP run, and I also think she suffered from self-inflicted wounds. But when she went the reality show/best-selling book route after giving up the governorship, she seemed to veer more toward becoming a pop-culture celebrity than a political player.","504","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"
"That doesn’t mean Palin can’t get back in the game; Jeb Bush’s last election was in 2002.

"“But, here's the thing: There is NO indication that Palin is ‘seriously’ doing anything that would indicate any real interest in the race aside, of course, from doing that easiest thing of all: Just saying it.","506","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"
"“This has been Palin's M.O. since she was the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2008. She hints at the possibility that she might run, a hint that sends all of those who love and hate her -- there are tons of both -- into a tizzy. But, there's never any ‘there’ there. And, it's worth calling it out.”","507","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"
"There was one other famous name out in Des Moines, and that was Donald Trump. As much as I enjoyed covering his pre-campaign last time, I don’t think anyone seriously believes The Donald is going to trade “The Apprentice” for a grueling two-year campaign. And unless Palin starts making 2016 preparations soon, she’s going to be viewed as in the Trump category.","508","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/27/panning-palin-why-conservative-media-are-dismissing-her-2016-prospects.html"

"Buzz Cut: • Hillary lets Dems twist on her email scandal • Clintons count on cowed, complicit press • Can Jeb do Iowa? • Perry super PAC launches • They don’t cover pre-existing conditions","523","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/06/hillary-lets-dems-twist-on-her-email-scandal.html"
"HILLARY LETS DEMS TWIST ON HER EMAIL SCANDAL Democrats are having plenty of Ralph Kramden moments when asked about Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. If anything frightens lawmakers more than 4 inches of snow, it is the prospect of getting crossways with Clinton’s communications cutthroats. But they’re not giving Democrats much to work with here. Lashing out at the NYT and trying to shift the blame to the Obama administration is not exactly putting Hill Democrats in their sweet spot. And when the subject – lack of transparency and ethical concerns – goes to the heart of the party’s misgivings about its presumptive nominee, it’s that much tougher. [Literally? – “I literally don’t know anything about her home internet system.” – Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., when asked about the scandal by National Journal.] While the party will eventually unite (mostly) behind Clinton, seeking to defend her from the “vast right wing conspiracy” she will blame for this debacle, this will leave a stain. The subtle shift in thinking that may be the most consequential is this: Once Democrats wondered if they needed a primary challenger to Hillary to get her to move left and to tune her up for the general. Now they wonder if one won’t be necessary in case Hillary blows up like the Death Star. That shift opens the door for potential challengers, particularly Biden and O’Malley to make a case for their candidacies that is not explicitly ideological, but a practical consideration for the party. For Liz Warren, meanwhile, the moment may be growing nearer when she could deliver what is the single gravest threat to the Clintons’ effort to return to power. Just in case you ever need them… - Vice President Joe Biden will address gay rights activists tonight in Washington D.C. and Former Gov. Martin O’Malley, D-Md., is set to spend the weekend in New Hampshire, delivering a keynote address tonight at a fundraiser for the Merrimack County Democratic Committee and the Concord City Democrats. On Saturday, he will appear at a fundraiser for the New Hampshire Democratic Party and later will deliver the keynote address at the Washington Days banquet in Topeka, Kansas. Use discredit to discredit - Jackie Kucinich and Tim Mak report on how Democrats are using the new revelations about Clinton’s secret email server to attack the House committee charged with unraveling the causes and cover-up of the 2012 Islamist raid on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. [NYT: “‘It’s a ball of wool that won’t go away until the questions are answered,’ said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.”] CLINTONS COUNT ON COWED, COMPLICIT PRESS How does Hillary Clinton think that she will get away with blowing off reporters even as she attends public events that are part of her still-unregistered presidential campaign, including a weekend shindig for her controversial family foundation? Or even more overtly political events and not answer for a mounting list of questions about her decision to evade federal rules about her emails as Secretary of State? She is counting on a complicit press. And she is likely to be largely obliged. Walls of stone - Jennifer Epstein gives us a valuable view from the Clinton war room: “The hope of Clinton’s inner circle is that she’ll be able to address the e-mail controversy as a minor element of her expected announcement. Agreeing to an interview now or at any time before she’s ready to launch her campaign would be potentially detrimental, signaling that she’s shifted into damage control mode and drawing attention to an issue about which many voters are still unaware, said a former Clinton campaign aide who has knowledge of the current team’s thinking. It would also appear to challenge her aides’ assertions that she did nothing wrong.” Royal treatment - Peggy Noonan, never more indispensable than in moments like these, explains why some in the press are going knock-kneed: With the exception of the moment Wednesday when a hardy reporter from TMZ actually went to an airport and shouted a query at Mrs. Clinton—it was just like the old days of journalism, with a stakeout and shouted queries—Mrs. Clinton hasn’t been subjected to any questions from the press. She’s slide, she’ll glide, she’ll skate. (With TMZ she just walked on, smiling.) … Why doesn’t the legacy press swarm her on this? Because she is political royalty. They are used to seeing her as a regal, queenly figure. They’ve been habituated to understand that Mrs. Clinton is not to be harried, not to be subjected to gotcha questions or impertinent grilling. She is a Democrat, a star, not some grubby Republican governor from nowhere. And they don’t want to be muscled by her spokesmen.” [Fox News: “Hillary Clinton appears to have established multiple email addresses for her private use, and possibly the use of her aides, under the domain of ‘clintonemail.com,’ according to a prominent member of the hacking community who supplied independent research data, conducted with high-tech tools, to Fox News.”] Downtrend - In the latest Fox News poll, taken just before the email scandal broke, found that 61 percent of voters thought the foreign donations to Clinton’s family foundation represented a conflict of interest. Only 44 percent of respondents said they would describe Hillary as honest, down 10 points from last year and just 1 point better than President Obama. Power Play: Did you have to let it linger? - Hillary Clinton’s decision to use private email as Secretary of State is raising major questions about her secrecy and accountability. Brad Blakeman, former George W. Bush adviser and radio host Garland Nixon join Chris Stirewalt ponder whether this scandal will stick and end Clinton’s prospects for a White House bid. WATCH HERE. [What if Clinton crumbles? Blakeman and Nixon flesh out the possibilities. WATCH HERE.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... The Motown hit, “My Girl” became The Temptations’ first number one hit on this day 50 years ago. Written by Smokey Robinson and Ronald White, this was the first all-male group to have a number one Motown. In this previous interview with WSJ, Robinson provides some insight into the song’s origins, saying, “I didn’t set out to write ‘My Girl’ for the Miracles and me to record. My wife at the time wasn’t the inspiration, either…I wrote ‘My Girl’ in 1964 specifically for the Temptations, with hopes they would make it a hit.” Wanting to do something different, Robinson focused on composing a song with David Ruffin in the lead role rather than Eddie Kendricks. He had key and chord changes in mind and the melody simply came after that. The single was quickly released and a few months later, Berry Gordy, Motown’s owner, gave Robinson a $1,000 bonus check saying, “You’ve got a number one record coming.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 43.9 percent//Disapprove – 51.5 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 32.2 percent//Wrong Track – 59.3 percent CAN JEB DO IOWA? As top 2016 contender Jeb Bush makes his first foray into Iowa today, a big question looms: Can he block conservative challenger, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker? The former Florida governor will be starting on friendly turf as he courts members of a trade group looking to preserve ethanol subsidies, but how will he fare with the social and small government conservatives who dominate the state? As the latest Fox News poll shows, the Bush name provides an advantage over lesser known rivals. And while Jeb will score points with ethanol enthusiasts like Gov. Terry Branstad, his moderate views don’t sit well with Iowa’s conservative caucus goers. [Jeb Bush will appear at a fundraiser tonight for Rep. David Young, R-Iowa in Urbandale, Iowa] Needs a base crack up - If Walker can hold his spot as the consensus conservative choice, a posture which won him a 15-point advantage in the Quinnipiac Iowa poll out this week, Bush could be frozen out of the nomination. One way for Jeb to achieve a breakout would be the approach his brother used in 2000 to win Iowa: Appeal to the social conservatives who are less concerned about issues that trouble other activists on the right, particularly immigration, and who share Bush’s opposition to abortion and fervent faith. If Bush can peel off enough of those caucus goers to add to his moderate, pro-business coalition, he could emerge ahead of a crowded field for an Iowa win. [Hawkeye happenings - The Iowa Agriculture Summit is set to kick off Saturday at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines with numerous presidential contenders scheduled to appear including former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., former Gov. George Pataki, R-N.Y., former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., businessman Donald Trump and Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis.] “[Jeb Bush] reminds me of the man who grumbles about his old-fashioned and boring Episcopalian church, but can’t bring himself to leave because his great-grandfather donated the church bell, and his mother was buried in the graveyard.” – Cary Gordon, a Christian conservative pastor at a Sioux City church talking to The Des Moines Register about why Bush is still a Republican. [The AEI World Forum in Sea Island, Georgia continues. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas and former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., are slated to speak today with Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., Governor Bobby Jindal, R-La., and Governor Mike Pence, R-Ind. scheduled for Saturday.] Rubio’s wealthy backers make big bets - WaPo: “Jeb Bush’s success in rounding up GOP donors as he pursues a likely presidential run has created a big question for his fellow Floridian Marco Rubio: Will there be any money left for him? That’s where Norman Braman comes in. The billionaire Miami auto dealer and longtime Rubio benefactor is expected to put as much as $10 million into a pro-Rubio super PAC if the senator decides to run, according to people familiar with his plans. ‘If there is a super PAC that’s founded, I will give substantially,’ Braman said in an interview, declining to be more specific. ‘I don’t pay any attention to that other distinguished Floridian,’ he added, referring to the former governor…Support from Braman, a former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles football team, is exactly what the 43-year-old first-term senator needs…” Rand bagged ‘Parks and Recreation’ cameo - The Hill: “Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) turned down a cameo on the NBC television show ‘Parks and Recreation’ at the last minute, its co-creator said in an interview published Wednesday. ‘We also wanted Rand Paul to be in the Washington episode, and he agreed, but then bailed at the eleventh hour,’ Mike Schur said in a conversation with HitFix. ‘I think he thought we were making fun of him, or something, which we were not, at all. We were in fact flattering him, by linking him to Ron. I get the sense that maybe interpreting writing and humor is not his strong suit.’” [Watch Fox: Sen.

Rick Perry readies a second presidential campaign his supporters have created a super PAC devoted to his 2016 ambitions. A handful of former aides and allies on Thursday launched the Opportunity and Freedom PAC, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on Perry's behalf. ‘We want to focus on introducing Rick Perry to the voters of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - and throughout the country,’ Austin Barbour, a senior adviser for the new organization, said in an interview with The Associated Press. ‘I don't think when he ran in `11 and `12 many people got a chance to truly understand his background. He's got an incredible story to tell.’” Pro-Hillary group leader on Christie: ‘We want to kill him dead’ - Daily Caller: “The president of a Democrat super PAC dedicated to digging up opposition research on Republicans said of New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie: ‘We want to kill him dead.’ Brad Woodhouse, the president of the liberal super PAC American Bridge, made the provocative comments in a profile of the organization published by Bloomberg Politics. The story notes that American Bridge would not back off its attacks on Christie. ‘We’re not going to pull resources from Christie,’ Woodhouse told the outlet. ‘We want to kill him dead.’ Woodhouse, a longtime Democratic operative, has often accused Republicans of using offensive rhetoric against President Obama.

THEY DON’T COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AP: “Authorities say a Pennsylvania man called an insurance company from a crash scene to buy auto coverage and later claimed his wreck happened after he got the policy. The Altoona Mirror reports that the insurance fraud charges filed this week against 33-year-old Michael Traveny stem from an Aug. 21 crash in Duncansville. State prosecutors say Traveny didn’t have insurance when he crashed that night so he called Safe Auto Insurance from the scene and purchased coverage without mentioning the wreck. Prosecutors say Traveny filed a $3,900 claim the next day claiming the crash happened after the policy took effect. Online court records don’t list an attorney for Traveny. He faces a preliminary hearing March 17.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is not a new story, and that’s the reason why the Democrats are so dismayed…she’s a Clinton and what the Clintons do is never clear the air. They spend the first month or two, surrogates, the machine attacking the accusers, as in the Lewinsky scandal and later, if you have to confess, if you’re caught red-handed, you admit it…And then she’s going to have to answer, why don’t you turn them over?…She can’t do it because, the answers to the questions, if remotely honest, are self-indicting.” —Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"Reuters reported early Thursday that the errors on form 990s include under-reporting or over-reporting by millions of dollars the amounts donated by foreign governments, as well as not disclosing the donations as separate from total revenue. Reuters also reported that officials may audit other returns filed by the Clinton Foundation as far back as 15 years ago in the event of more errors being found.","553","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/23/clinton-charities-reportedly-will-refile-tax-returns-due-to-foreign-donation.html?intcmp=HPBucket"

"After all, while it’s true that Trump is new to politics, his reputation as a first-rate opportunist precedes him. It’s impossible to know whether he really believes what he’s saying, or just saying it for effect to woo nativists in the GOP — of which there are now, sadly, a sizable number.","633","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/06/24/donald-trump-mexican-americans-take.html"
"The bright spot to Trump’s rant against Mexican immigrants, it may be that it reveals the Devil’s bargain that so many Republicans feel they have to strike to win elective office.

"Frankly, I’m not worried about Trump and his tantrums. What is of greater concern to me is that there is a whole chorus of 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls who, in January, came running when Rep. Steve King, perhaps the most anti-immigrant member of Congress, convened an event in Des Moines called the Iowa Freedom Summit. Trump was there. But so was former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Ben Carson.","635","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/06/24/donald-trump-mexican-americans-take.html"
"King has suggested using electrified fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep out immigrants because “we do that with livestock all the time” and accused so-called Dreamers, those undocumented young people brought here as children, of being drug mules with “calves the size of cantaloupes.”","636","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/06/24/donald-trump-mexican-americans-take.html"

The fact that he could get through a mini-diatribe on people emigrating to the United States without mentioning that they’re being welcomed by U.S. employers — among them farmers, ranchers, hoteliers, restauranteurs, construction firms, and the American homeowner — proves that, despite his knack for self-promotion, for the latest Republican to enter the presidential race, immigration is just another big word.","641","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/06/24/donald-trump-mexican-americans-take.html"

"The NBC/Survey Monkey poll, which was conducted online during for the 24 hours from Friday evening into Saturday, showed Trump well on top of the field with 23 percent and Ted Cruz in second play with 13 percent. The PPP poll out of Iowa released Monday also has Trump in the lead with 19 percent support, well ahead of neurosurgeon Ben Carson with 12 percent and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker with 11 percent.","710","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/11/why-everyone-is-talking-about-donald-trump-carly-fiorina-and-almost-no-one-else.html"
"Many said that the NBC/Survey Monkey poll may not be as methodologically sound as some other polls. An examination of it by both myself and Pat Caddell – we have a combined 90 years of experience in survey research – led us both to conclude that the results were nothing else but credible, and at the very least are indicative of broad trends which show Trump continuing to hold onto the bulk of his support and remain a polarizing figure. The PPP poll bears this out.","711","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/11/why-everyone-is-talking-about-donald-trump-carly-fiorina-and-almost-no-one-else.html"
"The results also revealed former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina gaining support. Fiorina was widely agreed upon as the “winner” of the 5 pm debate – 22 percent said she won the debate – and many even touted her as having won both debates that night, with the shadow of her high quality performance earlier in the evening looming over the prime time show. Fiorina’s is climbing the polls in Iowa: she now garners 10 percent support and is in the top five as well as boasting a 56/15 approval rating as compared to 30/15 in April.","712","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/11/why-everyone-is-talking-about-donald-trump-carly-fiorina-and-almost-no-one-else.html"

"Over on the Democratic side, the poll evidence in the last couple of weeks shows Hillary Clinton trending down and Bernie Sanders trending up, whether it be in national polling or state polling. In Iowa, Sanders stands at 25 percent to Clinton’s 52 percent, gaining substantial ground. As for the national polls, Monmouth’s latest has Clinton with a 36-point advantage over Sanders, which is substantive, but used to be upwards of 50 points over the entire field. Furthermore, Sanders has polled within six points of Clinton in New Hampshire.","714","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/11/why-everyone-is-talking-about-donald-trump-carly-fiorina-and-almost-no-one-else.html"

"Similarly on the Democratic side, there is a sense in the electorate that the game is rigged. To be sure the prescription is a very different one. There is a desire for redistribution rather than free markets, a desire for inclusive politics, rather than more particularistic politics, but make no mistake about it, the electorate is sending a loud message.","718","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/11/why-everyone-is-talking-about-donald-trump-carly-fiorina-and-almost-no-one-else.html"

"The Donald Trump phenomenon may not last and Bernie Sanders most likely not be the Democratic nominee, but it would be a profound mistake not to understand that American politics is being upended, much like politics in Europe has also been. The only difference is that our system does not easily accommodate the kind of protests we are seeing widely and broadly in the electorate.","722","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/11/why-everyone-is-talking-about-donald-trump-carly-fiorina-and-almost-no-one-else.html"

"When the administration was called out by immigration activists for deporting 2 million people and dividing hundreds of thousands of families, Obama and his surrogates hid behind the claim that the majority of those removed were criminals. White House strategists must have figured out early on that most Americans — even many Hispanics who support immigration reform — would have less sympathy for hoodlums than housekeepers.","731","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"The strategy became to have administration officials such as Janet Napolitano, the former Homeland Security Secretary, and Cecilia Munoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council, publicize the claim that — for instance, in 2011 — as many as 55 percent of those deported that year had, besides entering the country illegally, also committed crimes once they got here.","732","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"The spinners would have gotten away with it if researchers with the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, hadn’t crunched the numbers and found that, in 2011, only about 14.9 percent of the people deported were actually charged with a criminal offense. The other 85.1 percent were folks who were trying to earn a living, working as nannies or gardeners. The typical Obama deportee wasn’t a murderer or rapist but a lady selling tamales outside a supermarket without a permit, a battered wife picked up after calling the police on her husband, or the father of a child with terminal cancer. You can see why the administration didn’t want to advertise the true details of its deportation record, since it doesn’t exactly cover the White House in glory.","733","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"Obama is fond of one phrase in particular, in discussing Mexican immigrants: “gang banger.” He uses it as a crutch.","734","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"During the 2012 presidential election, Obama said this during a debate: “What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families. And that's what we've done.”","735","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"And just a few weeks ago, at a town hall in Madison, Wisconsin, Obama responded to a question about whether Obamacare would be expanded to cover “sick migrant people” by saying this: “We should not be encouraging illegal immigration. What we should be doing is setting up a smart, legal immigration system that doesn’t separate families, but does focus on making sure that people who are dangerous, people who are gang-bangers or criminals — that we’re deporting them as quickly as possible.”","736","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"

"Now Trump is singing Obama’s song and adding a few verses of his own. The mouthy mogul wants to get tough on Mexico by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and sending our neighbor the bill. He also says that, in 2003, instead of going into Iraq, “we should have invaded Mexico.”","738","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"Been there, done that too. Even though he's one of the biggest landlords in the United States, Trump apparently hasn't considered the consequences if Mexico retaliates for the wall stunt by collecting rent from the millions of inhabitants of the eight states in the Southwest stolen by the United States in 1848 while the young nation was intoxicated by Manifest Destiny.","739","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"

"That seems a little steep. Trump is supposed to be a master negotiator. If he is really that desperate for more illegal immigrants to help Americans cut their lawns, cook their food, clean their homes, pick their vegetables, and wipe their kids’ noses, he should just ask for those additional immigrants nicely. I’m sure Mexico will give him a better price.","741","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"Trump is a dream come true for Democrats, who prefer to get the Hispanic vote the old fashioned way: by not earning it. Hispanic outreach is sticky for Democrats because they’d rather spend their campaign dollars to court soccer moms and because African-Americans complain about playing second fiddle to a group that they perceive to be the new kid on the block. So the safest path for Democrats is to go before Hispanic voters with a simple message: “We may be mediocre but at least we’re not Republicans.”","742","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"

"The Department of Homeland Security puts the number at about 11.5 million people as of that agency’s latest common-core approved arithmetic performed in 2012.

However, since the left subscribes to the infallibility of President Obama, let’s not issue a challenge to his Department of Homeland Security.

"One could make the argument that having a couple of centuries of American exceptionalism in their collective experience, Massachusetts can claim morally superior and more cultured people, despite having forced us to suffer the occasional Boston strangler, Salem witch trial or botched Chappaquiddick police investigation.

"I concede the number I’m using of 4,418 for sexual assaults per year by the illegally residing Mexican population, because that’s the number committed in the similarly populated state of Massachusetts, could be wrong. The Government Accounting Office did a study and found over a 7-year period illegal immigrants were arrested nearly 70,000 times for sexual assault, and 68% of those people were of Mexican origin, averaging 6,800 arrests per year for sexual offenses.","770","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/17/gentlemans-guide-to-donald-trump-s-remarks-about-illegal-immigrant-crime.html"

However, a Trump spokesman has since confirmed that the much-in-demand hat would go on sale at his campaign site, and it's already available at Trump Tower in Manhattan.

"Former Governor Jeb Bush failed to excite. His delivery was not crisp, and once again he got himself tangled up answering a question about the Iraq war.

"Rand Paul seemed on the defensive, and did not impress. Though the country is tired of war, people are alarmed about ISIS, Iran, China and Russia.

From the look of things, Trump's decision to run for president just might be the best thing to hit late night TV since the GOP added Sarah Palin and her uncanny Tina Fey resemblance to the Republican ticket.","Published July 02, 2015","865","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/07/02/trump-run-for-president-is-best-prop-for-late-night-comedy-since-sarah-palin.html"
"What makes Trump such irresistible late night comedy fodder is his infamous willingness to speak his mind, whether that be trumpeting his net worth or blatantly offending and alienating large groups of people. It's just not something we're used to seeing in politics.","866","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/07/02/trump-run-for-president-is-best-prop-for-late-night-comedy-since-sarah-palin.html"
"For example, when Trump landed himself in hot water with his inflammatory remarks on immigration (during his campaign kickoff no less), he was completely unapologetic. Even after his comments cost him his business relationships with Univision and NBC, the mogul remained unabashed. Virtually anyone else would have backpedaled to some degree, but not Trump; he simply vowed to lawyer up -- and then promptly brought his case to the court of public opinion, aka social media. In a particularly snarky tweet from July 1, Trump referred to the president of NBC as a ""very loyal guy.""","867","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/07/02/trump-run-for-president-is-best-prop-for-late-night-comedy-since-sarah-palin.html"
"The buzz around the former Celebrity Apprentice host hasn't been surprising. In fact, it's more or less exactly what many expected, and even hoped, to see since Trump began toying with the idea of running years ago. In August 2013, John Oliver was filling in for Jon Stewart on The Daily Show when rumors surfaced that Trump was planning a 2016 bid. In his ""Can't You At Least Wait Until Jon Stewart Gets Back"" segment, he enthusiastically encouraged him to go for it. Said Oliver at the time, ""I will personally write you a campaign check now on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president but which badly wants you to run.""","868","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/07/02/trump-run-for-president-is-best-prop-for-late-night-comedy-since-sarah-palin.html"
"Since Trump made his bid official, late night hosts have been giddy over the news. A bit from The Nightly Show perfectly portrayed the excitement of comedians everywhere. In it, host Larry Willmore received a gift box that indicated it was from ""the comedy gods."" When he opened it, he found a screen inside playing a video clip of Trump's announcement. Lights shone down from heaven and angels sang.","869","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/07/02/trump-run-for-president-is-best-prop-for-late-night-comedy-since-sarah-palin.html"
"Stephen Colbert, who doesn't even officially take the reins of The Late Show until Sept. 8, couldn't resist posting a response on YouTube (see below). He made an announcement of his own, which doubled as a chance to show off his best comb-over, New York accent, and Trump mannerisms. ""Donald Trump's campaign for President of the United States is not just great for America,"" the comedian declared, ""it's great for late night television because Donald's presidential campaign has inspired me, Stephen Colbert, to announce that I will still be hosting the late show on CBS."" He added that ""Donald Trump running for president is going to make late night television great again.""","870","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/07/02/trump-run-for-president-is-best-prop-for-late-night-comedy-since-sarah-palin.html"
"And it already has. From a fake game called Trump Stumpers, in which contestants were asked to determine whether the candidate actually made specific outrageous claims (the answer was always yes) to comedians trying to make the most Trump-like, bragging statements, entire segments have been devoted to the hotelier's campaign -- and again, it's just over two weeks old. Jon Stewart gleefully acknowledged the potential, going so far as to thank Trump on the June 23 episode of The Daily Show. ""Thank you, Donald Trump for making my last six weeks [as show host] my best six weeks,"" he said.","871","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/07/02/trump-run-for-president-is-best-prop-for-late-night-comedy-since-sarah-palin.html"

"We’ve all focused on Trump’s television interviews, more than 70 so far, the latest on low-rated Bloomberg TV with Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. But Trump talks to all kinds of journalists.

"DONALD TRUMP IDENTIFIES AS A PERSON OF SERIOUSNESS Donald Trump has presented in the past as a Democratic donor, a Perotist, a reality-show star and areal-estate mogul. But today, Trump is sharing his new identity with America: a serious contender for the Republican nomination. Ranked by Forbes as the 133rdrichest person in America, Trump’s fame combined with the diffuse support in the GOP electorate, gives him a unique opportunity. He currently ranks eighth in the Real Clear Politics average of polls with 3.6 percent, ahead of six others, including the current governors of Ohio and Louisiana and the former governor of Texas. And it would no doubt be pretty tough to have a distinguished public life and accomplishments are overshadowed by the man who made this commercial. If Trump can sustain his spot and make the necessary financial disclosures, he could make the top 10 for the Aug. 6 Fox News debate – a coup for him and for journalists who have been looking to dust off “clown car” ledes for GOP primary coverage. But Trump, whose presidential flirtations date back 20 years, isn’t really the story. The story is about a party that is so anxious to avoid mistakes that it seems frozen. Conservatives in particular cannot bring themselves to decide or even cull their field. Looking at it one way, the first contest is more than seven months away and Republicans are right to bide their time to see what develops and who else might show up. Looking at it another way, the longer Republicans wait to sort themselves out, the more likely they will be to do what they have done in the previous two cycles and pit an underfunded conservative favorite against a deep-pocketed establishmentarian in an embittering home-stretch fight. Republicans who really believe that the field is wide open ought to look again at Jeb Bush’s announcement speech in Miami on Tuesday. Gone was the reticent candidate and present was an enthusiastic, combative candidate who was firing hard at Democrats and, obliquely, at his home-state rival Marco Rubio. Bush was touting his conservative bona fides, but he was also making an electability argument. And as it becomes clearer and clearer that Democrats are not flinching when it comes to rallying behind the House of Clinton, Bush’s electability argument will gain strength. The narrative will gather for the Game of Thrones election. Meanwhile, conservatives having seen their efforts come to naught in previous cycles are decisively undecided. Voters are sorting through their options like kids with baseball cards. Could it be the political neophyte surgeon? The bass-playing preacher-turned-politician? The firebrand freshman senator from Texas? Pick ‘em. Trade ‘em. Collect ‘em all! But conservatives ought to remember that if the field were not so crowded, Trump’s less than 4 percent would be an irrelevancy. But with conservatives split eight ways, Trump is in the discussion. [Watch Fox: Senior Correspondent Eric Shawn reports on the Trump announcement from New York] Bush takes aim at Rubio - National Review: “…Much of [Jeb’s campaign launch] seemed implicitly targeted at [Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.]…The two share a fundraising base in Florida, making Rubio a serious rival for donors and supporters in the crucial primary state and across the country. The Bush campaign made clear Monday that it is aware of the threat posed by the younger Florida politician. An hour before Bush took the stage, a surrogate told the audience that she wanted to introduce “a couple of people” who support him. She then read off a laundry list of former and current officeholders and party operatives…” On to New Hampshire - Bush holds a town hall event in Derry, N.H., where he will also sit down with Sean Hannity for his first post-announcement interview. Watch “Hannity” tonight at 10 p.m. ET. Also tonight, Bush chats with Jimmy Fallon the “Tonight Show.” [Watch Fox: Chief Political Correspondent Campaign Carl Cameron is on the trail with Bush in Derry, N.H.] Rubio calls out Obama, sideswipes Rand - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in a Time magazine op-ed writes about the dangers of President Obama’s foreign policy agenda, specifically allowing the Patriot Act’s data collection to expire. But his fellow Republicans get a dose too: “Unfortunately, misinformation, fear-mongering and the allure of campaign fundraising all contributed to [the Patriot Act’s data collection] expiration, its explicit prohibition in the future, and its replacement with a weaker and untested system that fails to require phone companies to maintain records that we may one day need to track terrorists. Rather than use what power remains in his bully pulpit, President Obama opted to be a bystander and let this program be killed…As a result, the American people are now less safe.” Walker eyeing July 13? - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports, “…three insiders said the Republican governor and his campaign staff are targeting July 13 as the date for Walker to make the big announcement. There has been some discussion of having it later in that week, but most have settled on July 13, a Monday.” Walker’s team has yet to confirm or deny this. Carson, Walker, Rubio, Bush stay out front in new poll - In a Monmouth University poll out Monday, Ben Carson leads the pack with 11 percent up 4 points from the university’s last poll in April. Carson is closely followed by Walker at 10 percent, and Floridians Bush and Rubio tied at 9 percent. The numbers slowly dwindle down from there showing more than anything that the GOP nomination is pretty well up for grabs. [Carson holds a rally at the University of Nevada at Reno.] Kasich makes few ripples in S.C. - Ohio Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, made his way through the Palmetto State. How did it go? The Columbus Dispatch headline was looking for a silver lining: “Kasich’s candor appreciated by the few who show up to listen.”Kasich is in Michigan today for a meet and greet with the small business association in Lansing. Later, he attends a reception with Ingham County Republican in Mason. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… When the Moleskine notebook debuted in1997, it was marketed in J. Peterman fashion – a product for romantics and travelers in a society going paperless. But within a few years of its introduction, the product’s popularity surged in the high-tech world. The New Yorker explains the phenomenon that put the distinctive notebooks in the hands of MIT students, entrepreneurs, and even tech-giants. The reason, says David Allen creator of the time-management method, “Getting Things Done,” is that note-taking or to-do lists on the iPhone are interrupted by an incoming text, email, call, or all of the above. A notebook is only filled with what you put into it. So whether free writing ideas or making a lengthy list put the screen aside and reach for an old-fashioned pad and pen. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 44.0 percent//Disapprove – 51.0 Directions of Country: Right Direction – 28.6 percent//Wrong Track – 61.8 percent NEW DOUBTS ON HILLARY’S DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION Fox News: “Dozens of emails handed over to Congress from a longtime Clinton confidant were not part of the trove of emails originally submitted by the State Department, Fox News has learned -- raising questions over why those emails were apparently withheld. One source told Fox News the newly submitted emails from Sidney Blumenthal show a ‘significant gap’ in the record. Blumenthal was scheduled to testify in closed session Tuesday to the House panel probing the Benghazi attacks about frequent emails on Libya he sent to Hillary Clinton when she served as secretary of state. Blumenthal worked in the White House under President Clinton and is a longtime friend and adviser to the Clinton family.” NYT: “The committee has asked the State Department and Mrs. Clinton several times in the past year for emails from her and other department officials about ‘weapons located or found in’ Libya and about the decision to open and maintain a diplomatic mission in Benghazi…. It is not clear whether the State Department possesses the emails between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Blumenthal and did not hand them over. It is also possible that Mrs. Clinton never provided them to the department and deleted them off the server that housed the personal account she used exclusively when she was secretary of state.” Clintons soaked small charities- The Clinton Foundation has raked in $11M in payments from small non-profit groups for speeches by Hillary, Bill and Chelsea, Politico reports. “When Condoleezza Rice headlined a 2009 fundraising luncheon for the Boys and Girls Club of Long Beach, she collected a $60,000 speaking fee, then donated almost all of it back to the club ... Hillary Clinton was not so generous to the small charity ... Clinton collected $200,000 to speak at the same event five years later, but she donated nothing back to the club ... Instead, Clinton steered her speaking fee to her family's own ... charity.” Oh, Hill no: Campaign fights with press over coverage - Fox News: “The simmering dispute over media access to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign erupted again Monday when a reporter for DailyMail.com was told by the campaign he couldn’t attend her events in New Hampshire. David Martosko, a reporter for DailyMail.com, a website affiliated with the Daily Mail in London, said the Clinton camp said his newspaper wasn’t part of the official group -- known as the print pool -- that covers the White House on a rotating basis. As a result, he was blocked Monday from covering her events in person for the pool…. The campaign said it is trying to resolve the issue. However, it denied any suggestion that Martosko was denied access because of his newspaper’s critical coverage of Clinton….Major media organizations in Clinton’s traveling press pool issued a statement Monday night defending Martosko and rejecting any attempt by the Clinton campaign to “dictate” who covers the candidate. “…[T]his is just one thing that she doesn’t get to control. She wants press covering her. That whole goal for politicians is to have the people covering them. And then we the press get this idea, but one of them is, who is going to go in there and represent us. And now the campaign, first they came out and they said, well, you’re foreign press. And you responded by saying, there’s lots of foreign press and they’ve acted as pool before.” -- David Martosko, U.S. political editor for the Daily Mail on “The Kelly File” [Press Secretary Josh Earnest defended keeping secret a 500-guest White House concert featuring Prince and Stevie Wonder, saying the event was a personal affair for the Obamas and “not part of the responsibilities of the president and first lady.”] Dems beat war drums on trade - President Obama’s defenders dished back to Hillary Clinton a day after the candidate told the president he “should listen to and work with his allies in Congress who rejected his bid for trade authority and if he can’t get a better deal, “there should be no deal."" In a remarkably timely CNN article on Clinton’s waffling and how she wants to “take the lemons and turn it into lemonade,"" Jake Tapper writes, “ But as members of the Obama administration can attest, Clinton was one of the leading drivers of the TPP when Secretary of State. Here are 45 instances when she approvingly invoked the trade bill about which she is now expressing concerns.” “[S]he called the TPP, she said it was going to be the gold standard for trade agreements, so this is very, very freighted for her. This is difficult terrain to navigate because she owned this to some degree and now she has to try navigate through it. So it's going to be challenging for her. – former Obama adviser David Axelrod on MSNBC. Bernie ‘stunned’ by huge crowds - NPR reports that Clinton rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is “stunned” at the large crowds he’s drawing. “Sanders takes this — we'll call it ""Bernie-mentum"" — as a sign his message is breaking through….Sanders is…attracting some of the same types of voters who have been drawn in the past to libertarian Republican Ron Paul and 2004 Democratic candidate Howard Dean. But to some observers like Des Moines-based Democratic strategist Norm Sterzenbach, the question is whether he'll be able to capitalize on it. ""Will he put the team together that knows how to move those people from event attendees to volunteers, to precinct captains to caucus goers?"" he asked. Sanders has an event scheduled Saturday in Denver, and already more than 3,000 people have registered to attend. Decision time for Webb - AP: “[F]ormer Virginia senator [Jim Webb] said Monday he expects to make a decision on a 2016 Democratic bid by the end of the month….Webb says he’s assessing if he can raise enough money because he doesn’t want to run just ‘a protest campaign.’” [Webb has a pair of events in Iowa today, including a speech to the Des Moines Committee on Foreign Relations.] Banana split time – Fox News Junior Reporter Lauren Blanchard reports from the trail on a Webb campaign scheduling snafu that left some potential caucus-goers with sticky fingers. SOUND OFF: READERS REACT TO THE POWER INDEX “First choice is Scott Walker. He has faced the music in his home state & survived beyond what everyone expected. Once he comes out officially, he'll knock all others off. My second choice is Marco Rubio. He is a natural & a great young face. Only down side is no governorship.” – Julie Mudric “In your GOP Power Index you show Carly Fiorina at No. 4, yet most of the polls show her out of the Top-10. As you can ascertain, I’m a fan, and I think that she would be ideal as a VP…To have a shot, however, she has to be heard and seen, and with FOX’s rules for the first debate, I’m afraid that she won’t make the Top-10 cut against the name brands now in the race.” – Ron Way “I think Bernie Sanders could be like Eugene McCarthy in 1968. He attracts students and the anti-war crowd like McCarthy did. He is going to give Clinton a run for her money.” – Ben Wright LEAVE THE GUN, TAKE THE BACON KETV: “A man arrested on suspicion of burglary over the weekend is accused of only taking two items from a Lincoln home. Police said Justin Morris, 29, was found passed out on the front lawn of a home…Next to him, police said, was a 42-inch flat-screen TV; a package of bacon was found in his pocket. About 12 hours later and two blocks from where Morris was found, a woman reported a burglary at her apartment. The only two items taken were a TV and a pound of Farmland thick-cut bacon. Police said Morris was arrested at his home in connection with the burglary and taken to the Lancaster County Jail.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"Set to classical music, Graham blends, beats, drops, chops and throws an old mobile to death. He lights it on fire. He shreds it in a blender. He drops it off a roof ... you get the idea.","1503","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/23/loud-and-clear-graham-got-message-for-trump.html"
"He ends with the kicker: “If all else fails, you can always give your number to the Donald."" He then says, ""This is for all the veterans,"" and chucks the phone off screen.","1504","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/23/loud-and-clear-graham-got-message-for-trump.html"

"The video is the latest smack in the long-distance spat between Graham and Trump. A day earlier, Trump swiped at Graham by his reading his phone number to supporters at a South Carolina rally.

"Trump’s braggadocio about how he plans to bully Russian President Vladimir Putin and free American hostages held by Iran, even before he is sworn in as president, excites his supporters, but lacks any credible specifics. Perhaps Trump thinks the force of his personality is greater than Russian weaponry or the coming Iranian nuclear bomb. If so, he should not be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office.","1588","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-donald-trumps-political-trajectory-will-end-in-flames.html"
"Trump has tapped into a deep anger among many members of the public who hate Washington and its dysfunction. He rightly lambasts politicians who rarely live up to their promises and especially Republicans for too often surrendering to Democrats, a party to which until fairly recently he belonged. But if he wants to tear down the establishment, he must offer something of substance in its place.","1589","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-donald-trumps-political-trajectory-will-end-in-flames.html"
"Trump is a chameleon, having held contradictory positions on various issues over the years as it suits him. He fits the dictionary.com definition of demagogue: “a person, especially an orator or political leader, who gains power and popularity by arousing the emotions, passions, and prejudices of the people.” That’s Lonesome Rhodes. That’s also Donald Trump.","1590","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-donald-trumps-political-trajectory-will-end-in-flames.html"
"Trump is a serial violator (and he’s not alone in this) of Ronald Reagan’s “11th Commandment,” which states that Republicans are never to speak ill of a fellow Republican. There’s a good reason for this. If Republicans trash Republicans, by the time a nominee is chosen, the party has given Democrats a slew of disparaging sound bites they can use as political ammo in the general election campaign. Not a smart move.","1591","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-donald-trumps-political-trajectory-will-end-in-flames.html"

"The rhetoric between Republican front-runner Donald Trump and Senator Rand Paul, R-Ky., is heating up on the campaign trail ahead of the next GOP debate. At a Saturday rally in Boone, Iowa, Trump blasted Paul as being an “ineffective guy” and weak on immigration and national security issues. He claims Paul is attacking him because his polls numbers remain quite low and he needs media attention. Trump currently stands at nearly 30 percent compared to Paul’s two percent, according to the latest Real Clear Politics average polling. During his speech, Trump blasted critics who say he’s picking fights with his fellow Republicans and pointed to primary voters who prefer his “aggressive tone and tremendous energy."" The latest feud began Thursday when Paul, referring to Trump, said “I don’t really think there’s anything conservative about him and I think he’s selling us a bill of goods. And so I think we need to be very careful that we don’t succumb to celebrity and all of the sudden get a fake conservative that turns out to be a big government Republican.” Later Saturday, Trump again blasted Paul on social media. “Lightweight Senator Rand Paul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him,” said the businessman in a tweet. In another Twitter post, he took a personal dig at Paul, saying he doesn’t compare to his father, former congressman and 2008 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. “I truly understood the appeal of Ron Paul, but his son, Rand Paul, didn't get the right gene,” he said. Since Trump announced his White House run in June, both candidates have spared over policy and personality. Earlier this month, Paul said Trump “is a disaster. I think he will hurt the country and will lose in a land slide.” At a New Hampshire rally in August, Trump told supporters a story about him playing golf with Paul. “So I'm actually a good golfer. I killed him, OK? I killed him. If I didn't, I wouldn't say it, but I killed him.”","Published September 12, 2015","1595","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/12/donald-trump-rand-paul-feud-reaches-new-level.html"

"“It’s a massive, unbelievable competitive advantage,” said Dave Carney, a GOP campaign consultant who was chief strategist for Rick Perry’s 2012 presidential primary campaign. “Having access to a private jet is the single most important asset to any national political campaign.

"The two Trump jets logged at least 71 campaign-related flights between April 1 and Aug. 31, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal Aviation Administration flight records on Flightwise.com and FlightAware.com. The flights included at least 26 stops in airports serving Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, all of them early primary or caucus states.

"Flyovers with his Trump-branded planes, such as a recent one when his 757 circled over a campaign rally at an Alabama stadium, maximize his impact, Mr. Trump said. “We flew over the center of the stadium and the place went wild.

"Here are five observations:","1614","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"1. Credit goes to the moderators for sticking to policy other than a brief detour into Carson’s troubles this past week. A few topics did go overlooked: health care, savings, and the retirement economy; what the two candidates who worked in banks (Jeb Bush and John Kasich) learned from their stints in high finance.","1615","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"2. A tip of the hat to the tech-support team at Fox Business for a glitch-free Internet feed (not everyone gets the FBN, including my cable system here at Stanford University).","1616","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"3. Early in the proceedings, Bush’s missed chance to score big on inclusiveness. Bush noted the impracticality of Trump’s wish to deport 11 million illegal aliens. But he didn’t get the right-the-boat sound bite his struggling candidacy needs (saying a few words en Español would have helped show that Bush is genuinely empathetic, plus it really annoys Trump).","1617","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"4. Marco Rubio deftly defended his proposed increase in the child tax credit. Small wonder: The Wall Street Journal, the debate’s co-sponsor, ripped it back in June. Credit good staff work for anticipating the question – it’s how debates are won or lost.","1618","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"5. Carly Fiorina spent 90 seconds calling for federal zero-based budgeting without explaining it. Coke Zero, most people get. Zero-based budgeting? Too wonky for the low-information crowd. Fiorina’s much better when she keeps it simple – like pointing out that her encounters with Putin aren’t limited to green rooms.","1619","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"But the big takeaway: What happened to Donald Trump? Aside from a swipe at Fiorina for interrupting, he wasn’t his usual bad-boy self.","1620","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"I have a theory that the Trump presidential campaign is a lot like a New York baseball crowd: There are some not-into-it wealthy people who pay a small fortune to arrive late and leave early; others who live and breathe the game; still others who think their ticket entitles them to slur the ballplayers and their maternal ancestry.","1621","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"In the 24 hours culminating with the FBN/WSJ debate, Trump published an op-ed on Chinese monetary policy in the Wall Street Journal, questioned Ben Carson’s integrity, and pretty much kept his temper and ego in check while the cameras rolled.","1622","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"In the last week, he has filed candidacy papers in New Hampshire and hammed it up on ""Saturday Night Live.""","1623","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"

"But in Milwaukee, Trump didn’t go looking for trouble. Maybe it was the low-key line of questioning. Or it could be that after four encounters, Trump’s getting bored with the routine – and even himself.","1626","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"Or, something more frightening for establishment Republicans to ponder: Trump thinks he can win this race and plans to act more like a statesman than a showman.","1627","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"
"Once upon a time in America, Fridays meant ""Fight Night"" on television. Not that Tuesdays have become a substitute. None of Milwaukee’s expected fireworks materialized. Trump didn’t continue with his attacks on Carson’s character. Nor did Bush go after Rubio.","1628","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/10/fourth-gop-debate-what-happened-to-donald-trump.html"

"Experienced political strategists note that winning a general election and winning the Republican nomination are often very different tasks. The GOP's most conservative voters — a group that is older and whiter than the nation as a whole — wield extraordinary influence in picking the nominee.

"New York Times columnist Frank Bruni is scratching his head over Donald Trump’s growing popularity with Evangelical Christians—and for good reason. How does one explain that a candidate like The Donald who has been married three times, runs casinos, discounts the need for asking God’s forgiveness, and has difficulty citing one verse of the Bible is trouncing card-carrying evangelical candidates like Huckabee, Cruz, and others too far down the list to warrant mention?","Published September 08, 2015","1733","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/08/why-trump-is-triumphant-with-evangelicals-for-now.html"

So 1828 proved to be a row with Jackson emerging victorious -- as the first true “outsider” to ever capture the White House, dethroning the Adams dynasty.","1810","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/05/trump-phenomenon-as-old-as-republic.html"

"Tocqueville sensed this fitfulness of the American political system in Chapter 13 of his survey, titled “Why the Americans are So Restless in the Midst of their Prosperity.” In this chapter, Tocqueville writes that in the “Old World,” some inhabitants are “extremely ignorant and poor,” not to mention “frequently oppressed by the government, yet their countenances are generally placid and their spirits light.”","1818","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/05/trump-phenomenon-as-old-as-republic.html"

"Tocqueville argues that in America, “a man builds a house in which to spend his old age, and he sells it before the roof is on; he plants a garden and lets it just (sic) as the trees are coming into bearing; he brings a field into tillage and leaves other men to gather the crops; he embraces a profession and gives it up; he settles in a place, which he soon afterwards leaves to carry his changeable longings elsewhere.”","1820","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/05/trump-phenomenon-as-old-as-republic.html"
"Perhaps this explains why President Obama rode in on a momentous surge of political capital in 2008 -- only to see it liquidated at an alarming rate in less than two years.

"Now Donald Trump speaks about problems with immigration. The Senate approved a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform bill two years ago.

"The New York Times Magazine has just posted its profile by Mark Leibovich, the author of “This Town.” And he begins with an extensive mea culpa:","1839","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"“Initially, I dismissed him as a nativist clown, a chief perpetrator of the false notion that President Obama was not born in the United States — the ‘birther’ movement. And I was, of course, way too incredibly serious and high-­minded to ever sully myself by getting so close to Donald Trump.","1840","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"“I initially doubted that he would even run. I assumed that his serial and public flirtations with the idea over several election cycles were just another facet of his existential publicity sustenance. I figured that even if Trump did run, his conspiracy-­mongering, reality-­show orientations and garish tabloid sensibilities would make him unacceptable to the polite company of American politics and mainstream media. It would render him a fringe player. So I decided not to write about him, and I felt proud and honorable about my decision.”","1841","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"A good confession by Leibovich, who seemed charmed by the generous access after negotiating with Hillary Clinton’s staff over, for example, whether any depiction of her campaign office itself would be off the record.","1842","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"Unlike overly programmed politicians, he writes, “Trump understands and appreciates that reporters like to be given the time of day. It’s symbiotic in his case because he does in fact pay obsessive attention to what is said and written and tweeted about him. Trump is always saying that so-and-so TV pundit ‘spoke very nicely’ about him on some morning show and that some other writer ‘who used to kill me’ has now come around to ‘loving me.’’’","1843","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"This is an important point: Journalists not only love that Trump is available, but that he knows how to stir the pot and make news—even at the risk that he will rip them afterward. There are few things more frustrating than landing an interview with a presidential candidate and getting the same canned sound bites we’ve all heard before.","1844","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"

"“He kept flipping between Fox News, CNN and MSNBC, sampling the commentary in tiny snippets. Whenever a new talking head came on screen, Trump offered a scouting report based on the overriding factor of how he or she had treated him. ‘This guy’s been great to me,’ he said when Bill O’Reilly of Fox appeared (less so O’Reilly’s guest, Brit Hume, also of Fox). Kevin Madden of CNN, a Republican strategist, was a ‘pure Romney guy,’ while Ana Navarro, a Republican media consultant and Jeb Bush supporter, was ‘so bad, so pathetic, awful — I don’t know why she’s on television.’ Click to Fox News. Jeb Bush was saying something in Spanish. Click to MSNBC. Hillary Clinton was saying she wished Trump would start ‘respecting women’ rather than ‘cherishing women.’ (‘She speaks so poorly, I think she’s in trouble,’ Trump said.) Click to CNN. It showed a graphic reporting that 70 percent of Latinos had a negative view of Trump. Click to Fox News. Trump asked for another plate of au gratin.”","1846","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"The Donald, never unplugged.","1847","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"Another major piece appears in New York Magazine by Frank Rich, the former Times columnist, unabashed liberal and consultant on “Veep” who doesn’t hide his disdain for Trump. He writes, for instance, of “the quest to explain” how “the billionaire’s runaway clown car went into overdrive.”","1848","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"But Rich feels compelled to give Trump his due, even as a flawed messenger: “It’s possible that his buffoonery poses no lasting danger. Quite the contrary: His unexpected monopoly of center stage may well be the best thing to happen to our politics since the arrival of Barack Obama.”","1849","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"Trump, he argues, “has performed a public service by exposing, however crudely and at times inadvertently, the posturings of both the Republicans and the Democrats and the foolishness and obsolescence of much of the political culture they share. He is, as many say, making a mockery of the entire political process with his bull-in-a-china-shop antics. But the mockery in this case may be overdue, highly warranted, and ultimately a spur to reform…By calling attention to that sorry state of affairs 24/7, Trump’s impersonation of a crypto-fascist clown is delivering the most persuasively bipartisan message of 2016.”","1850","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"While allowing that Trump commits heresy on such matters as taxing hedge-fund guys, Rich ultimately blames the Republican culture: “On the matters of race, women, and immigration that threaten the GOP’s future viability in nonwhite, non-male America, he is at one with his party’s base. What he does so rudely is call the GOP’s bluff by saying loudly, unambiguously, and repeatedly the ugly things that other Republican politicians try to camouflage in innuendo, focus-group-tested euphemisms, and consultantspeak.”","1851","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"This is the last line of defense for the anti-Trump contingent: The problem is not The Donald, it’s the way he caters to the dark passions of conservative Republicans. But many Democrats are also fed up with politics as usual, which is why socialist Bernie Sanders has improbably pulled close to Hillary in the polls.","1852","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"
"With his new tax-cut proposal, Trump has kicked off the second phase of his campaign, one in which he’s offering policy as well as persona. Asked by Matt Lauer yesterday what he would do if his poll numbers sink, Trump said: ""If I think for some reason it's not going to work, then I'd go back to my business."" But there's no indication he's going anywhere for the foreseeable future.","1853","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/30/taking-on-trump-elite-media-are-now-trying-to-decipher-donald.html"

"The third quarter report showed that Trump raised $3.9 million over the period between June 30 through Sept. 30. Of that, $2.8 million came from individual donations of $200 or less. In addition, he's put up about $1.9 million of his own money, in loans and contributions, since officially launching his bid in mid-June.","1861","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/trump-lean-machine-raises-3m-spends-less-than-competitors.html"

"“There is a general perception that he has all the money he needs,” however, “he’s spending less -- he hasn’t had to open his wallet – because of all the attention he’s received,” said Anthony Corrado, professor and campaign finance expert at Colby College in Maine. “His standing in the polls has allowed him to essentially ride this wave of support.”","1864","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/trump-lean-machine-raises-3m-spends-less-than-competitors.html"
"While Trump is not doing high-dollar fundraising events like other candidates, his website solicits donations all the way up to the individual limit of $2,700. Much of his financial support is coming in this way, and appears to be going a long way as Trump spends (and raises) far less than his competitors.","1865","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/trump-lean-machine-raises-3m-spends-less-than-competitors.html"

"Trump told Fox News this week that he only spent “a couple of million” on his campaign so far, and “zero” on advertising due to all the free air time he has received. “I’ve spent the least money and I’ve got the best poll numbers.

"As the campaign draws closer to the early 2016 primary contests, however, Trump will need to spend more money, Corrado said. “We will start to see this change in the fourth quarter,” he said, pointing to Trump’s announcement that he plans to spend upwards of $20 million in the next phase of his campaign on advertising.","1873","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/trump-lean-machine-raises-3m-spends-less-than-competitors.html"
"So far, ""his expenditures are revolving around his travel, spending the money to put on viable campaign events, gathering intelligence in the early primary states"" and promoting his brand, said Corrado. ""It reflects a grassroots approach to campaigning ... Therefore he has been able to conserve his resources to spend more as they get closer to the actual voting.""","1874","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/trump-lean-machine-raises-3m-spends-less-than-competitors.html"

"When Hewitt asked Trump whether he was familiar with the leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic State, Trump replied that he was unconcerned by the leaders of these militant Islamic groups, claiming that many would not remain in power by the time he was elected president, and that he would recruit experts to advise him in office. “I’ll have, I’m a delegator,” he said.","2012","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/11/trump-to-showcase-foreign-policy-in-speech-during-ukraine-conference.html"
"Trump also appeared unable to distinguish between the anti-Israeli militant Palestinian group in Gaza, Hamas, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist group, and Hezbollah, the Shiite group that effectively controls much of Lebanon and parts of Syria. Asked when he would learn the difference, Trump replied “when it’s appropriate.”","2013","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/11/trump-to-showcase-foreign-policy-in-speech-during-ukraine-conference.html"

"The conference in Kiev, known colloquially as a kind of ""Davos East,"" a reference to the influential annual gathering of comparable officials and diplomats in Switzerland, has more participants this year than ever before, but relatively few high-level Americans. Two years ago when the meeting was held in Yalta, the conference’s featured speakers included Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as former CIA director David Petraeus, who is participating again this year. Hillary Clinton, her party’s front-runner for the presidential nomination, will not be participating. She had already resigned as Obama's secretary of state two years ago when she spoke here of America's strong support for Ukraine. At this Friday’s evening’s session, Bill Clinton is scheduled to send a message of support via satellite.","2015","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/11/trump-to-showcase-foreign-policy-in-speech-during-ukraine-conference.html"

A new poll shows Trump with over 30 percent of those polled for the first time. Pinchuk said that he also wanted to ensure that the gathering would hear from prominent Republicans and Democrats. Finally, he said, Trump has already made several recent statements about Russia and Ukraine that he hoped he would clarify and expand on.

"Bush did accuse Trump of giving him money as governor of Florida in an unsuccessful attempt to win casino gambling in the state. Trump dismissed that as “totally false,” but the moment would have been worse for him had CNN done a quick fact check: Trump held a fundraiser for Bush in his 1998 campaign and donated $50,000 to the Florida Republican Party but was not able to get his casino project approved.","2033","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/16/debate-trump-counterpunches-well-but-carly-gets-in-his-well-face.html"

She generally used a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, but didn’t hold back when Trump ripped her record as the fired CEO of Hewlett-Packard.

"The other notable exchange involved Jeb’s brother, and he didn’t handle it well.

"My scorecard for the Reagan Library faceoff: Carly Fiorina helped herself the most with a strong and sometimes emotional performance and by effectively challenging Trump.

"It hasn’t been a great few days for Donald Trump. And it doesn’t seem to matter. The media refs are really savaging him after a couple of misstatements and missteps, even as they struggle to understand why he pays no penalty when they blow the whistle. What they don’t quite grasp is that their attacks only make him stronger. This is not to let him off the hook for mistakes, just to recognize that Trump has completely rewritten the rule book, infuriating those who thought they enforced the rules. What’s more, some of the media attacks against the Republican front-runner are so virulent that they overshoot the mark, and possibly even backfire. We have the New York Times editorial page accusing him of “racist lies.” We have the Washington Post editorial page calling him a demagogue running a campaign of “growing ugliness” and declaring: “The only way to beat a bully is to stand up to him.” And it’s hard to imagine the Post running this column headline about almost anyone else: “Donald Trump’s Rally Carries Echo of Hitler’s Rise to Power.” A Trump adviser tells me that the mainstream media, Republican elite and Washington establishment—lumping them all together—will do anything they can to take down his boss. And the people who like Trump, in this adviser’s view, instinctively believe the media don’t treat people fairly. Trump isn’t exactly meticulous when it comes to fact-checking. No one has been able to confirm his recollection that he saw, on television, thousands of people in New Jersey cheering when the twin towers came down. But after the Washington Post’s fact-checker gave Trump’s claim four Pinnochios, he found a small measure of vindication in a 2001article in that very paper that said: “Law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.” A “number of people” is not thousands, but Trump proudly quoted the piece at a rally. The mainstream media, as Trump’s camp sees it, don't want to report that some people across the country were happy about the devastation of 9/11. Trump also stumbled by retweeting some racial murder statistics that turned out to be bogus and wildly inaccurate. When Bill O’Reilly chided him for that, Trump said, “Am I going to check every statistic?” The press has finally learned, after repeatedly being burned, not to seize upon controversial or questionable comments to predict Trump’s demise. So there is an anguished search for larger explanations: His supporters don’t care if he tells the truth, he symbolizes the modern-day GOP, and on and on. This comes from all sides, with conservative commentators who fear he’s hijacked the party even harsher on Trump than liberal ones. But here’s the thing: Trump projects strength, and part of that is not backing down, even when it’s obvious he has misspoken. In the wake of the Paris attacks, he’s going up in the polls, while Ben Carson is slipping. Trump leads nationally. He leads in Iowa, even with Ted Cruz surging. He has a huge lead in New Hampshire. A big lead in South Carolina. A huge lead in Florida. And that is driving the pundits crazy. So let’s look at this latest media wave. Here’s that New York Times editorial: “America has just lived through another presidential campaign week dominated by Donald Trump’s racist lies… “Mr. Trump has distinguished himself as fastest to dive to the bottom. If it’s a lie too vile to utter aloud, count on Mr. Trump to say it, often. It wins him airtime, and retweets through the roof.” And here’s a NYT news story: “No one ever expected Mr. Trump to turn himself into the issues expert of the Republican presidential field. Yet the verbal shortcuts and salesmanlike stretches that he has relied on for months — generalities used to dodge questions, and questionable recollections — are tripping him up as the tenor of the campaign has grown more serious.” Salon blames the press for letting Trump get away with untrue statements: “The mainstream political media has such a pathological dedication to the notion of balance and ‘objectivity’ that it often finds itself at a complete loss when it comes to dealing with someone like Trump. But the kind of filth that he and others are putting out has long since moved past the debatable stage. There is an Islamophobic crisis building in this country.” It’s not hard to imagine Washington Post columnist Chris Cillizza wringing his hands as he writes: “In elections and campaigns past, there would have been a price to pay for The Donald's complete flouting of fact. It would have hurt him politically to just say things that aren't true.” The reason, he says, is that “trust in the media — in both parties but especially among conservatives who comprise Trump's base — is at an all-time low. So, anything that a member of the media calls a ‘fact’ is inherently viewed as fishy (at best) by the people backing Trump. The media lies, we all know that, so why wouldn't they lie about this, too? All the mainstream media cares about is serving as the political correctness police, so if this did happen then of course they would work to cover it up, right?” I think Cillizza nails it. And those of us in the media have no one to blame but ourselves. Donald Trump didn’t cause our slide in credibility, even as he feasts off it. And we’ll still be working on earning back trust long after this campaign has faded into history.","Published November 25, 2015","2055","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/25/media-escalate-attacks-over-trump-stumbles-but-remains-impervious.html"

"Trump received the most applause for his position on illegal immigration, which many voters in the crowd say the federal government is handling poorly. “It’s a massive problem we have to stop illegal immigration,” he explained. “It’s disgusting what is happening to our country, we are a dumping ground for the rest of the world.”","2080","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/14/trump-riles-up-conservative-crowd-over-illegal-immigration-sanctuary-cities.html"
"The crowd erupted when Trump went on the attack over sanctuary cities, in particular, the murder of Kate Steinle allegedly by an illegal immigrant, Francisco Sanchez. “Kate in San Francisco - this magnificent young woman shot in the back by a guy that was sent over here, probably pushed over, who knows but it was an illegal immigrant came over went to San Francisco - we have to end this sanctuary cities.”","2081","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/14/trump-riles-up-conservative-crowd-over-illegal-immigration-sanctuary-cities.html"

"Donald Trump’s criticism of Jeb Bush’s brother over the 9/11 attacks is resonating strongly with one group:","Published October 21, 2015","2113","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"Liberals.","2114","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"They are more than happy to seize the moment and blame George W. Bush for the worst terrorist attack in our nation’s history.","2115","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"Take MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, who is pumped up over the Trump offensive: “The Democrats never had the stones to go out and challenge George W… because they probably felt that would be un-nice. Trump isn’t un-nice, he’s willing to be tough.”","2116","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"Brad Woodhouse, a former Democratic Party spokesman, sent out an email saying “Trump is right about 9/11.” That linked to a liberal piece in the Atlantic with the same headline.","2117","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"Any fair review of what happened would conclude that the Clinton and Bush administrations shared responsibility for the attacks that claimed the lives of 3,000 Americans. The intelligence failures over the al-Qaeda plot, which had been in the works for years, certainly predate Bush, who had only been in office for eight months. But it’s also true that the classified presidential daily briefing on Aug. 6, 2001 warned Bush: “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.”—and there were other warnings as well.","2118","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"In pure political terms, Trump has shifted the campaign conversation in a way that hurts Jeb. The more time that Jeb spends talking about 2001, the less time he spends talking about the future. And the more time he spends defending his brother, the more he reminds voters that he is the third Bush to seek the White House—which undermines Jeb’s “I’m my own man” theme.","2119","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"This has become a Trump specialty, to jab at his rivals with a provocative comment that forces them to spend days counterpunching.","2120","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"The contretemps began with a television interview on Bloomberg, when Trump said this about the 43rd president: “I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time.” When anchor Stephanie Ruehl objected, Trump said people could blame Bush or not, but this was a fact: “The World Trade Center came down during his reign.” That prompted Jeb to tweet that the billionaire’s comments were “pathetic.”","2121","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"Since the Trump line contradicts Jeb’s narrative that his brother “kept us safe,” Bush stepped it up on CNN’s “State of the Union,” saying Trump is not serious when it comes to foreign policy: “Does anybody actually blame my brother for the attacks on 9/11? If they do, they’re totally marginalized in our society.”","2122","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"But nobody this side of the conspiracy nuts is blaming George Bush for the attacks; some are saying (which was widely reported in the following years, though little remembered now) that his administration missed important signals and that law-enforcement and intelligence agencies failed to share information.","2123","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"Trump elaborated Monday’s on “Fox & Friends” and Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day,” saying his tougher approach to immigration might have kept most of the hijackers out of the country. (This is debatable, as most of them had valid student and tourist visas.)","2124","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"And the new focus on what was dubbed the War on Terror enabled Trump to pivot to Iraq, saying on CNN it was “just a disastrous decision” for the former president to launch that invasion and destabilize the Middle East.","2125","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"Trump also told anchor Alisyn Camerota that “they knew an attack was coming. George Tenet, the CIA director, knew in advance there would be an attack, and he said so.”","2126","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"It sounded at first glance like Trump might be wading into murky waters, but the key phrase is “an attack.” Tenet was indeed worried about an al-Qaeda attack—he insisted on a meeting with Condi Rice to press the point—but he didn’t know when and where, or that planes would be hijacked.","2127","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"While liberals are jumping on this Trump bandwagon, some conservatives are upset. Fox’s Dana Perino, Bush’s former press secretary, accused Trump of peddling “liberal conspiracy theories.”","2128","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, a major detractor, ran a piece titled “Trump’s 9/11 Truthing.” The headline is unfair because truthers are those who say the Bush administration was complicit in the attacks.","2129","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"“Mr. Trump is now trying to blunt that rebuke by distorting the truth about the hijackers and the Osama bin Laden era…Blaming George W. Bush for the 9/11 attacks is like blaming President Obama for the recession that followed the 2008 financial panic,” the Journal says. “The rise of al Qaeda had been going on for years, and its first attack on U.S. soil was its bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.”","2130","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"National Review, which is hostile to The Donald, published a column yesterday in which Jeb said Trump “echoes the attacks of Michael Moore and the fringe Left against my brother is yet another example of his dangerous views on national-security issues…","2131","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"“Donald Trump simply doesn’t know what he’s talking about. And his bluster overcompensates for a shocking lack of knowledge on the complex national-security challenges that will confront the next president of the United States.” ‎ Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but Mike Murphy, an 18-year Jeb adviser who runs his Super PAC, broke a long period of media silence by calling Trump “a false zombie front-runner. He’s dead politically, he'll never be president of the United States, ever. By definition I don't think you can be a front-runner if you're totally un-electable,” Murphy told Bloomberg.","2132","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"So Jeb World is fully engaged. And since Bush’s interviews tend not to generate much news, maybe this has brought him more media attention than he’s gotten in weeks.","2133","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"
"But he’s playing very much on Trump’s turf, and that has hurt. In the latest CNN poll, Trump hit 27 percent, and Bush is at 8—numbers that, however early, Jeb needs to find a way to change.","2134","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/21/trumps-11-sparring-with-bush-left-piles-on-jebs-brother.html"

"The first GOP was marked by fireworks, but those fireworks mostly fizzled by Round Two. CNN did its best to pit the candidates against one another – and especially against Trump – but even The Donald set aside a lot of his signature bombast. He even high-fived and back-slapped his neighbors, who appreciated it – at least some of the time.","Published September 17, 2015","2175","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/trump-debate-forty-four-percent-cnn-debate-questions-focus-on-donald.html"
"The more than three-hour battle, following the undercard contest, became what CNN analyst David Axelrod called the “iron constitution” debate. Sen. Marco Rubio looked especially strong on foreign policy, saying we don’t put our military in the position to do “pinprick attacks,” he would put them in a position to “win.”","2176","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/trump-debate-forty-four-percent-cnn-debate-questions-focus-on-donald.html"
"Former CEO Carly Fiorina continued her rise, attacking both Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. She even mocked Clinton’s resume, noting that she had also flown around the world a great deal, but also understands that, “flying is an activity, not an accomplishment.”","2177","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/trump-debate-forty-four-percent-cnn-debate-questions-focus-on-donald.html"
"Fiorina struck early and moved ahead of the pack.

"By any reasonable measure the first two were the winners and D.C. establishment types watched as the Bush family continued its fade -- ironically at the Reagan Library.

"While Trump was still Trump, he has mellowed from the first debate and took much of the air out of the room by doing so. None of the candidates failed, but that might not be enough. Former Gov. Jeb Bush failed to move the needle while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Ohio Gov. John Kasich were lost in the noise. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s gentle approach won social conservative hearts, but he failed to break through.","2181","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/trump-debate-forty-four-percent-cnn-debate-questions-focus-on-donald.html"
"That didn’t stop the debate from dwelling mostly on Trump. In a world filled with terrorism, refugee problems, immigration problems, Planned Parenthood funding and more, questions about Trump dominated. Thirty-two of the 73 questions referenced Trump in some way. Often candidates were either answering questions about what Trump had said instead of their own policy views. More than halfway through the debate, the tally was running 50-50 in the tally of Trump vs. non-Trump questions.","2182","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/trump-debate-forty-four-percent-cnn-debate-questions-focus-on-donald.html"
"Debate moderator Jake Tapper even asked Trump about Trump on several occasions: “President Obama’s incoming top general says: ‘Russia represents the greatest threat to national security.’ Mr. Trump you say you can do business with President Vladimir Putin, you say you will get along ‘very well.’”","2183","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/trump-debate-forty-four-percent-cnn-debate-questions-focus-on-donald.html"
"The same went for other candidates. Tapper asked former Gov. Mike Huckabee about hiking the taxes for hedge fund managers: “Do you agree with what Donald Trump and Gov.

"The moderators, including CNN’s Dana Bash and Salem radio talker Hugh Hewitt, tried to pit the candidates against one another, but failed to generate the drama of Round One.

"At one point, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie complained about what he called a “childish back-and-forth” between Fiorina and Trump. It was part of the kinder, gentler Christie that few had seen before. Ben Carson showed why he is scoring high on likability. At the end of his introductory statement, he welcomed Carly Fiorina to the stage.

"Tapper started both debates talking about what his network always talks about – Trump. The same network that devoted 78 percent of its news coverage to Trump, started out talking Trump in the undercard, as well.

Graham, who seemed to have recovered the energy missing in the previous debate, scored the first genuine laugh line of the night joking to Rick Santorum that for the sake of Social Security, we needed population growth. “Strom Thurmond had four kids after he was 67. If you’re not willing to do that, we better come up with a new legal immigration system.” Not to be outdone, Santorum reminded the crowd, “I have seven kids, I’ve done my part.” Graham also vowed that “the first thing I’m going to do as president, we’re going to drink more.”","2219","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/trump-debate-forty-four-percent-cnn-debate-questions-focus-on-donald.html"
"Liberal SiriusXM Insight host Abby Huntsman gave the win to Graham. “If the winner of the kiddie table gets a slot at the adult table, Graham won that seat tonight.” Republican strategist Kevin Madden also credited Graham’s focus on foreign policy as driving the debate. But based on the post-debate scrum, Jindal’s solid social conservative positions earned him solid points with both media and voters.","2220","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/trump-debate-forty-four-percent-cnn-debate-questions-focus-on-donald.html"

"TRUMP’S LOCKED AND LOADED When Donald Trump delivers a speech on national security from the deck of a WWII era battleship on the Los Angeles waterfront today his message to rivals ahead of tomorrow’s debate is clear: If attacked, I’ve got broadsides loaded, ready to fire. Riding a wave of polls, the Republican frontrunner knows his target profile is high and that critics say foreign policy is a chink in his armor. So in typical Trump fashion, he’s none-to-subtly saying, bring it. The address aboard the USS Iowa before a conservative veterans group – which will reportedly focus on international challenges and veterans’ issues – gives Trump the opportunity to dispel questions over his knowledge of foreign affairs and strengthen his standing with the military community, which took a hit early on in his campaign over dismissive remarks about Sen. John McCain’s service record. Whether Trump, who has said he’d solve veterans’ health care issues by “firing everyone at the VA” will offer policy specifics is unclear. One thing is clear: while the GOP field seeks to claim the Reagan mantle, Trump’s spectacle will convey an image of strength to a candidate with no military background, just hours before he takes center stage at the former president’s library. [Watch Fox: Chief Political Correspondent Campaign Carl Cameron reports on Trumps speech from the Los Angeles waterfront] And he’s is here to stay, or so he says - The Hill: “Trump had a message to his critics at a massive, sold-out rally in Dallas on Monday…‘I’m not going anywhere and we’re not going anywhere,’ Trump told a packed American Airlines Center, where an estimated 20,000 rallied. ‘We are killing it. They mentioned a little while ago about the silent majority — it’s back. And it’s not silent. Maybe we should call it the noisy, aggressive, wanting to win — wanting-to-win majority.’” But still no details - Time: “The closest Trump got to discussing policy was when he said, ‘We’ve got to lower taxes for a lot of people. Corporations are paying far too much, middle income people are being decimated.’ He said he would announce a ‘great tax plan’ within the next few weeks.” Club for Growth thwacks Trump in Iowa - In two visceral attack ads, the political arm of the conservative group Club for Growth targets Donald Trump as “the worst Republican candidate on economic issues” according to their president David McIntosh. The ads will run in Iowa on all platforms including broadcast, cable, satellite television as well as on digital media. The total ad buy exceeds $1 million.","2285","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/15/trumps-locked-and-loaded.html"
"Poll: Carson closes in on Trump - CBS News: “At 27 percent nationally, Donald Trump maintains his frontrunner status among Republican primary voters, but Ben Carson is now close behind him, a new CBS News/New York Times poll finds. Carson’s support has risen significantly since early August, from 6 percent then, to 23 percent now, putting him in second place…. Trump has a slight edge among the most conservative voters, while the race is close among women and Tea Party supporters. Trump holds a larger lead among men and evangelical voters. And while Trump leads Carson among voters who have not graduated from college, 30 percent to 19 percent, among college graduates, Carson has 29 percent to Trump's 21 percent. Walker tweaks reboot amid talk of staff moves - Wash Ex: “…The governor’s team said it has decided to redouble its efforts in the early primary states and will focus on detailing his specific policy proposals. Ed Goeas, a Walker senior adviser and veteran Republican pollster, said he has not heard any talk about bringing in the super PAC’s advisers, and added that the campaign is instead focused on its ‘organizational muscle’ in early nominating states.”","2286","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/15/trumps-locked-and-loaded.html"
"[Ambassador John Bolton replaces Walker at the California Republican Party Fall Convention this Saturday.

But now, obviously I’m introducing myself as a real contender in the top tier.” [Taking criticism from Donald Trump and turning it into a positive spin, Fiorina’s PAC released a web ad featuring all types of women. Fiorina says, “look at all of your faces – the face of leadership.”] Jeb PAC potentially could spend highest TV ad campaign in political history - Boston Globe: “The super PAC supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush plans to begin airing what could be the most expensive television advertising campaign in the history of presidential primary politics. On Tuesday, Right to Rise, will begin airing $1.2 million worth of ads on Boston, New Hampshire, and cable stations. A digital campaign and radio advertising will also begin in days.

Bush didn’t need an exclamation point next to his name to connote excitement…he was very good at retail politics and at relating to average voters — the exact opposite of Jeb, who is having trouble exciting them.” Rubio rumbles in ‘MNF’ vid - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., highlighted his college athlete days with a web video that features the Florida senator catching footballs and answering questions. Rubio also poked fun at his water bottle moment from the State of the Union response a few years back saying when prepping for a big game or big speech “make sure there is water nearby, like right now” catching a bottle of water that’s tossed to him. Top Romney advisor joins Rubio team - WaPo: “Lanhee Chen, one of the Republican Party’s most sought-after policy experts, said Monday he has signed on to Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign and will counsel the Florida senator on issues foreign and domestic. As policy director on Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, Chen was the GOP’s nominee’s chief policy adviser and a senior strategist.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… As fall rolls around and the breeze changes from a cozy greeting to a chilly whisper, many people turn to hearty comfort foods like a warm bowl of tomato basil soup with a toasty grilled cheese made from…pigs?

From [one pound] of cheese that was produced, a part of it was sold to an anonymous buyer who said that the cheese tasted ‘chalky and a little bit salty.’ This exclusive cheese was sold for a whooping price of $2,300 per [pound].” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

"BAIER TRACKS: BERNIE PLAN COULD BERN THE ECONOMY… “More and more Democrat voters are ‘Feeling the Bern’ lately, expressing support for the surging Senator Bernie Sanders. He’s seeing huge crowds in early primary and caucus states and even got a warm reception Monday at conservative Liberty University. Most of the stories about Sanders explore the groundswell of support for the independent socialist senator who wants to be the Democrats’ nominee. But this piece in the WSJ explores the actual cost of the policies that Sanders is proposing on the trail. This is an eye opener! 18 trillion dollars in new spending. Trillion with a T. Remember that the country faces a national debt that has surpassed 18 trillion dollars and is currently climbing quickly to 20 trillion dollars. At 24 trillion – many experts believe the country starts to crater from the debt burden. If interest rates increase one percentage point today – the country will be paying more for interest on the national debt than we spend on the Pentagon budget. We could continue to roll out the stats. For Bluedog Democrats – the fiscally conservative Democrats – a shrinking breed in Congress, those numbers are scary. But, now ‘Feeling the Bern’ is the flavor of the moment for Democrats – we’ll see if ‘Seeing the Price tag’ affects that momentum at all” - Bret Baier. Bernie says we need to talk to those with differing views - WSJ: “When [Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.] of Vermont–the least religious state in the U.S.–spoke [at Liberty University] on Monday, a few of his supporters were in attendance…The candidate began by emphasizing his support for gay rights and said he is pro-choice. Then he said: ‘I believe from the bottom of my heart that it is vitally important for those of us who hold different views to be able to engage in a civil discourse.’” Hillary emails show five-month gap - Daily Caller: “Five months’ worth of messages are missing from the emails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton returned to the government, according to documents newly obtained by the watchdog group Judicial Watch. ‘A five month email gap,’ Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said at the non-profit group’s inaugural Leadership Summit Monday. ‘I want an explanation about that.’ Some of the gaps were as long as a month or more, Fitton said.” Hillary: Bubba as VP has ‘crossed my mind’ - Hillary Clinton sat down with “Extra” in an interview Monday on a wide range of topics from Kim Kardashian to her husband Bill. The former secretary of state said the idea of her husband as Vice President has “crossed my mind” but unfortunately, she points out, under the constitution he would not be eligible to succeed her if necessary. DEMS SEEK TO EXPAND SUPER PAC ROLE NYT: “The plans, laid out by the [Democratic party’s] top election lawyers in an emergency request filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, would pave the way for the creation of a host of new super PACs tailored to individual House and Senate candidates. But the filing also suggests that Democrats would, if allowed, seek to use tactics pioneered by Republican presidential candidates this cycle, helping prospective candidates establish and raise money for super PACs before they officially declare their intent to run.”","2289","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/15/trumps-locked-and-loaded.html"

"Earlier this month, Carson was the only 2016 candidate deemed honest and trustworthy by a majority of voters: 60 percent said he was (November 1-3, 2015).

"The attacks seem to have pushed Carson’s honesty ratings down: today 53 percent of all voters say he is honest, while 34 percent say he isn’t. Still, that’s a net positive of 19 points, which gives him the second highest honesty score (the total percentage points of those saying you’re honest minus those saying you’re not) of the candidates included in the poll.","2411","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/22/fox-news-poll-trump-gains-carson-slips-cruz-and-rubio-climb-in-gop-race.html"

"Trump gets a negative 14 honesty score (41 percent honest vs. 55 percent not). That still puts him ahead of Hillary Clinton.

"The problem is that they are strictly judging Trump on his positions, past and present, and pronouncing him insufficiently conservative. But The Donald is not running as a movement conservative. His populist approach draws elements from the right, center and left. Of course he’s going to flunk any litmus test.","2427","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"And what the pundits are slowly learning is that his fans don’t have to agree with him on every single pronouncement and aren’t concerned about past changes of position. They are drawn to his blunt talk and successful business career. And when the media attack him over this or that incident, it seems only to make him stronger.","2428","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"When I interviewed Trump a couple of months ago, I told him I thought he was sending a message of tolerance by making only mild comments about the Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage. He didn’t dispute that, while saying he would have preferred the issue be left to the states. Some GOP candidates who treated that as a hot-button issue, led by Mike Huckabee, are now vehemently defending the Kentucky county clerk who was jailed rather than issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Trump’s response? “We are a nation of laws.”","2429","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"Perhaps the most passionate cry on the right now comes from Jonah Goldberg, the National Review editor-at-large who blames Trump’s supporters for betraying the conservative cause:","2430","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"“And when I say ‘the people’ I don’t mean ‘those people.’ I mean my people. I mean many of you, Dear Readers. Normally, when conservatives talk about how the public can be wrong, we mean that public. You know the one. The ‘low-information voters’ Rush Limbaugh is always talking about.

"“We laugh at liberals who let know-nothing celebrities do their thinking for them. Well, many of the same people we laughed at are now laughing at us because we are going ga-ga over our own celebrity.”Jonah concedes he’s upset: “If I sound dismayed, it’s only because I am. Conservatives have spent more than 60 years arguing that ideas and character matter. That is the conservative movement I joined and dedicated my professional life to. And now, in a moment of passion, many of my comrades-in-arms are throwing it all away in a fit of pique. Because ‘Trump fights!’… “In the last month, Trump has contemplated a flat tax, the fair tax, maintaining the current progressive tax system, a carried-interest tax, a wealth tax, and doing nothing. His fans respond, ‘That shows he’s a pragmatist!’ No. It shows that he has absolutely no ideological guardrails whatsoever.”","2432","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"But it also might show that many Republican voters don’t fit onto the narrow road that the Beltway types have long assumed. They are willing to tolerate departures from orthodoxy if they believe a candidate is capable of taking the country in the right direction. The party’s intellectual wing sweats the details, but most voters form overall impressions of politicians (and don’t care if one can name all the terrorist leaders).","2433","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"What other Republican could get away with vowing to raise taxes on hedge fund guys?

"Not all high-profile conservatives are instinctively opposed to Trump. Laura Ingraham has said Trump is resonating with the GOP base because he says things “no one else is saying,” that “a lot of white middle class voters feel like they have been left behind” and Trump is “channeling that.”","2435","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"Rush Limbaugh said over the summer that “you've got people on Fox, you have Republican Party establishment types, you've got Republican consultants who are out there now saying things about Trump that will be impossible to walk back. Meaning they're going so overboard in their criticism of Trump right now that if Trump happens to stay in this, and if Trump wins this, these people are not going to be able to just automatically rally, which is what everybody says after the nominee is chosen.”","2436","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"

"“If you are a conservative alarmed at the country’s direction and committed to retaking the White House, you should be concerned about what Trump’s ascendancy is doing to the chances of that happening.","2438","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"“The Democrats’ presumptive candidate is flailing badly. Republicans have an unusually talented field with a good chance of winning back the presidency. Do they really want to be dragged into the swamps — right now, on immigration — that will make that prospect electorally impossible?","2439","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"

"Another influential columnist and Fox News commentator, George Will, likens Trump to a hard-drinking loudmouth:","2441","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"“In every town large enough to have two traffic lights there is a bar at the back of which sits the local Donald Trump, nursing his fifth beer and innumerable delusions. Because the actual Donald Trump is wealthy, he can turn himself into an unprecedentedly and incorrigibly vulgar presidential candidate. It is his right to use his riches as he pleases. His squalid performance and its coarsening of civic life are costs of freedom that an open society must be prepared to pay.","2442","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"“When, however, Trump decided that his next acquisition would be not another casino but the Republican presidential nomination, he tactically and quickly underwent many conversions of convenience (concerning abortion, health care, funding Democrats, etc.). His makeover demonstrates that he is a counterfeit Republican and no conservative.”","2443","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
"But if Trump, a former Democrat, is taking on the GOP establishment and the whole collection of senators and governors with a new way of campaigning, then he’s not counterfeit. He is breaking the mold, and much of the punditocracy just doesn’t like the new model. But if the polls are any indication, many Republican voters do.","2444","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/09/civil-war-why-many-conservative-pundits-are-declaring-war-on-trump.html"
