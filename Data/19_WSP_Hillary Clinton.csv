"On issues large and small, the Democratic presidential contender is increasingly distancing herself from — or even opposing — key policies pushed by Bill Clinton while he was in the White House, from her recent skepticism on free-trade pacts to her full embrace of gay rights.","2","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-is-running-against-parts-of-her-husbands-legacy/2015/04/29/e34778ae-ee79-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"
"The starkest example yet came Wednesday, when Hillary Clinton delivered an impassioned address condemning the “era of incarceration” ushered in during the 1990s in the wake of her husband’s 1994 crime bill — though she never mentioned him or the legislation by name.","3","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-is-running-against-parts-of-her-husbands-legacy/2015/04/29/e34778ae-ee79-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"
"“We have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance,” Clinton told an audience at Columbia University in New York, making references to unrest in Baltimore and elsewhere and elsewhere over actions by police. “And these recent tragedies should galvanize us to come together as a nation to find our balance again.”","4","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-is-running-against-parts-of-her-husbands-legacy/2015/04/29/e34778ae-ee79-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"
"The contrasts between some of Clinton’s positions and those of her husband from 20 years ago show the extent to which Democrats, and the country as a whole, have shifted to the left on a number of key issues. Indeed, Bill Clinton now says that some of his incarceration policies went too far and that he regrets backing a federal law that defined marriage as being between a man and a woman.","5","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-is-running-against-parts-of-her-husbands-legacy/2015/04/29/e34778ae-ee79-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"

"But the differences also illustrate the dicey challenges that Hillary Clinton will face in attempting to both embrace and keep separate from the 42nd president, who remains personally popular but whose 1990s positions on some issues, particularly in the social arena, now feel out of date.","7","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-is-running-against-parts-of-her-husbands-legacy/2015/04/29/e34778ae-ee79-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"
"Bill Clinton won two elections running as a centrist Democrat waging open war with his party’s left flank.

"“Twenty years is a long time,” said Robert Reich, a leading liberal who served as labor secretary in the Clinton administration. “I don’t think she feels in any way bound by policies of a different administration two decades ago, even though she is married to the person who initiated those policies.

"Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore said Clinton was being opportunistic: “As Hillary Clinton continues to flip-flop on the issues, she’s only further proving that she’ll say anything to benefit herself politically, which is why the majority of American people find her to be untrustworthy.”","14","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-is-running-against-parts-of-her-husbands-legacy/2015/04/29/e34778ae-ee79-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"
"Some in the Republican camp have their own problems reckoning with family legacies, however. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush is struggling to calibrate the proper distance from his father and brother as he mulls a 2016 presidential campaign, while Kentucky Sen.

"The 1994 crime bill ushered into law by Bill Clinton came in the wake of the crack cocaine epidemic, building on anti-drug policies implemented during the Ronald Reagan years. The law enacted a broad range of tough-on-crime policies, including three-strikes-and-you’re-out requirements that helped fuel a surge in incarceration.","16","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-is-running-against-parts-of-her-husbands-legacy/2015/04/29/e34778ae-ee79-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"

"Gay rights is another major area where Hillary Clinton has set out very different positions than her husband adopted while in office, adapting to a profound change in public mood. Both Clintons now repudiate the restrictions on gay military service and marriage that Bill Clinton signed into law.","24","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-is-running-against-parts-of-her-husbands-legacy/2015/04/29/e34778ae-ee79-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"

"On trade, candidate Clinton has declined to endorse a pending Asia-Pacific trade deal, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that is opposed by labor groups and which she supported as secretary of state. Critics of the proposed deal claim it would be a repeat of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they blame for a loss of jobs and economic security. Bill Clinton fought his own party to ratify the deal with Canada and Mexico in 1994.","26","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-is-running-against-parts-of-her-husbands-legacy/2015/04/29/e34778ae-ee79-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"

"So far, Clinton has made only vague statements about the most important domestic issues for Democrats, including the push to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

"But the narratives that the Republicans are beginning to tell about Clinton are also divergent — in message and emphasis, in biography and presentation — forcing the party to pick just one course from a menu of possibilities.

"For Bush , the contrast with Clinton is less visceral. Both are personally wealthy, heirs to political dynasties and favorites of their respective party establishments.

"One challenge for Republicans is that Clinton is a tougher target than she was in her polarizing early years on the national stage. As first lady in the 1990s, she was a partisan warrior, leading an unsuccessful fight for universal health care and sparring with the “vast right-wing conspiracy,” as she put it.

"Fiorina said her husband’s mother had been encouraged by doctors to end her pregnancy for health reasons, but she didn’t, because “she was a woman of great courage and great faith.” She reflected, “I have thought often about how different my own life would have been had she made a different choice.”","117","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carly-fiorina-in-iowa-vows-to-keep-throwing-punches-at-hillary-clinton/2015/04/26/b014543e-ec2b-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"
"Fiorina told the crowd about how she started out as the secretary in a nine-person real estate firm, married a former tow-truck driver and worked her way up to being “the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world.” Wearing a sundress with a cardigan — like many of the women in the audience — Fiorina said she begins each day with prayer, which she said helped her overcome breast cancer in 2009 and cope with the death of her 35-year-old stepdaughter, Lori Ann, “to the demons of addiction.”","118","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carly-fiorina-in-iowa-vows-to-keep-throwing-punches-at-hillary-clinton/2015/04/26/b014543e-ec2b-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"
"Fiorina pitched herself as a leader who understands the struggles of small businesses and working-class families.

"And Fiorina wondered aloud why holding public office has become a prerequisite for the presidency. “When did we get used to this notion that only professional politicians could run for office?” she said. “When did we decide that a professional political class was all that we could have? The professional political class has let us down in too many ways.”","120","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carly-fiorina-in-iowa-vows-to-keep-throwing-punches-at-hillary-clinton/2015/04/26/b014543e-ec2b-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html"

"From Franklin — actually, from Franklin’s alter ego, Poor Richard — comes the saying, “He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas.” In foreign policy, as in fundraising, lying down with dogs goes with the territory.

"Foreign interests, like their U.S. counterparts, may give to the Clinton Global Initiative out of the goodness of their hearts and their commitment to the foundation’s many important works.

"Indeed, this was the very reason that the Obama administration and the Senate, weighing her nomination to be secretary of state in 2009, appropriately insisted that donations to the foundation be publicly reported, and that — while existing foreign government donors would be permitted to keep giving at the same levels — new government donors or dramatically stepped-up donations would require approval from State.","202","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sloppiness-and-greed/2015/04/24/e4d53446-eaa9-11e4-aae1-d642717d8afa_story.html"
"But this was always an imperfect solution to a conundrum: how to allow the foundation to continue its unquestionably good programs without creating conflicts of interest for Clinton or the appearance thereof.

"Which brings us to greed, and the Yiddish word chazer. It means “pig ” but has a specific connotation of piggishness and gluttony.

"The low-key rollout — no big rallies or lengthy speeches — will end months of speculation surrounding the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination.

"The idea is to showcase Clinton’s abilities as a problem-solver and crusader for the rights of those struggling to climb into or stay in the middle class.

"Clinton’s human-scale approach is modeled on the listening tour she conducted across New York state at the start of her successful 2000 Senate race.

"“Humility is the order of the day,” Axelrod said. “Last time, they launched as a big juggernaut cloaked in the veil of inevitability and at 20,000 feet. There was a tremendous backlash to that.

"Axelrod added that Clinton must also articulate a message about economic mobility during her launch that’s “compelling and authentic,” rooted in her personal biography. “She needs to project what the cause is that she’s fighting for here and give people a sense of where they fit into that vision,” he said.","267","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-begins-her-entry-into-the-2016-presidential-race/2015/04/10/f5f08ef0-df9c-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html"

"Clinton’s campaign tied itself in knots last week trying to avoid calling her current position on same-sex marriage a shift, in part because O’Malley was saying she had flip-flopped.

"The first phrase speaks to the suspicion that has long hung around the Clintons that they are always working the angles, stretching the limits of how business can be conducted for their own benefit. It seemed clear that Clinton went out of her way to avoid the federal disclosure requirements related to e-mail by never even setting up an official account. That she took it another step and created a ""homebrew"" e-mail system that would give her ""impressive control over limiting access"" is stunning -- at least to me -- given that she (or someone close to her) had to have a sense that this would not look good if it ever came out.","340","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/04/the-hillary-clinton-email-story-just-keeps-getting-worse-for-her/"
"Yes, her allies have maintained that she turned over more than 55,000 pages of e-mails from her time as secretary of state.

"The second phrase makes clear that Hillary, Bill or Chelsea Clinton didn't (a) dream up or (b) set up the e-mail system the former New York senator used as secretary of state.

"Again, at one level that's entirely defensible. This is not your average family; it has a former president and a once-and-future presidential candidate in it. Some level of caution is warranted. Makes sense. At the same time, Clinton is virtually certain to run for president in 2016. She will run on her long and deep record in public life; an ability then for voters to have as complete a picture as possible of how she acted in key moments as secretary of state is critically important. Any attempt to purposely alter that picture by withholding e-mails -- or simply keeping them in a place that makes it harder for people to access them -- is politically problematic.","343","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/04/the-hillary-clinton-email-story-just-keeps-getting-worse-for-her/"

"Clinton plans to launch her campaign via social media and with a video on Sunday articulating her rationale for seeking the White House. She'll then travel to the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa early next week for campaign events, these people said. She is expected to hold mostly small discussion events with voters designed to help the former secretary of state connect with ordinary Americans and listen to their concerns, forgoing the large rallies and traditional announcement speeches of some of her Republican rivals.","406","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Behind the scenes, meanwhile, Clinton's fundraising machine is revving up. Her top bundlers are plotting aggressive outreach to thousands of Democratic donors over the weekend and into next week urging them to immediately send checks and make donations online as soon as the Clinton campaign's Web site goes live.","407","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"

"Clinton's Sunday announcement would come one day before the expected campaign launch of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is planning a major speech to supporters on Monday afternoon at Miami's iconic Freedom Tower. Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) are the only two major Republican candidates who already have officially entered the race.","409","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"For months, Clinton, like many Republican contenders, has been assembling a campaign-in-waiting. Widely considered by Democrats to be the heir apparent to President Obama, Clinton has hired several of Obama's top campaign strategists to work on her 2016 bid and dozens of staffers, including in the early caucus and primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Last week, the Clinton team signed a lease on office space in Brooklyn, N.Y., as her national campaign headquarters.","410","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Ahead of the campaign launch, Clinton released a new epilogue on Friday for ""Hard Choices,"" her State Department memoir that is coming out this month in paperback. The chapter touches on an array of issues, from her relationship with Obama to economic mobility to childhood education. She writes about her desire for every American in the 21st century to have an equal and fair shot at economic success, a theme she has highlighted in her public speeches over the past year.","411","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Clinton ends the epilogue by ruminating about a ""memory quilt"" she received as a gift after her granddaughter's birth: ""I wondered for a moment what a quilt of my own life would look like. . . . There was so much more to do. So many more panels waiting to be filled in. I folded up the quilt and got back to work.”","412","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"

"Using a social media launch for her campaign, rather than a boisterous and celebratory rally, is a deliberate attempt by Clinton and her advisers to avoid the pitfalls that tripped her up in her 2008 presidential campaign, when she was heavily favored at the outset but ultimately defeated by Obama. Clinton suffered from criticism then that she appeared as if she felt entitled to the nomination and often came off as flat and uninspired on the stump in front of large crowds.","414","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"

"That approach is modeled on the listening tour she conducted across New York state at the start of her successful 2000 Senate race. Longtime advisers and allies said Clinton wants to reestablish the connection with voters and regular people she had in that campaign, when she traveled into diners and people’s living rooms and kitchens to listen to their concerns.","416","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Jay Jacobs, a former New York Democratic Party chairman and longtime Clinton friend and supporter, said the 2000 listening tour became “a two-way conversation that impressed voters not by just what she said, but by how intently she listened. I think that’s Hillary. That’s something that has worked before, and it’ll work again.”","417","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"

"“It will be one that really presents Hillary Clinton to the voters as she is known by people who are close to her: as a very warm, genuine, thoughtful, certainly intelligent, regular person,” Jacobs said. “There’s been so much that we’ve seen that seems to create an image, by the press and by others, those who are looking to derail her, but now the voters are going to hear from Hillary and they’re going to see Hillary.”","419","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Within hours of news reports Friday morning that Clinton would launch her campaign this weekend, the Republican National Committee announced an online ad as part of its ""#StopHillary"" campaign to highlight scandals over her use of private e-mail at the State Department and foreign donations to her family's charitable foundation.","420","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"“From the East Wing to the State Department, Hillary Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal and failed liberal policies that no image consultant can erase,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. “Voters want to elect someone they can trust and Hillary's record proves that she cannot be trusted. We must 'Stop Hillary.'”","421","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Clinton's fundraising team is standing by for the launch of her Web site, when the campaign can begin accepting donations online. One priority is creating a robust small-donor network similar to the Obama campaign's vaunted list from his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, and Clinton advisers see her announcement period as a ripe opportunity.","422","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"“We’re going to have to raise as much money as possible,” said one Clinton fundraiser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign’s internal plans. “We’re not going to take it slow. The announcement is a good time to raise money, and we’ll have everyone out there asking people to support her candidacy.”","423","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"

"“All the horses are in the gate just waiting for those gates to open,” said John Morgan, a prominent Florida donor and Clinton fundraiser. “That’s how I describe the fundraising efforts. There’s really nothing to do until the gate opens. But the gate could open Sunday, and it could be the flood gate. The only issue they’ll have is how fast can they raise the money, because the money is pent up. And if they start holding events, the line will be around the block to host an event.”","425","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Clinton's fundraising efforts are being directed by Dennis Cheng, who had been finance director at the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. But the campaign is not expected to give titles to top bundlers or announce a list of finance committee chairs or members, according to Democrats with knowledge of the Clinton strategy.","426","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Clinton’s focus for now will be on raising money just for the primary – with a cap of $2,700 a donor – through Internet appeals. That will free her up to spend time on the trail, talking to voters, rather than wooing wealthy donors at high-priced fundraisers.","427","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"“I don’t think the first thing out of the gate she should be doing is a bunch of big fundraising events,” said one senior party strategist.","428","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"This is a notable contrast to former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who has spent the better part of four months crisscrossing the country holding closed-door finance events for his Right to Rise political action committee and super PAC with tickets costing as much as $100,000 each.","429","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"“I think she’ll be in Iowa eating corn on the cob instead of clinking champagne flutes with donors,” Morgan said. “She can do this much quicker, much more efficiently because she’s not fighting for donors. Rubio, Bush, that whole crowd is in mortal combat for dollars. She’s not. That’s her advantage.”","430","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Without a strong Democratic challenger on the horizon, Clinton does not feel the pressure to match the kind of “shock and awe” fundraising effort that Bush has been undertaking to scare off other Republican hopefuls. “They have the luxury of doing this the right way, and not trying to just see how much money they can hoover up,” the senior party strategist said.","431","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"In fact, Clinton’s team is wary of raising too much money too quickly -- creating a bulging war chest that could play to the inevitability theme she wants to avoid this time around.","432","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"Clinton will not be able to seed her new campaign with a major cash infusion as she did at the start of her 2008 campaign, when she transferred $10 million from her Senate reelection committee. That helped her post a record $36 million haul for her first fundraising quarter. Her 2008 presidential committee is shut down, and her Senate committee has just $158,000 left in reserves.","433","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"But her campaign this time will be able to build on the efforts of Ready for Hillary, an outside group started in 2013 to lay the groundwork for Clinton's campaign, which has held more than 1,000 grass-roots events across all 50 states in the past two years. In the process, the group amassed a donor pool of more than 135,000 people, the vast majority of whom gave contributions of $100 or less, according to super-PAC officials. Ready for Hillary also has cultivated a network of local organizers who could sign on for similar roles with the official campaign.","434","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"That could give Clinton a sizable head start over some of her Republican rivals in building a small-donor operation. Ready for Hillary will not be able to coordinate with Clinton once she announces, but it could share its list of supporters with her campaign through a list swap, campaign finance lawyers said.","435","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"But the group may not even have to take that step. Once Clinton declares her candidacy, the super PAC can simply direct its supporters to her Web site, allowing her campaign to quickly build a small-donor list.","436","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"
"And once she’s officially in, Ready for Hillary plans to post online the names of hundreds of donors who have given or raised more than $5,000, according to a person familiar with the plans. That list — which includes at least 222 donors who gave $25,000 — would be valuable not just for Clinton’s campaign but for Priorities USA, the high-dollar super PAC planning to finance a pro-Clinton television advertising campaign and now faces pressure to kick-start its fundraising.","437","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/"

"But, in terms of raising the ""I don't know if I want to go through all of this again"" sentiment among average people, this collection of stories is just terrible. It reminds them -- or, if it doesn't remind them yet, it will -- of all the things in the 1990s that they didn't like and certainly don't want to go through again.

"After a complicated tenure as first lady, Clinton reinvented herself as a potholes-and-pork senator from her adopted state of New York.

"Perhaps her most significant rebranding came in 2000, when she became a popular elected official in her own right after her husband’s Monica Lewinsky scandal and after a controversial tenure as first lady.

"Clinton’s advisers were divided then about how to bust the caricature of Clinton as remote and brittle.

"Hillary Clinton’s video announcement of her presidential run features Americans who are entering transitional periods in their lives — an expecting mother, a pair of immigrant brothers starting a business, a man changing to a new skilled blue-collar job, a woman running for president (Clinton herself). They discuss the future with a mix of trepidation and self-conscious hopefulness. This includes Clinton; by discussing her own story in similarly personal terms, she seeks to humanize her ambitions and tie them to the ordinary hopes for the future expressed by the “everyday Americans” that precede her in the video.","April 13","494","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"Behind all the sentimentality lies some fairly serious signaling about where Clinton’s campaign is headed and what it will be about.","495","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"Notably, all the people in the video express cautious optimism about the next chapter in their lives. The key here is the tone. Over the weekend, the New York Times reported that Clinton’s advisers, after pondering how to handle GOP efforts to link her to Obama, have concluded that her best bet is not to distance herself from Obama’s record, but to praise the economic progress he has made, and promise a “new chapter” designed to build on it, one focused on giving those “everyday Americans” a better shot at getting ahead.","496","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"That’s because internal Clinton polling shows frustration with Washington gridlock but not necessarily a desire for a wholesale break from Obama’s policies. Public polling has shown a desire for such a break, but Clinton’s pollster, Joel Benenson, is known to put much more stock in his own nuanced, fine-grained research.","497","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"I strongly suspect the Clinton campaign has concluded that Americans are exhausted by the ideological death struggles of the Obama presidency, and that swing voters and independents don’t see the Obama years as quite the smoking apocalyptic hellscape Republicans continue to describe. With the GOP hoping to terrify voters with the prospect of Hillary-as-Obama-third-term, and with the 2016 GOP hopefuls zealously vowing to roll back the Obama presidency, Republicans will likely continue re-litigating how awful the Obama years have supposedly been. The Clinton gamble is that swing voters don’t want to hear this argument anymore; that they agree Obama’s policies have not turned the economy around fast enough, but think this is understandable given the circumstances and don’t see those policies as an utter, abject failure.","498","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"The people in the video, then, are cautiously anticipating that they may well continue progressing, but they are uncertain about how to manage the transitions they face. Clinton, the video tells us, identifies with that uncertainty; she will help restore economic mobility.","499","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"The video contains zero policy specifics. But it contains the seeds of an agenda in the manner in which it defines its subjects’ economic challenges: The woman who is moving house “just” to get her child into a better school; the woman who is pondering how to reenter the job market after five years raising kids; the immigrant brothers taking the risk to set up a business; the college student uncertain about how hospitable the job market will prove.","500","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"In the video, Clinton says: “Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion. And I want to be that champion.” Things are getting better, but the problem still remains that thanks to deep, long-running trends — and a political system that is in many ways too paralyzed to address them — the economy remains rigged in favor of the rich. In this sense, the Clinton diagnosis of the problems those “everyday Americans” face is not substantially different from that of Obama.","501","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"We already know the eventual GOP nominee will agree that the economy is rigged against ordinary Americans, but will diagnose the reason for it very differently: The primary obstacle to economic mobility is government; lower taxes and fewer regulations will unshackle the private sector’s power to shower everyone with widely distributed gains from runaway growth.","502","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"By contrast, Clinton’s agenda will look a lot like the “inclusive prosperity” blueprint from the Center for American Progress: Paid sick leave, child care, universal pre-K, and other family-friendly policies to remove barriers to work for women; investments to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and stimulate demand; more spending on education and job training to keep pace with the challenges wrought by globalization and technological change; a minimum wage hike and policies designed to increase workers’ bargaining power and profit-sharing to boost stagnating wages. While Clinton has a lot to clarify, and will have to navigate differences among Democrats on various economic questions, the basic premise of her agenda will be that a robust policy response on many fronts is imperative to restoring eroding living standards.","503","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"One of the hallmarks of the Obama era has been that midterm electorates have been dominated by voters who agree with the smoking-hellscape portrayal of his presidency, while presidential year electorates have not. Thus, after the 2010 rout, Republicans were shocked to discover, a mere two years later, that their core assumption about Obama’s first term — there was no way he could get reelected, given how much of a disaster he had proved — was deeply flawed. My guess is the Clinton team believes Republicans, flush from their epic 2014 victory, will again over-read public disapproval of Obama and will mistakenly premise their strategy too heavily on the notion that the public agrees the Obama presidency was a disaster. And as Jonathan Chait notes, there is a decent chance the economy will continue to expand; that the desire for change will not prove as potent as Republicans expect; and that national demographics will continue to favor Democrats.","504","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"
"The Clinton gamble is that swing voters won’t necessarily be seduced by the GOP promise of dramatic change, particularly after hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars are spent defining that change through a contrast of the GOP nominee’s agenda with her own. Just as happened in 2012.","505","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/13/what-hillary-clintons-campaign-announcement-video-tells-us/"

"The unknowns are unknown in part because there are few easy answers to some of the questions people want answered. Exactly what is a 21st-century economic plan that can do something about stagnant wages and the lack of economic mobility? Clinton and her Republican rivals face the same quandary on this.

"Clinton’s history suggests no big-bang solution to these profound problems, but rather it shows a wealth of smaller initiatives that, however worthy or potentially effective, are not the stuff of grand or uplifting campaign rhetoric.

"In that sense, there will be no new Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail beginning this coming week. She is a fully formed politician, with a lengthy résumé of accomplishments and considerable baggage from a lifetime of political battles.

"Clinton has plenty of knowledge about the issues, as well as the capacity to command as much outside expertise as she needs. She can offer lots of white papers on different policies. In late 1991, her husband delivered three speeches that outlined both the New Democratic philosophy and the details of the policies that he wanted to pursue.

"Where Clinton’s candidacy is likely to rise or fall is on how the American people respond to her personally. She is a divisive and polarizing figure — not just because of her own history but because that is the nature of politics in this period of history.

"She may do that again, but the questions voters have about her go beyond where she came from. Her initial trips will be watched for what she says and how she says it.

"Some of those who think Clinton should wait make two arguments in Thursday’s Wall Street Journal: Waiting to announce lets the media focus on Republicans fighting each other, and it saves money on campaign operations. (There is a third argument that others make privately: Announcing now prolongs the period when Clinton is under even more scrutiny, having to take stances on every issue while avoiding “gaffes.” But Clinton is hardly silent right now, and if Democrats are truly fearful that Clinton could seriously hurt her chances in the next few months, they should probably be looking harder for another candidate.)","539","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/12/hillary-clinton-should-jump-in-now/"
"Clinton should want the media to focus on her would-be GOP opponents clawing at each other, but, as the Iowa caucuses get closer, Republican candidates will only get nastier toward each other. At the moment, with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), the GOP candidates are still playing nice. That comity will not last. If Clinton waits until “between April and July,” which the Journal reported is the most likely date, her announcement may not just take media attention away from Paul’s tweeting, but from some more serious internal GOP fighting.","540","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/12/hillary-clinton-should-jump-in-now/"
"As for the expense of starting the campaign earlier, it is true that (at least according to former top adviser Mark Penn) Clinton’s 2008 campaign managed to blow through most of the money it raised in its first year. But the proper response to the fear of repeating those errors is not to delay the campaign, but to learn from the mistakes in 2008 and from veterans of the Obama campaign, which somehow managed not to spend as foolishly. And without serious opposition, the costs for this primary will inevitably be lower.","541","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/12/hillary-clinton-should-jump-in-now/"
"Instead, by not setting up an official campaign, Clinton has left a vacuum that various super PACs have struggled to fill. These groups haven’t been able to raise the money they were hoping to (precisely because Clinton has delayed her entrance), and at the same time various Democratic insiders are fighting with each other for influence over Clinton. This has meant that, somehow, the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination has managed to have a week of negative headlines.","542","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/12/hillary-clinton-should-jump-in-now/"
"Some might say the costs of delaying are overblown. But they are eerily similar to the strife and indecision that sank Clinton last time. As Joshua Green reported in 2008, in what is still the best post-mortem of that Clinton campaign, “Her advisers couldn’t execute strategy; they routinely attacked and undermined each other, and Clinton never forced a resolution. Major decisions would be put off for weeks until suddenly she would erupt, driving her staff to panic and misfire. … What is clear from the internal documents is that Clinton’s loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make. Her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency.” Sound familiar?","543","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/12/hillary-clinton-should-jump-in-now/"
"Clinton can avoid those mistakes this time by announcing in the next few weeks, setting up a campaign apparatus above the overlapping super PACs and committing to specific advisers.

"The campaign’s early strategy, people familiar with the outreach say, is to rely on the existing Clinton network to generate as much money for the campaign as possible without using the candidate’s time.

"Clinton still faces many of the same challenges she had seven years ago, when she went from being a juggernaut and most likely the first female president in American history to a perceived stumblebum out of touch with the political moment.

"“It is a sword in that, as a mom and grandmom from middle-class, Midwestern roots, she is uniquely positioned to talk with voters [about] being on the side of America’s families,” Lehane said. “It is a shield to deflect the predictable attacks from the opposition about the need for change in 2016.”","603","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supporters-say-clinton-developing-smarter-more-relevant-campaign-for-2016/2015/01/19/503f910e-9a9b-11e4-a7ee-526210d665b4_story.html"

Both made statements questioning whether childhood vaccinations should be mandatory, bringing a torrent of criticism, including from medical professionals who are alarmed over a recent rise in measles cases.","629","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vaccine-debate-presents-a-political-minefield--as-hillary-clinton-can-attest/2015/02/03/1fa7fc4c-abc7-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html"
"As a new first lady in 1993, Clinton championed what became the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vaccines for Children program, designed to provide free inoculations against nine diseases to children who otherwise might not get them. It now covers 14 diseases.","630","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vaccine-debate-presents-a-political-minefield--as-hillary-clinton-can-attest/2015/02/03/1fa7fc4c-abc7-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html"
"Clinton’s role in that endeavor landed her in the crossfire. Conservatives blamed her when shortfalls of some vaccines developed in subsequent years, arguing that the private market was better at allocating resources. “One of her pet projects is a bust,” the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote in a 2003 piece headlined “Hillary’s Vaccine Shortage.”","631","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vaccine-debate-presents-a-political-minefield--as-hillary-clinton-can-attest/2015/02/03/1fa7fc4c-abc7-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html"
"Meanwhile, Clinton also found herself the target of a burgeoning movement that linked the rising rate of autism to thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative that has since been removed from childhood vaccines. Some advocates of this theory went so far as to dub her “Thimerosal Hillary.”","632","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vaccine-debate-presents-a-political-minefield--as-hillary-clinton-can-attest/2015/02/03/1fa7fc4c-abc7-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html"
"For reasons that scientists cannot explain, the incidence of autism is up markedly. Last year, the CDC estimated that 1 in 68 children age 8 had been identified with the range of conditions known as autism spectrum disorder. That was about 30 percent higher than previous estimates, reported in 2012, of 1 in 88 children.","633","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vaccine-debate-presents-a-political-minefield--as-hillary-clinton-can-attest/2015/02/03/1fa7fc4c-abc7-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html"
"Clinton, as a presidential candidate in 2008, wrote in response to a candidate questionnaire: “I am committed to make investments to find the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like vaccines. . . .

"Her then-rival, Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), also called for more research into whether there was some correlation. And 2008 GOP presidential contender John McCain (R-Ariz.) went so far as to say there was “strong evidence” of a connection between vaccines and autism. But even in 2008, the weight of medical evidence was against such a link and the candidates who indulged such speculation were accused of pandering.","635","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vaccine-debate-presents-a-political-minefield--as-hillary-clinton-can-attest/2015/02/03/1fa7fc4c-abc7-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html"
"In 2010, the argument against vaccination received a devastating blow from the Lancet, a medical journal that 12 years before had published a study alleging that inoculations for measles, mumps and rubella were a cause of autism.

"Another iteration of the vaccination issue flared in the 2012 Republican primary campaign, when then-Gov. Rick ­Perry of Texas found himself under fire for a mandate requiring most girls in his state to get inoculated against the human papillomavirus, a sexual infection that can lead to cervical cancer.

"Republican leaders have not welcomed the rekindling of the vaccine debate sparked by Christie’s comment Monday that parents should have “some measure of choice” in deciding whether to vaccinate their children.

"This week’s revelation that she used only private e-mail to conduct her public business as secretary of state is not a knockout blow to the likely Democratic presidential nominee; she has weathered worse.

"In trying so hard to avoid mistakes — in this case, trying to make sure an embarrassing e-mail or two didn’t become public — Clinton made a whopper of an error.

"Her resistance to divulging information caused the Whitewater scandal to drag on — and the resulting independent-counsel investigation metastasized into an all-purpose probe that eventually exposed the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

"Clinton justifiably criticized George W. Bush’s administration in 2007 for its “secret White House e-mail accounts” — but then she became a key figure in an administration that, in its zeal to limit disclosure, pursued more leak cases under the 1917 Espionage Act than all previous administrations combined.

"This is exactly the appearance created by this week’s revelation that Clinton had been exclusively using personal e-mail during her time as the nation’s top diplomat. Her “clintonemail.com” domain is an unfortunate echo of 2007, when Bush administration officials were discovered to have conducted official business using the “gwb43.com” domain.

"“It’s the kind of step that arouses suspicion, even if it does not violate the letter of the law,” says Steven Aftergood, a specialist in government secrecy with the Federation of American Scientists.

"That would be a good start, but the reflexive secrecy is a symptom of Clinton’s broader problem, which is her debilitating caution.

"Consider her excuse for violating administration guidelines and preventing oversight into her doings. Her excuse was that “when I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal e-mail account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.” We can suspect she did it to cover her tracks, but even the excuse smacks of selfishness.

"Then there is the Uranium One deal.

In a real sense, the Clintons seem willing to betray — or at least risk — the country’s national security for financial gain. Mitt Romney put it in everyday terms: “I mean, it looks like bribery. I mean, there is every appearance that Hillary Clinton was bribed to grease the sale of, what, 20% of America’s uranium production to Russia, and then it was covered up by lying about a meeting at her home with the principals, and by erasing emails. And you know, I presume we might know for sure whether there was or was not bribery if she hadn’t wiped out thousands of emails.

"A Canadian mining executive, Ian Telfer, who donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation led a uranium mining company that was sold to the Russians, benefiting from a deal that had to be approved by Hillary Clinton’s State Department.

"On Thursday, Hillary Clinton’s campaign issued a statement dismissing the report and the book as “innuendo.” Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said there was no evidence that Clinton’s State Department approved the Russian uranium deal to benefit foundation donors. He said that Clinton was not personally involved in the interagency approval process, that the deal was approved by a variety of government agencies and that the donors involved have said they received no assistance from Clinton in the matter.","752","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/do-the-clintons-have-an-ethical-blind-spot-when-it-comes-to-their-donors/2015/04/23/24f8e74c-e9bb-11e4-9a6a-c1ab95a0600b_story.html"

"The controversy over Clinton’s e-mails as secretary of state is an early skirmish in what will be one of the defining battles of her quest for the White House. Her success will depend in significant part on which aspects the 1990s voters choose to remember.","772","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"Clinton’s foes want Americans to recall the investigations, the political circus and fascinating philosophical discussions over what the meaning of “is” is. Her supporters want every voter who casts a ballot to think about a period when the going was good, when every income group saw its standard of living rise and when the world beyond our borders looked much safer and more stable.","773","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"Round One, the e-mails saga, goes to Clinton’s opponents. Key Democrats outside her circle, realizing how badly this was playing for her, went public to push her hard to come forward, try to end the round and move on. Many Democrats were thus happy to accept her explanation Tuesday that she used a private server out of “convenience.” They were willing to trust that the e-mails she deleted really were about weddings, funerals and yoga.","774","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"They know their party has no real alternative to Clinton. They also share her dim view of a Republican Party willing to pick up any rock to throw the Clintons’ way and remember a GOP that had been happy to push the country to an impeachment drama most voters plainly didn’t want.","775","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"It was thus shrewd of her to lead Tuesday’s news conference by assailing the 47 Republican senators who wrote an open letter to Iran’s leadership by way of undermining President Obama’s nuclear negotiations. Pointing to this outlandish move reminded Democrats (and the country as a whole) that she is still dealing with an opposition that scorns the traditional rules and norms of statesmanship and politics. She also gently nudged Obama to remember which side he needs to be on.","776","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"Rallying Democrats will likely get Clinton through this storm, even if her responses will not satisfy those who will always wonder which e-mails she deleted and whether her use of a private server was not only about convenience but also a way of shielding her electronic correspondence from Freedom of Information Act and congressional requests.","777","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"But those who say the episode is about Clinton’s alleged sense of entitlement have it wrong. This actually speaks to her hard-earned paranoia about what her opponents — and the media, which in her view so often play ball with them — are willing to do to destroy her. Her mistrust may be understandable in light of the past, but it is profoundly counterproductive.","778","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"It would be naive to suggest that being more open with the media always works in favor of the transparent politician. Clinton can highlight the fact that her much-praised answer-every-question news conference on Whitewater in 1994 failed to shut down the story. She also turned out to be right that no good would come the Clintons’ way from naming a special prosecutor to investigate the matter.","779","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"On the other hand, she was wrong to resist the earlier advice of then-adviser David Gergen that she and Bill Clinton dump all of the Whitewater documents and let the journalists judge. Gergen has argued that, had this happened, “there would have been no Ken Starr, no special prosecutor, no Monica, and history would have been very different.”","780","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"Although alternative histories can never be confirmed, Clinton needs to ponder this lesson. To survive the next 20 months until Election Day, she will have to find her way toward a less viscerally antagonistic view of media scrutiny that distinguishes between partisan muggings and the sorts of questions all presidential candidates inevitably confront.","781","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"
"It may be true that recent days showed she has enemies and harsh critics not only among Republicans but also in mainstream media circles. But focusing solely on them will only encourage her to delay responding to legitimate inquiries and to write off advisers who counsel her toward a less-hostile approach to scrutiny.","782","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lesson-for-clinton/2015/03/11/62ffcc9e-c81f-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html"

"Here's the thing: Clinton shouldn't be joking. She badly needs a new relationship with the press after a 2008 campaign that was marked by the remarkably uncivil daily interactions between her press team and the reporters tasked with covering the campaign.

"He's exactly right. Jennifer Palmieri, who is expected to be the communications director, has a long history with the national media -- from her time working for John Edwards' presidential bid to her service as a senior press person in the Obama White House. Brian Fallon, expected to be the national press secretary, spent time on Capitol Hill with the irrepressible Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) before going to head press operations at the Justice Department.

"Those hires will likely make some difference in how the Clinton campaign deals with the media.

"And, in that regard there's little evidence to suggest that anything like a new beginning is likely. Hillary Clinton's handling of her news conference addressing the email controversy a few weeks back was guarded and careful -- unwilling to play ball with the media up to and including the decision to stage it at the United Nations -- a less-than-ideal location for the crush of media at the event. And there was that whole following-reporters-to-the-bathroom thing.","828","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-promised-a-new-relationship-with-the-media-but-she-was-kidding/"
"Bill Clinton, in a speech last spring at Georgetown, lamented the way the press covers politicians. “If a policymaker is a political leader and is covered primarily by the political press, there is a craving that borders on addictive to have a storyline,"" he said. ""And then once people settle on the storyline, there is a craving that borders on blindness to shoehorn every fact, every development, every thing that happens into the story line, even if it’s not the story.” And, Hillary Clinton said much the same in a speech at the University of Connecticut around the same time; ""A lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual,"" she said at the time. ""People book onto the shows, political figures, commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it’s a good show. You might not learn anything but you might be entertained and I think that’s just become an unfortunate pattern that I wish could be broken.""","829","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-promised-a-new-relationship-with-the-media-but-she-was-kidding/"
"Now, there is truth in the Clinton analysis of the media. The growth of journalists as ""brands"", the rise of social media and the growth in both the ability to measure traffic and the increasing preeminence of traffic as a definition of journalistic success have altered journalism since even the last time Hillary Clinton ran for president -- and often in not-so-good ways.","830","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-promised-a-new-relationship-with-the-media-but-she-was-kidding/"
"But, it's clear that the Clintons are not simply offering a clinical analysis on the media. Their feelings about the press are deeply held and laden with emotion, beliefs forged over more than two decades in the national spotlight.

"While ""hate"" might be overstating things somewhat, it is absolutely clear that Hillary Clinton's disdain for how the media does its collective job isn't going to disappear or even change because she says a few nice words at a dinner or hires a handful of senior press operatives who have a different approach to the media than her past flacks. Yes, people like Palmieri, Fallon and Ferguson can temper some of the media suspicion in Clintonworld but they will never cure the candidate (or her spouse) of their fundamental dislike and, more importantly, distrust of the press.","832","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-promised-a-new-relationship-with-the-media-but-she-was-kidding/"
"Now, distrusting the press isn't exactly disqualifying for a presidential candidate. In fact, bashing the media is one of the most bipartisan applause lines a pol can deliver; I have been in Democratic and Republican audiences in which a little press-bashing elicits huge cheers.

"And yet, it's hard to dispute that Clinton's relationship with the media played a role in just how difficult -- and disappointing -- that campaign was for her. Clinton has made some moves in the last few weeks that suggest she recognizes that she can't repeat those mistakes this time around. But, campaigns take their lead from the candidate.

That matters.","834","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-promised-a-new-relationship-with-the-media-but-she-was-kidding/"

"Is Hillary Clinton’s embrace of populist and/or progressive rhetoric and policy positions consistent with her long-held convictions? Or is she only doing it belatedly, to shore up her support on the left, and to keep pace with the passions unleashed among Democrats by the rise of Elizabeth Warren and other factors?","April 21","836","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"The question gained some steam last week when Clinton shifted her stances on two key issues. She came out for a Constitutional right to gay marriage, when previously she’d said it should be left to the states, and embraced drivers’ licenses for undocumented immigrants, a position she’d previously opposed.","837","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"And today the New York Times reports that Clinton allies are miffed at folks who say her populist rhetoric is merely an effort to get out ahead of Warren-ism. Someone in Clintonworld produced a dossier showing she has long argued that the wealthy are benefiting disproportionately from an economy rigged for the top, at the expense of middle and working class Americans. The Times notes that Clinton advisers argue that she is “a populist fighter who for decades has been an advocate for families and children; only now have the party and primary voters caught up.”","838","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"The real story here, I think, is what this all says about the changing nature of the Democratic Party.","839","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"It’s true that Clinton has plainly evolved her positions on gay marriage and immigration. But large swaths of the Democratic Party have evolved on these issues, too. There has been a stampede of high level Democrats coming out in support of gay marriage in recent years, in a scramble to keep pace with cultural changes that have caught everyone off guard. On immigration, the party is more unified in support of reform than it has ever been, partly a reflection of its increasingly reliance on Latinos. All of this movement is an outgrowth of a broader Democratic Party shift towards the cultural priorities of the coalition that powered Obama victories in the last two national elections — nonwhites, millennials, socially liberal college-educated whites — and away from a reliance on culturally conservative blue collar whites.","840","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"Indeed, as Ron Brownstein writes, while Clinton is hoping to reverse Obama’s losses among blue collar whites in the Rust Belt, she has no choice but to preserve the Obama coalition as perhaps her greatest asset nationally, requiring her to continue speaking to Obama voters’ priorities. So Clinton’s movement on gay rights and immigration is probably less about making the left happy, and more about keeping pace with what has become broad Democratic Party consensus — it is inevitable, and part of a much bigger story.","841","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"What about Clinton’s embrace of Warren-ism? Part of the problem for Clinton, argues Philip Bump, is that she was off performing the job of Secretary of State, and then moved into the Clinton global charity orbit, even as the widespread economic pessimism and misery in the aftermath of the crisis caused a resurgence of populism and anti-Wall Street anger, particularly among Democrats. Clinton was also largely absent from the ideological death struggles over the safety net and austerity — over Obamacare and the Paul Ryan budgets — that characterized the Obama years and no doubt colored the views of many Democrats.","842","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"What’s more, the rise of Elizabeth Warren — who has spent decades on these issues — is a real phenomenon. It has shifted the debate among many liberals towards the desire for a fully fleshed out economic worldview and agenda similar to hers, one premised on the idea that the rules are rigged in favor of the wealthy and major corporations; that the rules need to be changed; and that they need to be enforced. We don’t know where Clinton is yet on many of the details and don’t have that firm a grasp of her broader ideological instincts.","843","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"And Clinton will be pressured to fill in her positions on, among other things, whether we should expand Social Security; on the proper extent of Wall Street oversight; and on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. On these last two, Warren has laid down firm markers: Much tougher financial regulations and enforcement; a financial transactions tax to discourage more reckless risk-taking; and a much more specific critique of the trade deal than Hillary has offered.","844","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"Clinton may not end up where Warren is on some or even most of these issues. If so, it remains to be seen whether that will truly complicate her march to the nomination in any way. (A CNN poll this week found that 90 percent of liberals would be enthusiastic or satisfied if she were the nominee.) Clinton’s agenda may end up looking a lot more like the Center for American Progress’ “Inclusive Prosperity” agenda, with its focus on boosting wages, workplace flexibility, and investments in education and the future, than like Warren’s emphasis on the rigged,inequality-ridden rules that hold sway on the domestic and global economic playing field. But even so, Clinton will draw on Warren’s repertoire, and the differences won’t be all that vast.","845","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"
"Just as we’ve seen on cultural issues, the Democratic Party has shifted on economic issues, too. Compared to the foreign-policy-focused Bush years, the post-crisis Obama presidency has brought about a deepening focus among Democrats on the nuances of economic, fiscal, and social welfare policy, and a deepening appetite for a serious debate over them. In that context, it’s understandable that there is a lot of uncertainty about Clinton’s positions and instincts, and a demand that she fill them in. But that’s okay. That’s what the process is for.","846","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/21/is-hillary-a-populist-of-convenience/"

"On some level, we'll concede, this is kind of dumb. Many think that the likability question is asked of Clinton only because she's a woman, and that men aren't held to the same standards.

"The tweet also does not address a number of questions that Ms. Clinton should answer: Why did she use a private account?

"During a speech earlier this year in Canada, Clinton called “the slow rate of small- and medium-sized business formation” the most pressing short-term problem slowing America’s economic recovery. “Our economy, historically, and job creation, has been driven by small- and medium-sized businesses, and we’re just not seeing that start up again,” she added.","877","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-small-business/wp/2015/04/13/what-a-hillary-clinton-white-house-could-mean-for-businesses/"

"During her Senate tenure, Clinton was a staunch supporter of a higher minimum wage, several times floating legislation tying congressional pay raises to mandatory increases in the federal wage floor.

"Clinton has long been critical of the current tax system, particularly of loopholes that benefit corporations and wealthy individuals, but she has not yet outlined the particulars of a plan to reform the tax code.

"Small business groups have been critical of plans to overhaul the corporate tax code without also lowering the individual rate, which determines the amount paid by owners of small businesses organized as pass-through entities (such as S Corporations).

"During a speech last year in Orlando, for instance, Clinton questioned new rules that treat small businesses of 50 or more employees as large firms, a threshold that requires them to provide health care or pay a penalty.

"During her first run at the White House, Clinton issued a statement concerning new rules proposed by the Small Business Administration under then President Bush that she said would make it even harder for women-led companies to compete for government work. She noted that, “as it stands, female entrepreneurs are not getting their fair share of federal contracts,” pointing out that they represented at the time one-third of all small businesses but only received about 3 percent of federal contracts.","890","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-small-business/wp/2015/04/13/what-a-hillary-clinton-white-house-could-mean-for-businesses/"

"During her first campaign, Clinton threw her support behind proposals to lift the annual cap on H1-B visas.

"Currently, the number of H1-B visas is limited to 65,000 per year. In recent years, applications have blown past the limit in matter of weeks, prompting members of Congress from both parties to call for an expansion.

"It’s worth noting that the limit was temporarily raised twice by Congress in the late 1990’s, first to 115,000 per year and then as high as 195,000.

"Any competent political adviser or ethics lawyer would have placed the Rosatom uranium power play in the outbox labeled “stinks to high heaven.” Hillary Clinton had been warned during her confirmation hearing that the appearance of impropriety would be magnified by the Clinton Foundation’s thirst for funding. “Every new foreign donation that is accepted by the foundation,” said then-Sen.

"It is possible, of course, that Clinton had no intention of running for president at that point. Some friends were urging her not to, and a final decision was probably delayed until late in 2014.

"This was Hillary Clinton’s main argument justifying the destruction of tens of thousands of e-mails from the account she used as secretary of state: She was selflessly serving the country, so Americans should trust and count on her judgment. But, at some point, a blind spot becomes a delusion. While Clinton was secretary of state, her husband was collecting millions in undisclosed donations from foreign-controlled mining interests with business before the State Department. This is no longer some undeveloped land along the White River near Flippin, Ark. The former president was hobnobbing with Russian investment bankers, Canadian mining executives and a Central Asian dictator while the Russian atomic energy agency gained control of a good portion of the American uranium supply.

"Hillary Clinton’s “Getting Started” video dove into the culture wars with the glee of an 8-year-old cannonballing into the backyard pool by featuring two same-sex couples, including one that talks about getting married. This shouldn’t be remarkable given that 59 percent of the American people support marriage equality, which is now legal in 37 states, plus the District of Columbia, and could be the law of the land if the Supreme Court hands down a ruling making it so this June.

First, Bush supported Pence, but then he changed position once Pence did same after a disastrous defense of the indefensible law.

"Update: News broke Tuesday night that Clinton had two classified ""top secret"" e-mails on her private server and that her attorney has turned over the server and a thumb drive to the FBI. The below post, which we are re-upping, is from March.","August 12","957","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"Hillary Clinton's defense for having deleted 31,000 personal e-mails from her home server can be summarized in two words: ""Trust me."" Trust me that I didn't delete anything related to my time at the State Department; trust me that I turned over everything that might be of interest to investigators. In an interview with the Associated Press, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the committee looking into the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, indicated that he'd be applying the maxim of Ronald Reagan to the claim: Trust, but verify. Albeit maybe without the ""trust"" part.","958","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"Gowdy's request to Clinton? Hand over the server. ""Gowdy said he hopes Clinton will turn over the server voluntarily,"" the AP reported, since ""the panel does not have the authority to issue a subpoena for the server."" If necessary, the House could vote to issue a subpoena for the device (which is just a bulked-up computer with special software).","959","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"But, we wondered, what are the odds any of those 31,000 deleted e-mails would be found if the server is turned over? So we called We Recover Data, a straightforwardly named outfit in New York City, and spoke to engineering supervisor Tom Hakim and director of digital forensics Scott Gibbs. We asked them to consider the setup, which appears to be a box running Windows Server 2008 and using Microsoft Exchange as its e-mail system, neither of which is unusual, and both of which were probably in place at the outset.","960","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"Gibbs felt confident that an examination would turn up something. ""If I had to put a percentage of success on this, it would be anywhere from 90 to 95 percent successful typically,"" he said, referring to finding those e-mails. That is: ""If no other steps were taken to go in and otherwise make the data inaccessible.""","961","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"Some explanation is in order. When a file is deleted from your computer, it isn't actually deleted. Instead, the pointer the computer uses to find the file is removed, and the computer treats the space on your hard drive as reusable. Think of an abandoned house on a lot owned by the city. Simple enough to bulldoze and build something new -- but you can still see what the house used to look like.","962","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"That doesn't mean that things stick around forever. Computers randomly store data on drives, so that lot could be bulldozed and reused at any point. The more you're doing on the machine, the more likely that is. (The Macintosh operating system offers a ""secure delete"" option, which overwrites the space on the hard drive with gibberish.) When you defragment a hard drive, it moves everything around, sort of pre-bulldozing the lots, to continue the analogy.","963","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"Exchange databases are a bit different, Hakim said. The database used to store and deliver the e-mails is in something of a gated community, meaning that the bulldozers have a harder time getting inside. (Just so you know, I'm sick of this analogy, too.) Running clean-up operations in Exchange, reducing the footprint of the database (pulling in the community walls!) can do the same thing, but usually Exchange just keeps expanding the size of the database, making it more likely that deleted files can be recovered.","964","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"If the file isn't overwritten, ""we can recover that,"" Hakim said flatly. Otherwise? Probably not. That's the key.","965","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"So let's say that Gowdy got Clinton's server into Gibbs's hands. The first thing he'd do is create a ""physical forensic image,"" which creates an ""identical, bit-by-bit, zero-by-zero copy of the original hard drive."" That is used for the analysis, because it is read-only and can't be changed. He'd then try to locate the databases used by Exchange, and extract them. Then he'd perform forensic analysis of the unallocated spaces (that is, the abandoned houses) in the database itself.","966","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"But if someone came through and did clean up, or if the deleted files were overwritten, Gibbs wouldn't necessarily find anything. Asked how likely it would be that he could tell if someone had specifically tried to cover their tracks by wiping the data, he suggested it was about 70 percent likely. In other words: decent odds that a skilled technician would be able to completely hide his tracks.","967","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"Gibbs raised another point: backups. Clinton, he assumed, didn't set up the server herself, requiring a professional to come in and set it up. ""I cannot believe that any IT professional who would set this up -- knowing the nature of the data that's going to be on it and the person it's for -- would not have any kind of backup,"" he said. ""It's either incompetence or highly dubious."" There are a variety of ways this data can be backed up -- onto another hard drive, to the Internet, to magnetic tape -- and the length of time backups are kept varies. But somewhere deep in the Clinton compound at Chappaqua, those old e-mails may still be accessible on some system other than the server itself.","968","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"
"The odds any of this ever happens? Probably pretty low. There's a lot of political value in hammering Clinton on Benghazi (which is how we got to this point), but forcing her to turn over a server that is only tangentially related to that case requires another level of political effort. Overwritten or not, the odds are good that what Clinton deleted will never be seen again.","969","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/11/could-the-benghazi-committee-recover-hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-almost-certainly/"

Like me, you may be thinking, well, who doesn’t like “Tapestry?” But that’s the point. You have to be in the neighborhood of 60-plus to remember that album; otherwise, chances are you need to consult Google or Wikipedia to even know who Carole King is.

The Democrats’ trophy gubernatorial candidate in 2014, who went down in flames, was Charlie Crist in Florida — a former Republican governor. Not to mention, Democratic anchor state New York is currently led by Governor Andrew Cuomo — the son of the late Mario Cuomo, who was governor through the 1980s and into the 90s.

"Warren's argument is simple. More and more Americans are saving in individually held, 401(k) plans rather than in traditional defined-benefit pensions, exposing them to losses in the stock market.

"Campaign theory often suggests that competitive primaries in one party and a clear path in the other serves the latter party. After all, the competitive primary party spends months tearing its candidates apart, while the other gets to simply sit back and cash checks. But consider the last time there was an open presidential contest on each side. Sen.

"That election is instructive in other ways, too. What more do we know about Clinton now than we did then? She was leading by a healthy margin that year (although not as healthy as she does now), only to be overtaken by Obama as the primaries approached. A clear reason why: He was exciting. There's a benefit to being a political blank slate, as Obama was: Voters can inscribe whatever motivations or philosophies they see fit. But there's more benefit to being someone people get excited about. This was partly McCain's (and Mitt Romney's) problem. Who, really, was terribly excited about either? McCain's campaign got a jolt with the introduction of Sarah Palin, but that . . . offered mixed benefits.","1018","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/26/what-exactly-is-hillary-clintons-strategy-to-get-voters-excited-about-her-candidacy/"
"But, you're thinking, the Republicans lost in 2012, the race to which you're comparing this one! And, yes, your close reading has been rewarded with an insight. The problem with assuming that 2016 will therefore see a Republican loss is that Obama and Clinton are very different candidates -- and it's possible (although not certain) that the GOP will pick someone with a bit more panache than McCain or Romney this time around. That's really the question. Can, say, Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) survive the gauntlet (and his last name) to compel independents in a general? Can former Florida governor Jeb Bush overcome his name problems and engage voters? Or Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) or Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) or Wisconsin Gov.

"Which brings us back to a core Clinton problem: energy. No, commenters and people on Twitter, the best president is not the one who has the best ability to invigorate voters. But this is, you may have noticed, a key component of how we pick presidents in an age so thoroughly saturated with marketing. And Clinton, although not without vocal supporters, seems continuously unlikely to be the most energizing candidate. ""Ready for Hillary"" often seemed less like a grass-roots push born of uncontainable excitement than a sharp strategy from some political consultants looking to align with a winning candidate early in the process.

"The reaction of the mainstream media to the Clinton scandals is telling. News reporters and independent-minded analysts by and large seem to understand the gravity of the claims concerning foreign monies and concede that there is no “quid pro quo” or “smoking gun” required. Peter Baker of the New York Times is among those who have not been thrown off the scent of scandal. He told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that “this is a big issue for Hillary Clinton because, in fact, it goes back to some of the issues we’ve been seeing with the Clintons going to the ’90s, which is the interaction between money and politics, money and the Clintons in particular.” Likewise, Mark Halperin argued on ABC’s “This Week“: “The Clinton Foundation does great work. Some of the charges against her are overstated. That’s on one side of the ledger. On the other side of the ledger, it’s extraordinarily serious.

"As we have said, Schweizer reminded the audience that a specific quid pro quo is unnecessary. (“For example, Governor [Robert] McConnell down in Virginia, or you look at Senator [Robert] Menendez, in these cases, you didn’t have evidence of a quid pro quo. What you had was funds flowing to elected officials, some of them gifts, some of them campaign contributions and actions that were being taken by those public officials that seemed to benefit the contributors.

"Ron Fournier of National Journal summed up, “I wrote the first story back in February, this was stupid and seedy. It’s stupid politically because she’s putting herself in a position where people can’t trust her and it’s seedy because of the obvious, at the very least, perceptions of a conflict of interest. You don’t have to be a conspiracy theorist here, Chris, to know that the foreign companies hope to buy influence. You don’t have to be a lawyer to know that they violated ethics laws. You don’t have to be a historian to know that they have a history of having an ethical blind spot. They being the Clintons. And you don’t have to be a political scientist to know that this really undermines the trust that we can have in her as a potential president and if she becomes president, the trust we can have in a leader of our government.

"Schweizer and other reporters noted that there are also issues concerning her failure to abide by the terms of her agreement with the administration, failure to disclose certain speaking fees and supporters, and failure to disclose foreign donors to the foundation (which is necessitating refiling of at least five years of taxes.) John Heilemann on ABC reminded us, “There are now several that we know of at this moment, several documented instances where whether or not it’s illegal, where they broke their agreement with the administration. And when you think about the president having set a standard of being the most transparent and open administration in history, and what the Clintons have done here, clearly, is not the most transparent and open.” Likewise, Jeff Zeleny of CNN reiterated that this “does raise questions of speaking fees, of why that one $2.35 million donation was disclosed when she was becoming secretary of state in January of ’09. She signed a document saying she would disclose all contributions to the foundation that apparently did not happen here.

Clinton never wants to say anything herself that is flat-out wrong or that can be disproved.

"Andrew Bleeker, a digital marketing guru and veteran of Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaigns, also could join the Clinton campaign in an advisory role, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the Clinton team's staffing decisions.","1098","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-adds-top-digital-talent-to-campaign-in-waiting/"
"Goff is expected to serve as a top adviser for digital strategy to the Clinton campaign, which would enable him to continue running his private business. Dowd, who is widely respected in the Clinton orbit as a skilled manager and has a personal relationship with the former secretary of state, will be on staff overseeing the campaign's day-to-day digital operations. And Lowenstein, who has been vice president of digital at Emily's List, one of the outside groups laying the groundwork for Clinton's candidacy, would join the staff as deputy digital director.","1099","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-adds-top-digital-talent-to-campaign-in-waiting/"
"In 2008, the Obama team pioneered the use of new technologies for political campaigns while the Clinton campaign struggled to keep up. Now, two cycles later, Clinton is the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination and has her pick from the party's deep bench of digital talent, which includes alumni of Obama's innovative campaigns.","1100","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-adds-top-digital-talent-to-campaign-in-waiting/"
"During his 2012 stint, Goff led a staff of 250 and oversaw the Obama campaign's social media outreach, online advertising and fundraising, and product development and design. He managed state-level digital efforts in more than 25 battleground states during Obama's 2008 campaign. Goff is a partner at Precision Strategies, a firm he co-founded with Obama campaign veterans Stephanie Cutter and Jennifer O'Malley Dillon.","1101","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-adds-top-digital-talent-to-campaign-in-waiting/"
"Bleeker is another Obama world star, having overseen digital marketing strategy on the president's 2008 and 2012 campaigns. He founded Bully Pulpit Interactive, a digital firm that advises corporations as well as political campaigns, and worked for Clinton's 2008 campaign.","1102","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-adds-top-digital-talent-to-campaign-in-waiting/"
"Dowd has been Clinton's director of digital strategy at the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. She served as new media director on Clinton's 2008 campaign and followed Clinton to the State Department, where she worked as an innovation adviser running Foggy Bottom's digital diplomacy efforts. She also worked at the White House as senior adviser to the U.S. chief technology officer.","1103","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-adds-top-digital-talent-to-campaign-in-waiting/"
"Lowenstein joins the Clinton team from Emily's List, which helps elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. She is credited with expanding the group's reach on social media and breaking its online fundraising records in the 2014 midterm campaign cycle. Emily's List is preparing to play a major role supporting Clinton from the outside and earlier this month honored her at its 30th anniversary gala. Lowenstein previously has served as deputy digital director for the Democratic National Committee and for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe's 2013 campaign.","1104","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/24/hillary-clinton-adds-top-digital-talent-to-campaign-in-waiting/"

"Viewed one way, this is bad news for Rubio -- Clinton is upstaging the Republican senator, whose plans to kick off his presidential campaign in Miami Monday afternoon were carefully arranged by his aides weeks ago. Sure, the media will cover Rubio. But Clinton's announcement is going to attract a lot of political news attention that would otherwise be his.","1106","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-is-stepping-all-over-marco-rubios-announcement-or-is-she/"
"Viewed another way, this is an opportunity for Rubio. He can seize the moment as a chance to showcase himself as a stark contrast to the clear Democratic frontrunner and demonstrate to voters how he would stack up against her in a general election. It's a chance to look like he's leading the charge to prevent Clinton from getting elected.","1107","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-is-stepping-all-over-marco-rubios-announcement-or-is-she/"

"The soft launch of Clinton’s not-yet-declared candidacy has been engulfed in twin conflagrations: the disclosure that the Clinton Foundation had accepted donations from dodgy countries and the discovery that she conducted her business as secretary of state using a personal e-mail account.

"On the other hand, maybe it’s just as well that Clinton didn’t join the firefighters in the capital this week. They aren’t exactly blazing with enthusiasm for her candidacy.

"The two most viable alternatives to Clinton spoke at the IAFF gathering Monday: Biden, who projects sincerity, blue-collar appeal and solid competence; and Warren, who, with her passion and righteous indignation, could ignite a populist movement.

"And so the Democratic faithful are more or less resigned to Clinton drawing little primary opposition, and hoping that the disastrous launch of her candidacy doesn’t get worse. There’s potential it will, because, as Amy Chozick of the New York Times noted, Clinton’s efforts this week to commemorate the anniversary of her 1995 women’s rights speech in Beijing are now being undermined by the discovery that the Clinton Foundation accepted money from Middle Eastern countries known for violence and discrimination against women.","1126","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/not-so-fired-up-about-hillary-clinton/2015/03/09/6488da40-c6a5-11e4-aa1a-86135599fb0f_story.html"

"Biden established his working-class bona fides with the union members. “In a little state like mine, the fire hall is where you get married,” he said. “It’s the country club for the guys and the women I was raised with.” Referring to Republicans as “the other outfit” and “the other team,” and throwing in Bidenisms such as “malarkey,” Biden told the firefighters, “I resent the attacks on you by those, particularly, in the other outfit that see you as an obstacle to overcome, a drag on the community, instead of the heart and soul and essence of the community.”","1128","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/not-so-fired-up-about-hillary-clinton/2015/03/09/6488da40-c6a5-11e4-aa1a-86135599fb0f_story.html"
"Warren followed Biden’s folksiness with a brief and incendiary speech, at points shaking with the ferocity of her delivery. “There’s plenty of money for billions of dollars in subsidies for big oil companies. There’s plenty of money for special breaks for the owners of thoroughbred racehorses. There’s plenty of money for extra deals for the folks who run NASCAR racetracks,” she said. “So why is there no money to make our country work? I’ll tell you why.

"After her speech, she joined Massachusetts firefighters for a photo, then gave an impromptu speech about the outrage that “you are out there with your begging bowls” while billions in tax breaks go to corporations. “We are in trouble,” she said. “We are up against the ropes. . . .

"“On a [target] scale of 1 to 10, she’s a 10,” said Schaeffer, who is now in the cybersecurity industry. “When you think of treaties, trade negotiations, any thing that the secretary of state would be involved in, she would be an incredibly lucrative target — maybe even more so than the president.”","1147","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/security-of-hillary-clintons-private-e-mail-server-comes-under-scrutiny/2015/03/10/fcccfb78-c737-11e4-aa1a-86135599fb0f_story.html"

"Does Hillary Clinton have a serious legal problem because she may have transmitted classified information on her private e-mail server? After talking with a half-dozen knowledgeable lawyers, I think this “scandal” is overstated.

"“It’s common” that people end up using unclassified systems to transmit classified information, said Jeffrey Smith, a former CIA general counsel who’s now a partner at Arnold & Porter, where he often represents defendants suspected of misusing classified information.","1158","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"“There are always these back channels,” Smith explained. “It’s inevitable, because the classified systems are often cumbersome and lots of people have access to the classified e-mails or cables.” People who need quick guidance about a sensitive matter often pick up the phone or send a message on an open system. They shouldn’t, but they do.","1159","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"“It’s common knowledge that the classified communications system is impossible and isn’t used,” said one former high-level Justice Department official. Several former prosecutors said flatly that such sloppy, unauthorized practices, although technically violations of law, wouldn’t normally lead to criminal cases.","1160","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state has been a nagging campaign issue for months. Critics have argued that the most serious problem is possible transmission of classified information through that server. Many of her former top aides have sought legal counsel. But experts in national-security law say there may be less here than it might appear.","1161","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"First, experts say, there’s no legal difference whether Clinton and her aides passed sensitive information using her private server or the official “state.gov” account that many now argue should have been used. Neither system is authorized for transmitting classified information. Second, prosecution of such violations is extremely rare. Lax security procedures are taken seriously, but they’re generally seen as administrative matters.","1162","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"Potential criminal violations arise when officials knowingly disseminate documents marked as classified to unauthorized officials or on unclassified systems, or otherwise misuse classified materials. That happened in two cases involving former CIA directors that are cited as parallels for the Clinton e-mail issue, but are quite different. John Deutch was pardoned in 2001 for using an unsecured CIA computer at his home to improperly access classified material; he reportedly had been prepared to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. David Petraeus pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in April for “knowingly” removing classified documents from authorized locations and retaining them at “unauthorized locations.” Neither case fits the fact pattern with the Clinton e-mails.","1163","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"Clinton defended herself Aug. 18 with a carefully worded statement: “I did not send classified material, and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified.” Those may sound like weasel words, but they actually go to the heart of what might constitute a criminal case.","1164","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"What happens in the real world of the State Department? Smith takes the hypothetical example of an assistant secretary who receives a classified cable from, say, Paris, about a meeting with the French foreign minister and wants quick guidance from the secretary. So he dashes off an e-mail — rather than sending a classified cable that would be seen by perhaps a dozen people.","1165","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"“Technically, he has taken classified information and put it onto an unclassified system,” Smith said. “It’s the same as picking up a telephone and talking about it. It’s not right. But the challenge of getting the secretary’s attention — getting guidance when you need it — is an inevitable human, bureaucratic imperative. Is it a crime? Technically, perhaps yes. But it would never be prosecuted.”","1166","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"Informal back channels existed long before e-mail. One former State Department official recalled the days when most embassies overseas had only a few phones authorized for secret communications. Rather than go to the executive office to make such a call, officers would use their regular phones, bypassing any truly sensitive details. “Did we cross red lines? No doubt. Did it put information at risk? Maybe. But, if you weren’t in Moscow or Beijing, you didn’t worry much,” this former official said.","1167","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"
"Back channels are used because the official ones are so encrusted by classification and bureaucracy. State had the “Roger Channel,” named after former official Roger Hilsman, for sending secret messages directly to the secretary. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had a similar private channel. CIA station chiefs could send communications known as “Aardwolves” straight to the director.","1168","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-e-mail-scandal-that-isnt/2015/08/27/b1cabed8-4cf4-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"

"Clinton was no stranger to the rules of the federal government. She had to know that if she used a State Department account, her 60,000-plus e-mails would become part of the official record. She certainly knew, without any doubt, that her political opponents would delight in rummaging through her communications.

"But all of that is beside the point. If you accept the job of secretary of state, you inevitably surrender some of your privacy. Any public official’s work-related e-mails are the modern equivalent of the letters, memos and diaries that fill the National Archives. They tell our nation’s history and belong to all of us.

"So I wish Hillary Clinton would be respectful enough to say, “I’m sorry. I was wrong.” I wish she wouldn’t insult our intelligence by claiming she only did what other secretaries of state had done.

The explanation that she didn’t want people prying into private matters such as “planning for [daughter] Chelsea’s wedding . . . as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes” is unconvincing.

"And I wish I could be sure that Clinton is now, finally, doing everything in her power to ensure that any extant e-mails are turned over to the State and Justice departments. Unfortunately, I can’t.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by more than 30 points in an average of recent national polls. Her strength among women and minorities — vital segments of the Democratic Party coalition — looks overwhelming.

"If Clinton makes it to the general election, however, she has needlessly handed her Republican opponent a weapon. Her trustworthiness, as measured by polls, was always a relative weakness.

"Here's why. Remember that back in March, following the revelation that Clinton had exclusively used a private e-mail address during her time as secretary of state -- going against Obama Administration protocol in the process -- she insisted that the server would not -- and need not -- be turned over to a third party. “I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private,"" she told a reporter during a press conference at the United Nations.

"Use common sense. If you had your own private e-mail server, would you rather keep it private or allow a third party -- ANY third party -- to inspect it? I mean, come on. Also, if you HAD voluntarily turned it over, would your spokesman not comment on whether you were told to give it over or whether you did it on your own?

"Oomph. Clinton, who seems to have a blind spot as to why the e-mail server story is such a big deal, made a bunch of mistakes in that brief interaction with the media that you would assume someone of her deep experience would have been able to avoid. Here's a list of what she did wrong.","1262","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/5-things-hillary-clinton-did-wrong-in-her-nevada-e-mail-press-conference/"
"1. She sounds like a lawyer. Her first response is, as it was when she first addressed the existence of the private server back in March, to insist that she is in no legal jeopardy. ""What I did was legally permitted, number one, first and foremost, okay?"" Clinton said. Sure. No neutral observer has suggested that there is any illegality in what Clinton did. But there's a big difference between how this story plays in a court of law and how it plays in the court of public opinion. Clinton seems not to grasp that simply because she is not being charged with anything doesn't mean that this whole set-up doesn't look bad and raise doubts about her among voters. Talking in legal terms does not help Clinton's political case on this.","1263","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/5-things-hillary-clinton-did-wrong-in-her-nevada-e-mail-press-conference/"

I don't doubt that there are regular disagreements between the State Department and the intelligence community's inspector general about who gets to look at what. And we know that other secretaries of state have used private e-mail addresses. But what Clinton elides over are these two facts: (1) She is the first secretary of state in history to exclusively use a private e-mail address and server while on the job, and (2) she is running for president in 2016. Those two facts explain why her situation does (and should) get more attention and scrutiny.","1264","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/5-things-hillary-clinton-did-wrong-in-her-nevada-e-mail-press-conference/"

"3. She's dismissive. Yes, Ed is interrupting her. Yes, he is close to antagonistic. But no, he isn't doing anything that Clinton hasn't seen a billion times before. From the start, she is quite clearly annoyed with the line of questioning and is unable to mask that fact. (All politicians get annoyed with reporters' questions; good ones find ways not to show it.) Clinton does not believe this should be a story or that she should have to keep answering questions about it. But that's not her decision to make. Politics is about dealing with the world as it is, not as you want it to be. So no, Clinton doesn't have to like that she's being subjected to more questions about her e-mail practices.

"4. She's sarcastic. Under the best possible reading, Clinton's response to whether she ""wiped"" the server — ""like with a cloth or something?"" — is evidence of a lack of technological know-how. Which is fine. But it's hard for me to believe that, amid tons and tons of questions about what was/is on the server and whether the server was purposely erased over the last many months, Clinton is entirely unaware of what the term ""wipe"" means in this context. And if she does know, then her ""with a cloth or something?"" line is just terrible politics. People generally dislike sarcasm from their politicians; that's especially true when that sarcasm is tied to an issue that many people view as a very serious one.","1267","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/5-things-hillary-clinton-did-wrong-in-her-nevada-e-mail-press-conference/"

Clinton responds: ""Nobody talks to me about it other than you guys."" While I can't fact-check what people talk to Clinton about every second of every day, there is new polling data that suggest that her handling of her e-mail server is of concern to a significant number of voters. Fifty-six percent of those polled in a new CNN/ORC survey said that Clinton did something wrong by using a private e-mail server during her time as secretary of state. Slightly more than six in 10 Democrats (63 percent) believe Clinton did nothing wrong — that's down from 71 percent in March — while slightly more than one in three independents (37 percent) say the same.

"Hillary Clinton has a problem. In a new Quinnipiac University national poll, more than one in three voters say that the most important trait they are looking for in a 2016 candidate is being ""honest and trustworthy."" Almost six in ten of those polled said that Hillary Clinton lacks those two traits.","July 30","1356","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/30/voters-want-someone-who-is-honest-and-trustworthy-in-2016-they-dont-think-thats-hillary-clinton/"

"The Q poll trend line shows a steady line of distrust towards Clinton. In May 39 percent of people said she was honest and trustworthy. In April that number was 38 percent. And, before you dismiss Clinton's honesty issue as simply the carping of Republicans, look inside the Q numbers. Just 31 percent of independents describe her as honest and trustworthy while 62 percent say she is not. One in five Democrats (19 percent) say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy(!).","1359","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/30/voters-want-someone-who-is-honest-and-trustworthy-in-2016-they-dont-think-thats-hillary-clinton/"
"Need more evidence of how bad Clinton's numbers are on the honesty question? She and Donald Trump have nearly identical ratings on it.

"Take a step back from the honest/trustworthy question and you see that, at the moment, Clinton's image is suffering more broadly in the Q poll.

"What the Q numbers suggest -- particularly when contextualized with some of the other data points out there -- is that Clinton has a real and sustaining trust problem in the eyes of the public.

"The most surprising revelation in recent presidential polling is not that Donald Trump has low favorability in key states — a welcome indicator of national sanity — but rather that Hillary Clinton’s numbers are almost as bad.

"Horse-race polling conducted early in a presidential contest means very little, as President Fred Thompson and President Howard Dean can attest. But while early polls are not predictive of outcomes, they can be indicative of weaknesses. In a recent CNN/ORC poll, 57 percent of adults did not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy. According to an AP-Gfk poll, only 31 percent of likely voters think the word “honest” describes Clinton well. And in a recent Quinnipiac poll of key states, 59 percent of Iowa voters, 55 percent of Virginia voters and 62 percent of Colorado voters did not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy.","1366","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-democrats-wounded-queen/2015/07/27/c7c33808-3478-11e5-8e66-07b4603ec92a_story.html"

"One of the lively debates among conservatives over the past several months has been: Is Clinton a strong candidate or a weak one? I have been on the “strong” side.

She has almost managed the remarkable achievement of clearing the Democratic field through a perception of her own inevitability and a reputation for remembering disloyalty.","1368","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-democrats-wounded-queen/2015/07/27/c7c33808-3478-11e5-8e66-07b4603ec92a_story.html"
"But arguments on the “weak” side are getting stronger. Since her video announcement in April, perceptions of Clinton’s character and leadership have worsened — which is not really the purpose of a campaign. Her vulnerability on the populist left — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is supported by a majority of white Democratic liberals — has shifted Clinton’s candidacy decisively to the left.

"And then there are the e-mails — at least the ones that haven’t been erased at her own discretion. Congressional investigations and referrals to the Justice Department “related to the potential compromise of classified information” will continue to be untieable loose ends. Clinton will find it impossible to contend she has nothing to hide while hiding her personal server from forensic scrutiny.

"Clinton asserts she has violated no rules or laws. This brings back so many memories. During the Clinton era, rules were not generally violated; they were skirted, reinterpreted, navigated, twisted, kneaded and massaged. Americans always cut Bill Clinton slack, giving him the benefit of many doubts. Hillary Clinton — lacking most of her husband’s preternatural political skills — may not have the same luxury.","1371","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-democrats-wounded-queen/2015/07/27/c7c33808-3478-11e5-8e66-07b4603ec92a_story.html"
"Senior Democrats are seeing what the rest of us see — a Clinton campaign that is burning money and losing ground. At what point do party leaders begin a panicked search for alternatives? Not yet. But when? “When public sentiment consistently falls in this [polling] category,” a former Democratic official told me. “When people say enough is enough and can’t deal with the Clinton psychodrama anymore.

"This former official thinks that Clinton has the month of August to right her listing campaign. If that doesn’t happen, Vice President Joe Biden’s colorful trial balloon may rise. And when a candidate’s main argument is inevitability — as Clinton’s is — doubts are a crack in the ice that quickly spreads.","1373","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-democrats-wounded-queen/2015/07/27/c7c33808-3478-11e5-8e66-07b4603ec92a_story.html"
"I’ll admit I am still not convinced that Clinton is a weak candidate, at least for her party’s nomination. Biden, for all his dizzy charm, is less imaginable as president than Clinton. Also, she has a wicked inside political game. Nearly half of the Democratic congressional delegation has endorsed her. Her campaign has effectively courted the key Democratic interest groups. And, harder to quantify, Clinton has generated a network of loyalty by being a thoughtful, caring person in private. As we saw in 2008, she is most attractive as a politician when she is most vulnerable.","1374","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-democrats-wounded-queen/2015/07/27/c7c33808-3478-11e5-8e66-07b4603ec92a_story.html"

If Hillary Clinton is concerned about jackbooted thugs “literally pulling people out of their homes” to deport them, she ought to talk to her husband.","1457","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sorry-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-is-no-nazi/2015/08/31/2cee0bda-4fdc-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"
"But her outrageous comments raise another question: Is there any Republican candidate, including Trump, who is seriously proposing forcible mass deportations of illegal immigrants?","1458","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sorry-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-is-no-nazi/2015/08/31/2cee0bda-4fdc-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"
"The answer is no. And therein lies the secret even many of Trump’s most ardent supporters don’t even realize. While Trump speaks with a lot of bombast, his immigration plan is actually quite moderate — a form of amnesty that has been endorsed by the New York Times editorial page and nearly passed the U.S. Senate, where five Democrats senators voted for it.","1459","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sorry-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-is-no-nazi/2015/08/31/2cee0bda-4fdc-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"
"Listen closely to what Trump is actually proposing. In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, Trump explained his plan this way: “I would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legal. . . . A lot of these people are helping us . . . and sometimes it’s jobs a citizen of the United States doesn’t want to do. I want to move ’em out, and we’re going to move ’em back in and let them be legal.”","1460","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sorry-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-is-no-nazi/2015/08/31/2cee0bda-4fdc-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"
"What he is describing is a policy called “touchback,” and it’s not new or especially controversial. In 2007, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (Tex.) — a moderate Republican — offered a “touchback” amendment that would have required illegal immigrants to return to their home countries to apply for a special “Z visa” that would allow them to reenter the United States and work indefinitely. Her amendment lost by a relatively close margin, 53-45. It got five Democratic votes — Sens. Claire McCaskill, Max Baucus, Jon Tester, Byron Dorgan and John Rockefeller all supported it.","1461","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sorry-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-is-no-nazi/2015/08/31/2cee0bda-4fdc-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"
"The idea was considered so reasonable that in an April 22, 2007, editorial entitled “Progress on Immigration,” the New York Times declared “It’s not ideal, but if a touchback provision is manageable and reassures people that illegal immigrants are indeed going to the back of the line, then it will be defensible.”","1462","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sorry-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-is-no-nazi/2015/08/31/2cee0bda-4fdc-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"
"So what Trump is proposing today — sending illegal immigrants back to their home countries and then allowing the “good ones” to return in an “expedited” fashion — was not considered a radical idea back in 2007. In fact, the idea even got the support of — wait for it — illegal immigrants. In 2007, the Los Angeles Times did the first telephone poll of illegal immigrants and asked whether they would go home under a “touchback” law that allowed them to return with legal status. Sixty-three percent said yes, 27 percent said no and 10 percent were undecided. If they were promised a path to citizenship when they returned, the number who said they would leave and return legally grew to 85 percent.","1463","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sorry-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-is-no-nazi/2015/08/31/2cee0bda-4fdc-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"
"In other words, the vast majority of illegal immigrants would voluntarily cooperate with Trump’s plan. Sorry, Hillary Clinton, no “boxcars” necessary.","1464","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sorry-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-is-no-nazi/2015/08/31/2cee0bda-4fdc-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"
"If anything, the “touchback” plan was attacked by conservatives. In a 2007 editorial, National Review called the senate’s touchback bill a “fraud” that gives illegal aliens “their own privileged pathway” ahead of “applicants who have complied with U.S. immigration laws.” So if you get past Trump’s bluster, the plan he is proposing is so liberal that it earned the support of the New York Times and the opposition of National Review.","1465","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sorry-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-is-no-nazi/2015/08/31/2cee0bda-4fdc-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html"

Bill Clinton was paid at least $26 million in speaking fees by entities that were major donors to the foundation.

"The vast array of contributors to the foundation (and those who paid the Clintons to give speeches) gives endless material to critics, and to the media: the uranium mining company that funneled money to the foundation while it had business before the State Department; the State arms-sale approvals for foundation contributors; the scores of foundation donors who lobbied State; the Canadian affiliate of the foundation that didn’t disclose its donors; the Keystone XL pipeline bankers who paid the Clintons to speak; the fees charged to a charity for tsunami victims; the use of an unreported pass-through company; Hillary Clinton’s brother’s ties to a Haitian gold mine; the money from countries with poor human-rights records; and contributions to the foundation from Qatar while Bill Clinton gave a boost to its controversial World Cup bid.","1514","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-guilt-by-association/2015/06/04/bd836dc4-0b13-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html"

"The strategy relies on calculations about the 2016 landscape, including that up to 31 percent of the electorate will be Americans of color — a projection that may be overly optimistic for her campaign.

"The game plan also hinges on a conclusion by Clinton strategists that the broad appeal of issues such as paid family leave, a higher minimum wage and more affordable college will help outweigh any concerns about costs. And while the early liberal tilt focuses on domestic issues more likely to drive voters this cycle, Clinton will also have to win over liberal voters still skeptical of her hawkish reputation on foreign policy.","1522","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/running-to-the-left-hillary-clinton-is-banking-on-the-obama-coalition-to-win/2015/05/17/33b7844a-fb28-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html"

"Clinton’s full embrace of same-sex marriage in the first days of her campaign was followed by clear statements in favor of scrapping get-tough immigration and incarceration policies — many of which took root during her husband’s administration.

"By taking such positions, aides and advisers hope Clinton will not only inoculate herself against a serious challenge from the left in the primaries, but that she also will be able to push on through the general election.

"“Clinton’s moves reinforce all her worst attributes as a candidate and hurt her image among voters of all stripes,” Reed said. “Progressive voters know that she’s not truly one of them,” while swing voters “see a desperate politician staking out far-left positions that are outside of the mainstream of most Americans.”","1531","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/running-to-the-left-hillary-clinton-is-banking-on-the-obama-coalition-to-win/2015/05/17/33b7844a-fb28-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html"
"Many political strategists also say Clinton will be hard-pressed to re-create Obama’s winning coalition and that the 30 percent to 31 percent non-white turnout that some of her outside backers are projecting may be out of reach. Exit polls show non-white turnout was 28 percent in 2012 and 26 percent in 2008.

"The bold stance on immigration is widely seen as one way to jump-start the expansion of Hispanic support Clinton will need, although advisers say she had already made up her mind about citizenship and there was no reason to put off an announcement.

"Advisers do not dispute that Clinton has a finger to the wind of the national mood, but they insist the timing and substance of her positions are not driven by polling.

"Clinton will debut policy proposals to ease lending bottlenecks for small businesses on campaign trips to Iowa and New Hampshire this week.

"Clinton’s 2008 campaign was so focused on polling data and the consequences of saying the wrong thing that it sometimes appeared paralyzed.

"There’s a chance she’ll find some Republican support for legislation to restore public financing of elections — if only because the absence of such a system effectively means presidents are elected to eight-year terms, because their ability to raise virtually unlimited sums as incumbents all but guarantees reelection.","1566","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-hypocrisy/2015/05/19/f8a7b194-fe48-11e4-8b6c-0dcce21e223d_story.html"
"Stuart Stevens, who ran Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign, notes that only one incumbent president in the past 125 years who was not in the public-finance system lost his bid for reelection — and that was Herbert Hoover. Stevens says the 2016 winner, Democrat or Republican, “is going to be almost impossible to defeat” in 2020. (Super PACs won’t completely offset that incumbent advantage, he figures, because the funds are at least theoretically outside the candidate’s control.) The prospect of a de facto eight-year term for a Democratic president could persuade Republicans to support a revival of public finance even if it isn’t “normally in their DNA,” Stevens argues.","1567","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-hypocrisy/2015/05/19/f8a7b194-fe48-11e4-8b6c-0dcce21e223d_story.html"
"If she’s serious in her commitment to campaign-finance reform, Clinton doesn’t have to wait until the election. Stevens suggests she challenge her opponents to join her in opting into the moribund public-finance system (though its matching funds would be absurdly low). To keep the super PACs from filling the void, she could propose both sides disavow them, as Republican Scott Brown and Democrat Elizabeth Warren did in their 2012 Massachusetts Senate race, pledging to pay a penalty if outside groups ran ads in their race.","1568","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-hypocrisy/2015/05/19/f8a7b194-fe48-11e4-8b6c-0dcce21e223d_story.html"

"First, the New York Times’ Nick Confessore and Michael Schmidt add some detail to an ongoing story about former speechwriter Sidney Blumenthal’s access to Hillary Clinton during her time in the office.","1620","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"When asked about this Tuesday, Clinton responded as follows:","1621","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"That’s… not a comforting answer.","1622","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"On the one hand, she’s right. Every policy principal comes into office with a coterie of close friends and private advisers that can bend the principal’s ear from time to time. It happened fairly frequently when I was working in government. As a result, an op-ed or private correspondence by a close friend gets pulsed into the system by a cabinet secretary that otherwise would have disappeared into the ether. This phenomenon is hardly unique to Hillary Clinton.","1623","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"But the depth of this phenomenon might be unique to Clinton. I can’t recall a private person being able to insert 25 memos into the system — especially someone like Blumenthal, who was in no way, shape or form a Libya expert. And it’s costly for a bureaucracy to shoot these things down, particularly when they come from the secretary.","1624","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"Furthermore, as she put it, Hillary Clinton has many, many old friends. The notion of her, as president, continually doing something like this from her personal Gang of 500 is a wee bit disturbing.","1625","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"Even more disturbing, however, is the Wall Street Journal’s Laura Meckler’s report on how Clinton’s political staff at the State Department interfered with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests:","1626","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"There is simply no way to spin this as anything other than Clinton’s staff contravening the rules of the bureaucratic game to protect her political viability for a 2016 campaign.","1627","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"There’s no evidence that either Blumenthal’s memos or Mills’s interference in FOIA releases affected the substance of American foreign policy — these are, as they say, process stories.","1628","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"But they’re pretty damn disturbing process stories. They feed a narrative that is consistent with what’s emerged about the Clinton’s State Department e-mails and the Clinton Foundation donations: that even if she did nothing wrong, Hillary Clinton and her staff act as though the ordinary rules do not apply to her.","1629","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"At some point, Clinton will actually roll out some policy proposals, and have to answer some tough policy questions. Until then, however, this is the stuff that should be debated about the possibility of president Hillary Clinton. And this stuff is not trivial.","1630","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"","1631","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/the-unbearable-lightness-of-hillary-clintons-management-style/"
"Hillary Clinton doesn’t like the media, and they don’t like her. Both have legitimate reasons for feeling as they do, but there’s no getting around that simple fact. Clinton’s grievances go back two and a half decades, and what has reporters agitated at the moment is that Clinton is making it difficult for them to do their jobs, by not talking much to the them or providing the steady stream of public events out of which they can write stories.","May 22","1632","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"Their frustration is starting to bubble to the surface. New York Times reporter Jason Horowitz, following Clinton in Iowa, wrote a story today about how her campaign is keeping reporters at arm’s length, then tweeted a link to the story with the description: “Queen Hillary and the Everyday Americans of the Round Table distribute alms to the clamoring press.”","1633","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"But if Clinton is overly concerned about their feelings, it’s hard to tell. Instead, she’s acting as though she isn’t afraid of the press at all.","1634","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"We’re in the midst of the second media revolution Bill and Hillary Clinton have lived through, both of which changed how politicians relate to reporters. In the first one, which occurred in the 1990s, the media universe expanded and became more partisan, as conservative talk radio became a major force and cable news emerged to cover politics around the clock (Fox News was founded in 1996, in time for the Lewinsky scandal). The incumbent news organizations found themselves pressured by the right, bullied into covering stories they might have paid little attention to and forced to accelerate their news-gathering. Talk radio and cable were perfect for taking allegations against the president — legitimate or otherwise — and forcing them onto the agenda of the “old media” outlets, where they gained legitimacy and shaped the events of the day.","1635","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"But despite all the scandal fodder his administration (and his private life, and his past) provided, Bill Clinton managed to not only survive but leave office with approval ratings in the 60s.","1636","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"Fifteen years later, Hillary Clinton is running for president in the midst of another media revolution, one that not only pressures mainstream news organizations and the reporters who populate them, but makes those reporters feel threatened and even marginalized.","1637","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"Look what has happened since she began running. We’ve already had a couple of supposed scandals — her State Department emails and the Clinton Foundation’s donors — which were given blanket coverage in the mainstream media. And how have Clinton’s fortunes been affected? Barely at all. She’s still leading all her potential general election opponents by eight or nine points.","1638","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"Don’t forget, in ordinary circumstances, reporters love scandal. Scandal is exciting, it’s dramatic, at its best it’s full of juicy revelations, scrambling politicians, and uncertain outcomes. Clinton scandals, on the other hand, have gotten awfully boring. Some accusation emerges, we learn that Bill or Hillary (or both) did something questionable, Republicans cry that it’s worse than Watergate, the Clintons are less than forthcoming with information, and in the end it turns out to have been a tempest in a teapot. Go through it over and over and it ceases to be interesting, for both reporters and the public.","1639","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"And while I don’t have any direct evidence for this, I suspect that to at least some degree reporters share conservatives’ frustration that all the Clinton scandals and mini-scandals and pseudo-scandals haven’t taken them down. In a way it’s an affront to the power of the press. When we splash headline after headline about allegations of misbehavior across our papers, when we devote hour after hour on television to the fact that “questions are being raised,” well that’s supposed to make an impact. It’s supposed to drive the politician in question to the depths of ignominy. It’s not supposed to leave them in exactly the same position as they were when it started.","1640","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"Unlike the last media revolution, the current one may work in Hillary Clinton’s favor. She seems to understand that a snarky article in the New York Times is not going to hurt her, not when she’s already so well-known and there are so many other sources of information competing for voters’ attention. She can reach those voters through local news, through YouTube, through Twitter, through Facebook, and through a hundred other channels. And without a strong primary challenge, she has all the time she wants. If she doesn’t feel like taking reporters’ questions for a couple of weeks at a stretch, she doesn’t have to.","1641","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"All that, of course, will make the reporters covering her even more perturbed. They’re professionals, but they’re also human beings whose feelings, worries, and resentments inevitably leak through into their work. They already know Clinton is suspicious of them, and they don’t like it when they get shunted to the back of the room, unable to ask what they hope will be tough questions, while Clinton makes dull small-talk with another group of Iowans.","1642","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"
"Everything she’s doing communicates to them that they aren’t as important as they once were. It’s bound to get them angry and make them like her even less than they already do, which could make their coverage even harsher. And though like any politician she’d rather have friendlier coverage, at this point it looks like a bargain she’s more than willing to make.","1643","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/22/the-political-media-dont-like-hillary-clinton-but-what-if-she-doesnt-need-them/"

"When the Clinton campaign stirs and moves, it is the sound of a thousand focus groups buzzing, a thousand memos fluttering, a thousand consultants consulting, a thousand talking points repeated in singsong unison. It advances like a big push at the Second Battle of the Somme — idealism long gone, but grim duty remaining. The whistles blow along a vast line. Boots churn in mud. Over the top, boys. Over the top.","August 17","1645","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-political-mindset-on-full-display/2015/08/17/fc2b271a-4501-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"
"Hillary Clinton’s approach to politics has recently been on full display. After one of the worst campaign launches in recent history, many Democrats have been hoping for some type of reset from their front-runner — some hint of recognition that the current strategy might be a tad flawed. Instead, at the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding dinner , Clinton refused readjustment and launched a spirited attack on her Republican critics for engaging in “partisan games” and playing “politics with national security.” Minions fanned out to dismiss the whole e-mail business as “nonsense.”","1646","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-political-mindset-on-full-display/2015/08/17/fc2b271a-4501-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"
"How can we fault Hillary Clinton for adopting a strategy that has always worked for the Clintons before? On Whitewater. On suspicious commodity windfalls (involving a 10,000-percent profit in nine months). On bimbo eruptions. On the Lewinsky matter. Outfight them. Out-parse them. Out-brazen them. Outlast them.","1647","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-political-mindset-on-full-display/2015/08/17/fc2b271a-4501-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"
"But it turns out to be difficult to run a presidential campaign drained of idealism. Bill Clinton was the “man from Hope.” Hillary Clinton’s team is hoping that it fully erased a server to prevent FBI scrutiny. Such a novel and useful political lesson: Those who have their data professionally wiped have nothing to hide because there is nothing left to find. More than half of Americans do not describe Clinton as honest and trustworthy. The rest are not paying attention.","1648","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-political-mindset-on-full-display/2015/08/17/fc2b271a-4501-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"
"At least partially as a result, Clinton’s campaign is foundering without a serious opponent. And her unserious opponent — an actual, real-live socialist — is leading her in some New Hampshire polls. Bernie Sanders’s campaign is all idealism, of the Norman Thomas variety. If Clinton is offering ideological aspirin, Sanders is handing out crystal meth. The high for Democrats is incredible, and temporary.","1649","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-political-mindset-on-full-display/2015/08/17/fc2b271a-4501-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"
"The real source of nightmares for Clinton and her supporters must be the figure of 10 percent. Of the sample of 40 e-mails initially reviewed by the intelligence community’s inspector general, four were found to contain classified data. In the universe of 30,000 e-mails sent and received over four years by a secretary of state, hundreds or thousands of e-mails might attract scrutiny. And it only takes negligence in one case to violate some rather serious laws concerning the possession and transfer of classified materials.","1650","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-political-mindset-on-full-display/2015/08/17/fc2b271a-4501-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"
"The claim of a Republican political conspiracy involving the FBI and various inspectors general is not minimally credible. Everything that results from this scandal can be traced to one decision made by Clinton herself: to conduct most of her highly sensitive public business through a personal e-mail on a private Internet server. What lawyer — and Clinton is surrounded by sharp lawyers — would recommend such an arrangement? Wouldn’t legal alarm bells immediately begin ringing on compliance with the Federal Records Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the Espionage Act? And why, just as a matter of common sense, would an American secretary of state trust the defense of sensitive information against Chinese and Russian hackers to Platte River Networks?","1651","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-political-mindset-on-full-display/2015/08/17/fc2b271a-4501-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"
"This is a choice that reveals a mindset. Having suffered through decades of investigations, Clinton apparently wanted to take complete, personal control over her communications records, which she could release or destroy at her own discretion. But the method was so blinking obvious that it has invited scrutiny. Clinton apparently overlearned the lesson of Whitewater; as God is her witness, she would never be subpoenaed again. In trying too hard to control events, Clinton has lost control of events. Her political future may lie, once again, in the hands of investigators and prosecutors.","1652","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-political-mindset-on-full-display/2015/08/17/fc2b271a-4501-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"
"Nothing approaching criminal conduct has, at this point, been demonstrated. But Clinton stands accused of poor judgment, playing close to ethical lines and showing a streak of paranoia. Her actions raise comparisons to Richard Nixon — and not the skillful diplomacy part.","1653","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-political-mindset-on-full-display/2015/08/17/fc2b271a-4501-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"

"Vice President Biden is reportedly ruminating over a presidential run. One argument pro-Hillary Clinton Democrats have used is that in the past Biden has been a weak fundraiser. On its face, that’s terribly out of date, as he is now VP and is looked at very differently by donors and the public at large. But it has prompted Democrats clearly favoring Biden to send a very overt signal to the Clinton crowd.","August 26","1656","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/26/donors-sour-on-hillary-clinton/"
"The Post reports:","1657","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/26/donors-sour-on-hillary-clinton/"
"Take that, Hillary. If “there is growing unease among some of Obama’s biggest financial backers about the controversy over Clinton’s use of a private e-mail” and Biden “developed personal relationships with donors around the country as Obama’s running mate,” then money may not be as great a factor as one might think. Also, Clinton and her super PAC may be hamstrung in how they would use their money. A traditional super PAC role has been to attack the opponent in ways the candidate does not want to be seen directly. But attack the VP, who is wrestling with the death of his son? Even the Clinton crowd is not tone deaf.","1658","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/26/donors-sour-on-hillary-clinton/"
"Even if Biden does not run, the lack of support for Hillary Clinton is startling. (“Of the 770 fundraisers who bundled checks for Obama’s 2012 reelection, just 52 have signed on so far as a ‘Hillblazer’ bundler for Clinton or have hosted a fundraiser for her, according to a Washington Post analysis.”) This is the woman who spent years with many top Democratic donors, soliciting funds for her foundation and speaking to party elites (for a hefty sum). After all that, her potential donors won’t ask others for money and would even consider abandoning her altogether? Even more extraordinary is to see Democratic donors go on record. So much for the fear of the Clintons. She commands not much affection but even worse instills no fear.","1659","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/26/donors-sour-on-hillary-clinton/"
"Given truth serum, any candidate or presidential staffer will readily admit that donors want, above all else, a winner. Especially when there is little difference politically between Clinton and Biden (it’s not like one of them opposes abortion on demand or cap and trade) it boils down to the issue of electability. Donors read the public polls and maybe some non-public ones. They can see how badly she is now running in swing states against Republicans. They’d be foolish not to look for an alternative.","1660","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/26/donors-sour-on-hillary-clinton/"
"For Clinton, then, the Biden flurry is simply confirmation of what her critics have long suspected. Her support is wide but not deep with the base. The donor class likes her if she’s a sure thing but is panicking and not tied to her. That’s why the Biden run has become plausible.","1661","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/26/donors-sour-on-hillary-clinton/"

"In 2010, the then-GOP Senate nominee went all middle-school-cafeteria on her Democratic opponent’s hairdo. “God, what is that hair? Sooo yesterday,” Fiorina, already miked up, commented, quoting an aide’s assessment. Two years earlier, in the makeup room at ABC’s “This Week” with me, Fiorina said something that, at the time, was mildly interesting, but is now revelatory.

"The first female chief executive of a Fortune 100 company and an authorized surrogate for a presidential nominee does not count as an inexperienced source.

"At the time, Fiorina’s comments were surprising but not entirely outlandish. She and Clinton had been two prominent jousters at the glass ceiling. Fiorina was on a mission to woo Clinton voters for McCain. She was outspoken on issues of gender equity, questioning why many health plans covered erectile dysfunction drugs but not birth-control pills and, in the process, embarrassing her own candidate, who had voted twice against requiring insurers to cover contraceptives.","1671","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/carly-fiorinas-conversion-from-hillary-clinton-fan-to-fervent-critic/2015/08/14/fd23521a-42ad-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html"

"FORTY-FOUR senators in the Democratic caucus voted Tuesday to block action on a crucial “trade promotion authority” bill, delivering an embarrassing setback to President Obama, who strongly supports the bill — and, more importantly, sowing doubts about U.S. leadership among friends and foes around the world.

"As it happens, they are probably right, in part because there are still enough Democrats in the Senate (in addition to the one, Thomas R.

Still, it’s remarkable how much power the anti-trade left wing of the Democratic Party has come to wield within the Senate, which historically was a bastion of bipartisan pro-trade sentiment. Mr. Obama wants trade promotion authority — “fast-track” authority — to grease the legislative skids for his proposed ­Trans-Pacific Partnership, a measure that would enhance U.S. exports to Asia, as well as security ties to key nations such as Japan.

"The Post reports, “Hillary Rodham Clinton’s attorney has agreed to provide the FBI with the private server that housed her e-mail during her four years as secretary of state, Clinton’s presidential campaign said Tuesday. Her attorney has agreed to give agents a thumb drive containing copies of thousands of e-mails that Clinton had previously turned over to the State Department.” According to ex-law enforcement officials and criminal law attorneys experienced with investigations of high-profile individuals with whom we have spoken, this is a nice way of saying: The FBI allowed her to hand over the material instead of suffering the embarrassment of a subpoena. The Clinton campaign’s silence seems to confirm this is the case. (“Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said Tuesday night that Clinton is cooperating with the FBI probe. He declined to say whether the FBI ordered that she turn over the devices and when her attorney, David Kendall, had done so.”)","1689","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/12/hillary-clintons-al-capone-moment/"
"The Associated Press reports, “A day after Hillary Rodham Clinton turned her personal email server over to the Justice Department, her campaign assured supporters that the Democratic presidential candidate did not send classified information over her private account.” How Clintonian. This does not mean she did not possess such e-mails or that her receipt of these on an unsecured server was proper. Indeed this is where the plot thickens:","1690","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/12/hillary-clintons-al-capone-moment/"

"First, the investigation is being handled by the FBI, headed by widely-respected director James Comey. He has no reason to slow-walk an investigation or look the other way. Nor does he have an incentive to refrain from forensic investigation and, if need be, reconstruction of the server’s deleted e-mails. The last thing he or the FBI wants is the allegation that they helped Clinton cover her tracks.","1692","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/12/hillary-clintons-al-capone-moment/"
"Second, high level officials including Gen. (Ret.) David Petraeus and another former CIA director John Deutch were investigated for improper handling of classified materials. Petraeus was compelled to accept a plea deal. The Post also noted that Deutch in 1996, “resigned after it was discovered that he had stored highly classified documents on his home computer, which was connected to the Internet. After a criminal investigation, Deutch agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $5,000 fine. But before the prosecutors could file the papers in federal court, President Bill Clinton pardoned him on his last day in office.” I suppose President Obama could do the same for Hillary Clinton if it comes to that. As one former federal prosecutor put it to me, “How would it look if they prosecuted them and not her?”","1693","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/12/hillary-clintons-al-capone-moment/"
"There is something stunning that after all the Clinton escapades, the issue that might bring her down is her own paranoid penchant for control and secrecy. The substance of the e-mails that she destroyed may or may not prove to be damaging to her with regard to issues like Benghazi. But, as she always feared, once her e-mails are in others’ hands, the leaks will start and we may learn much more about Clinton than we ever have.","1694","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/12/hillary-clintons-al-capone-moment/"

"First, she generates as much enthusiasm as dental surgery. But don’t just take my word for it. A new poll from Democracy Corps and Women’s Voices, Woman Vote Action Fund shows that Clinton’s hopes rest with “the changing demographic reality of the new American electorate. Unmarried women, people of color, millennials—voters of the Rising American Electorate (RAE)—will make up a majority of voters for the first time in 2016.” But therein lies Hillary’s problem. “[Democrats’] base, specifically RAE voters and unmarried women, betray a huge disparity in interest and enthusiasm for participating in the 2016 elections compared to their more conservative counterparts. A 67 percent majority of non-RAE voters describe their level of interest in the highest terms (a ‘ten’ on a ten-point scale). Among RAE voters, this number drops to 48 percent. These voters demonstrate real doubts about the ability of the government to deliver on the change they need. The disparity in interest among Democratic base groups is a direct threat to their strategy, regardless of the outcome in 2016.”","1697","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/30/even-more-bad-news-for-hillary-clinton/"
"The candidate enjoying the most buzz from the Democratic base is not Hillary Clinton, but Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) The hero of the left, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) might not run, but she may add fuel to Sanders’ campaign. This week she “did not rule out the possibility of campaigning for the Vermont senator, nor would she comment on the prospect of supporting other Democratic candidates like former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley or presumptive front-runner Hillary Clinton.” If the Kennedys gave a lift in 2008 to the then-junior Senator from Illinois Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton, Warren could play the same role this time around. The logic is sound: If a candidate is going to rely on turning out the base, the party needs a base-pleasing choice that will generate excitement. Hillary Clinton does not appear to be it.","1698","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/30/even-more-bad-news-for-hillary-clinton/"
"Hillary Clinton’s next problem is that some key issues may be receding. Gay marriage is a potent motivator for the Democratic base. (“57 percent support allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry, 43 percent strongly support these unions.” according to the survey.). But provided the Republicans do not nominate someone suggesting it is possible to reverse or ignore the Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage, does the issue remain as motivating a factor for Democrats? Likewise, what if Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) or Jeb Bush — both advocates of immigration reform — get the nod. Do they blunt that wedge issue? It is interesting that so much of the poll relies on the assumption voters think Republicans are mean, scary people who want to take things away from them. If the GOP nominee breaks the mold, it’s not clear the negative campaign we all expect will work as well as it did against a Mitt Romney.","1699","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/30/even-more-bad-news-for-hillary-clinton/"
"And third, Hillary Clinton’s noxious sense of entitlement, cronyism and lack of transparency continue to dog her. When an MSNBC panel rips her for lying that she turned over “all” her work emails and says her private server was instead an attempt to evade Americans’ right to know what is going on in their government, it’s a sign things are not well for her. The Post tells us that the University of Missouri at Kansas City balked at Clinton’s $275,000 speaking fee. “So the school booked the next best option: her daughter, Chelsea.” Well, we know the family business — entitlement, trading on access, — is multigenerational. Chelsea Clinton, devoid of virtually any accomplishment independent of her parents got $65,000. For a 10-minute talk.","1700","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/30/even-more-bad-news-for-hillary-clinton/"
"In short, the Clinton family members (who routinely blur distinctions between public service, charitable giving, and speaking fees) are prime practitioners of elite maneuvering, access trading, and corporate cronyism. That continues to solidify Hillary Clinton as someone who really does not understand the problems of “everyday” Americans and perpetuates the “stacking the deck” problem she hypocritically complains about.

"Hillary Clinton has long been known as a cautious politician who leaned more toward methodical plodding than grand gestures. She launched her 2000 campaign for the Senate with a purposely low-key “listening tour.” As a senator, she cultivated a reputation as a workhorse who eschewed high-profile media appearances for the mundane work of writing legislation. Throughout, she staked out a place as a familiar kind of Democrat — a little more liberal on social issues, a little more conservative on foreign policy and national security — but nobody’s idea of an ideologically transformative figure.","June 5","1703","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/is-hillary-clinton-becoming-the-candidate-of-big-ideas/"

"It’s starting to look that way. When yesterday she proposed national automatic voter registration — registering all Americans to vote when they turn 18 unless they opt out — it surprised everyone. While universal registration isn’t an idea no one had thought of before, Clinton took a Democratic priority (expanding voting rights and boosting turnout) and advanced it with an ambitious, national plan that went beyond what most prominent Democrats had advocated before.","1705","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/is-hillary-clinton-becoming-the-candidate-of-big-ideas/"
"We saw something similar on immigration, where Clinton didn’t just support the Obama administration’s position on immigration but went beyond it, proposing that the parents of “DREAMers” be allowed to stay in the country legally. She also called for an end to the “era of mass incarceration,” an era her husband had no small part in creating. She has signaled an intention to go bold in the area of campaign finance, floating the idea of a Constitutional amendment to get so-called “dark money” out of politics (though she has not gone so far as to make formal proposal).","1706","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/is-hillary-clinton-becoming-the-candidate-of-big-ideas/"
"This kind of thing is surprising coming from Clinton, given that she’s the likely nominee of the incumbent party. Usually, a candidate in that position will propose a program that sounds like, “Let’s continue what we’ve been doing, but a little better.” Generally it’s the opposition party, which has had eight years to contemplate everything they dislike about current government policy, that’s more prone to come up with dramatic ideas for change. Not only that, the candidate pushing Big Ideas is often one struggling in the polls who is looking for a way to distinguish himself from the pack. You might expect some dramatic policy proposals from some of the lower-tiered Republican candidates.","1707","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/is-hillary-clinton-becoming-the-candidate-of-big-ideas/"
"Clinton, on the other hand, could easily ride to the Democratic nomination without putting out a single policy paper. But for now she’s taking a very different course. As a media strategy, it’s very effective: the less-than-threatening nature of her primary opposition gives her the freedom to put out big ideas and get attention for them; after a temporary drought of campaign activity, she can get plenty of coverage for a speech that includes a significant policy proposal.","1708","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/is-hillary-clinton-becoming-the-candidate-of-big-ideas/"
"To be sure, we shouldn’t exaggerate the extent to which the Clinton campaign is focused on big ideas. We’re only talking about a few so far, and there are other topics like the Trans-Pacific Partnership on which she’s been vague. Part of the explanation for Clinton’s previous cautious approach lies in the failure of Bill Clinton’s health care overhaul, which she ran during the early days of his presidency — and which would have been a much more radical change than the Affordable Care Act. Supposedly, the lesson she learned from that experience was that people fear change, and when you propose something too sweeping it’s difficult to succeed and easy to get burned.","1709","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/is-hillary-clinton-becoming-the-candidate-of-big-ideas/"

"And wouldn’t you know it, but that “State Department officials have uncovered 17,855 emails sent between a former Hillary Clinton spokesman and reporters that the agency long claimed did not exist. The trove was among more than 80,000 emails belonging to Philippe Reines, a Clinton aide, that were discovered on his State Department account, officials said in court filings Aug. 13.” One recalls the Rose law firm scandal 20 years ago when documents “disappeared” and then — just like that! — reappeared.","1732","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/18/hillary-clinton-should-stop-slandering-the-fbi/"
"Meanwhile, Clinton continues to decry the entire episode as mere partisanship. In her telling, it was all her idea to release the e-mails. This is bizarrely untrue; it was the House Select Committee on Benghazi that brought the home server to light. She no longer claims there were not confidential materials. Now she says, “But I never sent nor received any classified email, nothing marked ’Classified.'” That’s immaterial since she was responsible for knowing what materials are classified.","1733","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/18/hillary-clinton-should-stop-slandering-the-fbi/"
"Clinton’s strategy to make this seem like just another GOP witch hunt. She denounces the controversy as a “partisan game” and vows she “won’t get down in the mud with them. I won’t play politics with national security or dishonor the memory of those we lost.” But the “them” includes inspectors general in a Democratic administration and the FBI. Is she accusing them of corruption? Are they being bamboozled by Republicans? If she really believes this is the case, then she should make her case. And if she does not, then she — as someone who wants to lead the executive branch — should stop smearing law enforcement officials.","1734","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/18/hillary-clinton-should-stop-slandering-the-fbi/"

The probe is putting the nation’s top law enforcement agency at the center of a political battle leading into the 2016 election.” We’re not talking about Watergate era cronies of the president here. (“Comey has long shown an independent streak that’s gained him wide bipartisan praise and helped him sail to a 93-1 confirmation vote in the Senate.

"Instead, Clinton has gone on the offensive by finding humor in her fashion foibles and beauty regimen. Sometimes she takes up the shtick of her critics and makes it her own. Or she recognizes the joke and tells it before others have the chance.

(“Your hair will send significant messages to those around you,” she said, mockingly during a Class Day speech at Yale in 2001. “What hopes and dreams you have for the world, but more, what hopes and dreams you have for your hair.

"Clinton has done more than reach détente with fashion. Fashion is now working for her — as a pleasure, an aesthetic proposition, as well as a campaign symbol. After years of dabbling in Donna Karan and St. John Collection, contact lenses and headbands, skirts and millinery, she finally said “enough.” In 2012, while secretary of state, she faced the public in an official capacity without makeup and wearing her once-maligned eyeglasses. Observers commented and debated the professionalism of her appearance. She did not look bad, although she certainly appeared tired. She eschewed the standard accouterments of the female professional class. When asked about her natural look, she laughed and noted she’d reached a stage in life when she felt empowered to dress as she pleased. Not to flout civility and good manners, but to make choices that more honestly represented her. Indeed, admitting that she had made a considered decision about her appearance — and decided to ignore all the unwritten rules — was a kind of victory for personal style in the political realm.","1814","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/06/16/hillary-clinton-is-owning-the-joke-about-her-fashion-choices-and-its-working/"
"Clinton is now using her much-discussed and undiminished love of a brightly colored pantsuit as a fundraising device. From her Senate campaign to her first presidential race, she has made cracks about her affection for the practical ensemble.

"The cracks about her pantsuits framed her as a no-frills, serious-minded politician with a uniform — albeit one that came in every color of the rainbow.

"The idea -- I guess -- was that if Clinton put her gender at the forefront of the campaign, voters (especially male voters) would wonder if she was ""up"" to the job. (Whatever the heck that means.) That judgment, blamed on strategist Mark Penn but ultimately followed by Hillary, led to a Democratic primary campaign in which she was cast as the status quo while then-Sen.

"What's amazing about that decision was that as far back as 2007, Clinton's most appealing trait to voters was the fact that she would have been the first woman ever elected president; in Gallup polling at the time, 22 percent said the historic nature of her candidacy was the single most appealing part of her bid -- more than double the share who named any other character trait.","1983","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/15/hillary-clinton-finally-figured-out-how-to-talk-about-being-a-woman-in-presidential-politics/"

As we've written before in this space, presidential elections are almost always about the future and the candidate best able to present himself or herself as the right choice to lead the country into that future. Hillary's problem is that so much of who she is -- and so much of the strengths she carries as a candidate -- are rooted in the past. If and when she, at 67 and having spent the last two decades in the national spotlight, has to run against someone like Marco Rubio (age 43), it is going to be a real challenge for her to win the ""future vs. past"" argument.","1987","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/15/hillary-clinton-finally-figured-out-how-to-talk-about-being-a-woman-in-presidential-politics/"

Others in the party want market-based policies, including teacher evaluations based partly on student test scores, the expansion of charter schools, merit pay, and weakening of tenure rules and seniority protections.","2040","https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/hillary-clinton-makes-a-promise-to-union-leaders-ill-listen-to-teachers/2015/06/08/f699ac86-0e10-11e5-adec-e82f8395c032_story.html"

"It’s been a while since we looked deeply at the controversy surrounding Clinton’s e-mails while she was secretary of state, but her recent statements to CNN provide a new opportunity.","2047","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"In some ways, her remarks, when questioned on her “e-mail practices,” remind The Fact Checker of then-Vice President Al Gore’s statement in 1997 that there was “no controlling legal authority” concerning his phone calls from the White House seeking Democratic campaign contributions.","2048","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"Here, Clinton claims that “everything I did was permitted” because “there was no law … there was no regulation.” So is that really the case?","2049","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"As we have noted before, in our timeline of regulations related to the controversy, the legal requirement to immediately preserve e-mails from nongovernment e-mail accounts was not made mandatory until nearly two years after she stepped down as secretary of state.","2050","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"In 2014, President Obama signed an update of the 1950 Presidential and Federal Records Act. That law expanded the definition of “federal records” to specifically include electronic communications and clarified the responsibilities of federal government officials when they use nongovernment e-mail systems. The responsibilities include copying an official record, such as an e-mail, or forwarding a complete copy of the e-mail within 20 days of transmission.","2051","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"But that does not mean that, when Clinton was secretary of state, there were not already in place State Department rules on how to handle e-mails and whether to use a personal e-mail account. While Clinton says that other secretaries “did the same thing,” none had set up an exclusive and private e-mail server for all of their departmental communications. (In fact, only Colin L. Powell has ever said he sent e-mails from a personal account, so Clinton’s use of plural is misleading.)","2052","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"The rules also quickly became clearer. In 2009, just eight months after Clinton became secretary of state, the U.S. Code of federal regulations on handling electronic records was updated: “Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record-keeping system.” The responsibility for making and preserving the records is assigned to “the head of each federal agency.”","2053","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"On top of that, when Clinton was secretary, a cable went out under her signature warning employees to “avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.”","2054","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"The issue thus becomes whether Clinton cooperated in the spirit of the laws and rules in place at the time. Clinton suggests that “when I mailed anybody in the government, it would go into the government system” and so that signified compliance with the requirement to maintain federal records. But her practice made it difficult to locate records in response to specific requests, because Clinton’s e-mail would be in another official’s inbox — but would not exist in the federal system as part of Clinton’s outbox. An official’s outbox would be the first place that people seeking records would look.","2055","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"

"Interestingly, the section of the Foreign Affairs Manual highlighted by Clinton’s staff now directs people to an interim directive that was issued in mid-October 2014, at about the time the State Department formally requested that Clinton provide copies of the e-mails on her private server.","2059","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"

"Indeed, well before this directive was issued — and before Clinton joined the Obama administration — the Foreign Affairs Manual made it clear that before a senior official (such as a Senate-confirmed presidential appointee) departs government service, he or she must prepare an inventory of personal papers that are proposed for removal. The manual states that “correspondence or e-mail received or sent in an employee’s capacity as a Department official is not personal.”","2061","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"Clinton certainly failed to live up to that requirement, as she had retained those e-mail records for nearly two years after she left office before returning them to the State Department. The Clinton campaign suggests she could determine what actually was a federal record, but her State Department-related emails did not fall in that category.","2062","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"With her very careful language, Clinton skirts some of the important issues concerning her private e-mail account. She appears to be arguing her case on narrow, technical grounds, but that’s not the same as actually complying with existing rules as virtually everyone else understood them.","2063","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"
"In reality, Clinton’s decision to use a private e-mail system for official business was highly unusual and flouted State Department procedures, even if not expressly prohibited by law at the time. Moreover, while she claims “everything I did was permitted,” she appears to have not complied with the requirement to turn over her business-related e-mails before she left government service. That’s a major misstep that she has not acknowledged.","2064","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-everything-i-did-on-emails-was-permitted/"

"A poll released Sunday from NBC/Marist reinforces one from last week by Quinnipiac University that found her to be as unpopular as Donald Trump in key swing states.

If you look at it since 2006, when she was widely expected to be the 2008 Democratic nominee, to today, you can see that trend.","2076","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/26/why-is-hillary-clinton-viewed-so-unfavorably-in-early-primary-states/"

"Part of that may be related to those numbers on white/non-white approvals. Iowa is about 93 percent white, per 2013 Census estimates. New Hampshire is 94 percent white. (By comparison, Colorado is 88 percent white, while Virginia is 71 percent. The country, on the whole, is about 77.7 percent white.)

"The similarity between Clinton's position in this race and where she was in 2007 is that she remains the ""head"" candidate in the field while someone else (Obama then, Sanders now) is the ""heart"" candidate. Voters don't dislike Clinton — they like her! But, they don't love her. They feel obligated at some level to be for her because (a) she's got a massively deep resume, (b) she's a Clinton and (c) there's still a widespread belief she will win the primary.","2116","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/31/iowa-voters-like-hillary-clinton-but-they-dont-love-her-thats-the-problem-again/"

"Remember that Obama circa 2007 had all of the passion that Sanders is inspiring right now and he had money and an organization that was already lapping Clinton in Iowa. (Side note: Paul Tewes, who ran the Iowa caucuses for Obama in 2008, doesn't get enough credit for his role in launching Obama into the national stratosphere.)

Since July, Trump has seen an increase in how many people view him favorably, while Bush has seen a big jump in the number who view him unfavorably. (These figures are all for registered voters.)

"Notice how the Republicans' fates differ. Clinton is actually doing better against Bush than in July, thanks to his having grown more unpopular. Walker grew more unpopular since July, too -- but less so than Clinton, so he improved in polling against her.

More than a million people attend each year to inspect hundreds of farm animals, listen to live music, ride the Ferris wheel, play games on the midway, have a couple beers or eat several days worth of calories in one meal. The food is a hallmark of the state fair, and this year there are nearly 200 booths competing to take fried delicacies -- especially fried food on a stick, with bonus points for the inclusion of bacon -- to new culinary heights. Menus include deep-fried nacho balls, bacon-wrapped smokies on a stick, deep-fried Twinkies, a double-bacon corn dog, pumpkin-spice funnel cake and something ominously called an ""Ultimate Bacon Brisket Bomb.""

"Trump and Clinton had already opted out of appearing at the soapbox, a beloved state fair tradition: an opportunity for presidential hopefuls to share their vision for the future of the nation with fair-goers -- and get mercilessly heckled. The risk is high. After all, the soapbox is where former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2011 made the ""corporations are people"" comment, a damaging gaffe that followed him to the election. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) took the soapbox challenge as he visited the fair on Friday and was endlessly pelted with questions about the legacy of the two former presidents in his family and the Iraq war.","2183","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/15/latest-iowa-state-fair-attraction-trump-clinton-sanders-and-a-helicopter/"

"Carville's argument is simple: I am dumb and wrong. In particular, he takes issue with the piece I wrote Tuesday raising the possibility that Hillary Clinton might just not be that good a candidate. In it, I use the phrase ""full-scale Democratic freakout"" to describe the worries among many Democrats about how her campaign has gone thus far. Those words are hyperlinked to a story by The Post's Anne Gearan, Karen Tumulty and Dan Balz that ran Monday with the headline, ""Backers fear old weaknesses stalk Clinton campaign.""","2191","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/james-carville-thinks-i-am-an-idiot-when-it-comes-to-hillary-clinton/"
"Anne, Karen and Dan aren't the only ones to write a story about the hand-wringing going on in the Democratic Party at the moment. Politico's Annie Karni wrote a piece on Wednesday titled ""Allies fault Hillary Clinton's response on e-mails.""

"Carville's response to that fact is almost certainly: So what? More reporters writing bad stories doesn't tell you anything about anything. And it certainly doesn't prove that Clinton is in any political danger from these e-mail stories or that the fretting of a handful of Democrats means anything in the larger scope of the race. ""Stupid media people talking to other stupid media people” is how Carville put it in his TV interview Wednesday.","2193","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/james-carville-thinks-i-am-an-idiot-when-it-comes-to-hillary-clinton/"

"1. Yes, I quote a few unnamed strategists in my piece. But the characterization Carville uses of ""a guy who talked to a guy"" is not right. The people I quoted in my piece are top-level Democratic Party strategists with absolutely no ax to grind against Clinton. These are not minor players. They are major players. And I also quote Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Obama, on the record in the piece as saying that Hillary Clinton is like Scottie Pippen to Bill Clinton's and Barack Obama's Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson.","2196","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/james-carville-thinks-i-am-an-idiot-when-it-comes-to-hillary-clinton/"
"2. James doesn't get to decide what is credible and not credible as it relates to worries within the Democratic Party about Clinton. He might well think none of the hubbub about the e-mail server matters at all. And he might be right. But just because he and the people he talks to don't think it's a big deal doesn't mean no one except stupid people have real worries about Clinton's handling of this story and her candidacy more broadly. Perhaps the people he talks to about Clinton's issues aren't as candid with such a well-known Clinton adviser is they are with a journalist offering them anonymity.","2197","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/james-carville-thinks-i-am-an-idiot-when-it-comes-to-hillary-clinton/"
"3. Nowhere in my piece or the one that Anne, Karen and Dan wrote is there any insinuation that any of this is a death blow for Clinton's candidacy. His argument is that if the Clinton problems are so major, then why is she ahead of every Republican in the polls. To which I would say: (a) she is better known than almost every Republican at this point, (b) he knows full well the key to understanding polling is not any individual survey but the broader trend lines that become apparent over time. And those trend lines are unmistakably moving in the wrong direction for Clinton.","2198","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/james-carville-thinks-i-am-an-idiot-when-it-comes-to-hillary-clinton/"
"That does not mean she is in serious danger of losing the Democratic nomination. (She's not.) It doesn't even mean that she won't be elected president next November. She very well might be. All it means is that, at the moment, Clinton is struggling to get herself extricated from this e-mail story, and the aggregate of polling suggests it is hurting her image with voters.","2199","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/19/james-carville-thinks-i-am-an-idiot-when-it-comes-to-hillary-clinton/"

"1. The vast majority of the people who have asked Clinton questions in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada were part of a pre-selected group who sat with her around a roundtable. That's not exactly like hosting a town hall event in which none of the questions are pre-screened. And if you look at the questions ""regular"" people are asking Clinton, they are not exactly the most probing of queries. A sampling: ""I’m just wondering, what can you do to bring that heart back to education in the United States?"" (Iowa), ""What are your plans to help my community and help us not live in fear anymore?"" (Nevada) and ""I would like you to elaborate on what you think you might do for childcare in the future if you’re elected?"" (New Hampshire) None of those questions are bad, per se, but they also aren't pushing Clinton in any way, shape or form on any issue.","2219","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/18/you-wont-believe-hillary-clintons-spin-on-avoiding-the-press/"

If those people were running for president, then I would be super-interested to know how they responded to some (or maybe all) of Clinton's 117 questions. But, they aren't. She is. Citing the number of questions Clinton has asked of people to rebut the idea that she isn't taking enough (or any) questions from reporters is sort of like saying you aced a job interview because you answered every question asked of you with another question.

"3. At issue here is that Clinton is avoiding taking questions from reporters. And nowhere in the Correct The Record memo does it have anything to dispute that fact. In total as a candidate, Clinton has answered 13 total questions from reporters. It's been 39,000 minutes since she last answered a reporter's question. And, while I think it is absolutely of value for Clinton to hear from regular folks about their concerns and hopes, it's hard to argue from the list put together by Correct The Record that the questions those people have asked Clinton are the same as the one reporters would have if given the chance.","2221","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/18/you-wont-believe-hillary-clintons-spin-on-avoiding-the-press/"

"The data come a long 14 months from the general election and before either party picks its nominee — Clinton is looking less likely to be the Democratic nominee than before and Trump more likely as the GOP one — but they demonstrate the power of partisanship, which bring the less-popular Trump into a once-unthinkable position of nipping at Clinton's heels.","2304","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"

"The vote shifts between adults and voters are small and generally within the poll's margin of error. But the shifts in the marginal results are most apparent among political independents. Clinton has a very narrow advantage among all independents, at 45-39 — a six-point difference that is within the poll's error margin.

"Likewise, Trump gets 73 percent support from all Republicans and 76 percent for registered Republicans. Trump's overwhelming partisan support indicates Republicans are willing to rally against Clinton even while having reservations about Trump. Nearly 4-in-10 Republicans had an unfavorable impression of Trump in a separate Post-ABC poll last week; only half as many Democrats held negative impressions of Clinton in that survey — 18 percent.","2310","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-now-running-neck-and-neck-with-hillary-clinton/"

"Here's how much that 9/11 answer mattered: CBS turned to Twitter -- live -- and plucked out a question raised by someone in Iowa. This was no snarky one-liner. It was, unlike so many attempts to allegedly engage the young people on social media, a moment full of substance. It was provided by an American who might cast a vote, moments after Clinton tried to tell the country that Wall Street donations don't matter in a most unfortunate way.","2365","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-invoked-911-to-defend-her-ties-to-wall-street-what/"

"Gefilte fish, for those unaware, is a quintessentially Jewish food made of ground white fish, onion, egg whites, and a few other things. It's eaten primarily on Passover, sometimes served over a bed of lettuce, and often can be found hours after it's served, still untouched at the table, sitting idly in front of family members who care not for its moist, gelatinous fishiness. The reason it's so frequently devoured with horseradish, some argue, is because it's the only way one can stand the taste.","2371","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/01/the-story-behind-the-funniest-e-mail-hilary-clinton-has-ever-sent/"
"But the thing about gefilte fish is that for every person who hates it, there is another who adores it — or at least understands it. Gefilte fish gets a bad rap, food writer Lisa Bramen wrote in Smithsonian in 2010. What stands in between the mushy footballs of fish and eager eater's stomachs is a better name, she says. ""How about poisson à la juive, or ""fish in the Jewish style,"" as it's called in French?""","2372","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/01/the-story-behind-the-funniest-e-mail-hilary-clinton-has-ever-sent/"

"It's hard not to find this e-mail funny, because gefilte fish is nothing if not funny. Also, to be fair, ""where are we on this"" could mean so many things without context. So many amusing things.

"But the reality is that there seems to be a much more substantive explanation for why the leading Democratic presidential candidate sent an e-mail with gefilte fish in the subject line while she was serving as secretary of state. That year, ahead of the Jewish holiday, a rather large shipment of frozen fish was held on its way from the United States to Israel. The fish was carp, the kind traditionally used to make gefilte fish, it was farmed in Illinois, and it was going to be hit with an 120 percent import duty unless an exception was made.","2377","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/01/the-story-behind-the-funniest-e-mail-hilary-clinton-has-ever-sent/"

"“There seems no question that Hillary is a sincere, committed Christian and has been since childhood,” Kengor writes in “God and Hillary Clinton,” which was published in 2007. “Hillary is a very liberal Christian, and would be categorized as part of the religious left, along with millions of Christian Americans — a designation that appears to have disappeared from the media’s lexicon now that the secular press is obsessed with fears over the religious right.”","2446","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/09/13/hillary-clinton-showed-up-for-church-today-will-faith-help-or-hurt-her-on-the-campaign/"

"A number of readers have asked questions about Clinton’s assertion that 90 to 95 percent of the e-mails were in the State Department system. On several occasions, especially in the evening session of the 11-hour hearing, Clinton suggested this figure came from the State Department. (For instance: “The State Department was beginning to turn over to this committee my e-mails because they had between 90 and 95 percent of all my work-related e-mails in the State Department system.”)","2460","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"

"First of all, the State Department is correct. The “90 to 95 percent” figure comes from the Clinton campaign. There has never been a calculation made by the State Department of the 55,000 pages of the e-mails provided by Clinton from her private e-mail account. So Clinton got that wrong.","2464","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"“Of the more than 30,000 e-mails that Secretary Clinton provided to the State Department last year, more than 90 percent were sent to or from a state.gov e-mail address,” a Clinton campaign spokesman said. “That is observable by looking at the e-mails that were provided for release by the department. These messages would have been captured in the State Department’s record system. It has since been learned that the State Department’s archiving system did not maintain every e-mail, but that does not change that these messages were captured by State’s system and thus should have been available.”","2465","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"Let’s unpack that statement. Essentially, Clinton’s lawyers looked through the e-mails and found that at least one person in the e-mail chain — either sending an e-mail to Clinton or receiving it — had a state.gov e-mail address. So in theory, if a search was requested of the e-mails of person who corresponded with Clinton, Clinton’s e-mails would have shown up.","2466","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"This is how Clinton has explained this in past, minus the assertion that it was a State Department calculation. Here’s a comment from Sept. 20 on CBS’s “Face the Nation:”","2467","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"The Clinton campaign, in a Q&A on the e-mail controversy, worded it even more carefully:","2468","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"The problem is, of course, that a requested search of Clinton’s e-mails would have turned up nothing, because she did not maintain a state.gov account. That’s why the State Department had trouble finding her e-mails in response to congressional and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests in the first place.","2469","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"But it’s also not unreasonable for Clinton to assert that most of these e-mails resided somewhere in the State Department’s systems. Gowdy referenced an 2015 inspector general’s report concerning poor e-mail retention at the State Department, but that report concerned the e-mails of lower-level officials, under a system known as SMART (State Messaging and Archive Retrieval Toolset). A footnote in the report makes that clear: “These assessments do not apply to the system used by the Department’s high-level principals, the Secretary, the Deputy Secretaries, the Under Secretaries, and their immediate staffs, which maintain separate systems.” (A statement from the National Archives also emphasizes that high-level memos are not captured by SMART.)","2470","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"What systems are used to capture high-level communications? There are actually four that track the records of the Office of the Secretary of State, according to the State Department:","2471","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"So, when the State Department received a request for e-mails concerning 2012 Benghazi attacks, officials used those systems to search the records of three people who were closest to Clinton then: Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan and Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, according to a declaration filed in federal court by John F. Hackett, director of the Office of Information Programs and Services, concerning a lawsuit by Judicial Watch. Officials searched their records for terms containing words such as “ambassador,” “attack,” “Benghazi,” “Libya” and “talking points.” Any document that contained these terms would be returned as possibly responsive to a FOIA request.","2472","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"This search turned up four documents. After the State Department obtained Clinton’s e-mails on her personal server, the same criteria was used to search them and no documents were deemed relevant. Interestingly, after the department asked Mills, Sullivan and Abedin to search their personal e-mails, Hackett said that one of Sullivan’s personal e-mails helped officials realize that a Clinton e-mail previously deemed as not relevant actually concerned the infamous Benghazi talking points. But that wasn’t previously clear in the e-mail chain contained in Clinton’s records. (Sullivan had not forwarded that part of the message to Clinton.)","2473","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"Under FOIA, agencies are not necessarily expected to find every record; rather, they are expected to produce records based on a “reasonable search” of what’s in its custody and control at the time. So at the State Department, FOIA searches are generally custodian-based, which means that individuals and offices are tasked with FOIA requests. Each custodian is responsible for producing any responsive records they have — regardless of medium (e-mail, paper or other electronic records). Since the Clinton e-mail issue emerged, though, the State Department says it is now automatically preserving the records of Secretary of State John F. Kerry and his senior aides.","2474","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"Clinton clearly erred in saying that the “90 to 95 percent” figure was from the State Department. This is her own staff’s calculation, and she should correct the record.","2475","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"
"While not all of the e-mails she submitted to the State Department have been released, what has been made available so far suggests that a substantial majority are to and from at least one “state.gov” e-mail address. It is not an unreasonable assumption that these e-mails are contained somewhere within the bowels of the State Department. But Clinton cannot make a definitive statement and certainly cannot attribute that to the State Department.","2476","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/09/hillary-clintons-claim-that-90-percent-of-her-emails-were-in-the-system/"

Leonnig: “A federal watchdog on Thursday sent the U.S. Secret Service a formal warning that its overworking of employees is jeopardizing security — citing the discovery that two Secret Service officers were asleep at their posts, according to three government officials familiar with the findings. The inspector general who oversees the Secret Service issued a management alert, a formal designation that indicates investigators have found a problem so urgent or sweeping that it requires swift attention from senior management. ‘This alert describes officer safety issues that may pose an immediate or potential danger to U.S. Secret Service officers and those whom they protect,’ the inspector general’s alert says. ‘We are concerned that the Secret Service’s staffing and scheduling process does not ensure that officers receive adequate breaks while on duty and time off between shifts.'”","2505","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/23/the-daily-202-eight-reasons-why-hillary-clinton-won-the-benghazi-hearing/"

The three-week gathering, known as a synod, has erupted into a theological slugfest over Pope Francis’s vision for a more inclusive church, displaying the most bitter and public infighting since the heady days of Catholic reform in the 1960s … It was just another day at a synod that — more than any single event since Francis began his papacy in 2013 — has highlighted the extent his outreach to once-scorned Catholics has triggered a tug-of-war for the soul of the Catholic Church. More important, it underscored just how hard it may be for the pontiff to recast the church he serves in his image.”","2506","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/23/the-daily-202-eight-reasons-why-hillary-clinton-won-the-benghazi-hearing/"

On Twitter, debate coverage dominated any chatter about Benghazi. On debate night, there were more than 600,000 mentions of HRC on Twitter. On Thursday, there were about 365,000 tweets. On debate day, a majority of Clinton’s social media mentions referenced the Vegas confab; on Thursday, 36 percent of the Tweets talked about Benghazi.

In a speech this week about the boundaries between church and state, Dallin Oaks, a high-ranking apostle in the church, said that public officials like Ms. Davis, the clerk in Rowan County, Ky., had a duty to follow the law, despite their religious convictions … ‘Office holders remain free to draw upon their personal beliefs and motivations and advocate their positions in the public square,’ Elder Oaks said. ‘But when acting as public officials, they are not free to apply personal convictions, religious or other, in place of the defined responsibilities of their public offices. All government officers should exercise their civil authority according to the principles and within the limits of civil government.'”","2530","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/23/the-daily-202-eight-reasons-why-hillary-clinton-won-the-benghazi-hearing/"

Nerves frayed at the White House after senior officials learned Israeli aircraft had flown in and out of Iran in what some believed was a dry run for a commando raid on the site. Worried that Israel might ignite a regional war, the White House sent a second aircraft carrier to the region and readied attack aircraft, a senior U.S. official said, ‘in case all hell broke loose’ … Instead of talking to each other, the allies kept their intentions secret. To figure out what they weren’t being told, they turned to their spy agencies to fill gaps … U.S. and Israeli officials say they want to rebuild trust but acknowledge it won’t be easy. Mr. Netanyahu reserves the right to continue covert action against Iran’s nuclear program, said current and former Israeli officials, which could put the spy services of the U.S. and Israel on a collision course.”","2531","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/23/the-daily-202-eight-reasons-why-hillary-clinton-won-the-benghazi-hearing/"

Lindsey Graham (“very sad”). He also said he intended to tone down his rhetoric as the campaign enters a new phase: “You know, before, we had 17 people (running) and we were all out there fighting and I had people out there hitting me,” he said, adding that now “we’re so far out in front that there’s no reason to be quite the way we were, and I do want to tone it down a little bit, but at the same time I don’t want to lose the energy.”","2532","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/23/the-daily-202-eight-reasons-why-hillary-clinton-won-the-benghazi-hearing/"

"Obama, one of the savviest consumers and participants in the new world of political media, knows exactly what he is doing here. So why did he do it? Because he (a) didn't know about the e-mail server, (b) wants to make clear he didn't approve of it and (c) is generally uninterested in spending lots of his time in the final year of his presidency defending Clinton on something he thinks she shouldn't have done.","2565","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/12/president-obamas-lukewarm-defense-of-hillary-clinton-on-the-e-mail-controversy/"

"If there’s one thing you’d think the events of the last few weeks might accomplish, it’s to get Republicans to reconsider whether beating Hillary Clinton in 2016 will be the cakewalk they apparently have been expecting. Clinton has posted strong fundraising numbers. Joe Biden has pulled out. A Bernie Sanders upset is looking increasingly unlikely. Clinton held her own, and then some, for half a day in last week’s Benghazi hearing. The credibility of the GOP investigations has been damaged. Republican probe ringleaders may be reconsidering their focus on her emails.","October 26","2568","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/26/morning-plum-republicans-are-in-denial-about-hillary-clinton/"

"A new report from Mark Halperin supplies the answer: Yes, they do. Halperin concludes that Republicans are “in denial” about Clinton’s various 2016 advantages.","2570","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/26/morning-plum-republicans-are-in-denial-about-hillary-clinton/"
"Halperin describes those advantages as follows: the Clinton team is far more competent than in 2008. She may wrap up the nomination early, while the eventual GOP nominee will be bloodied by a very long and bitter process. Clinton is a formidable debater. Clinton will have a demographic edge. Some of the positions Clinton is taking now may have majority support in a general election (a point your humble blogger has made as well).","2571","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/26/morning-plum-republicans-are-in-denial-about-hillary-clinton/"
"But one of the most important advantages Clinton may have, according to Halperin, is the quality of Republican thinking about the 2016 election:","2572","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/26/morning-plum-republicans-are-in-denial-about-hillary-clinton/"
"I find it hard to imagine that the smarter GOP strategists really believe all this. But if this is the prevailing Republican theory of the 2016 election, there is precedent for it. In 2012, it often seemed as if Romney campaign officials’ assessments of the election were shaped by a tendency to believe their own superficial, GOP-base-friendly talking points about Obama. The Romney campaign convinced itself that there was no way Obama could possibly get reelected amid such high unemployment. The Romney camp convinced itself that there was no way the 2012 electorate could possibly be as diverse as it had been in 2008. Obama’s election was best explained as a fluke — his cult of personality had captivated nonwhite and young voters, but that would prove as fleeting as a high-school crush. There was no way swing voters in 2012 could possibly see the Obama presidency as anything other than an irredeemable catastrophe, since Republicans knew, just knew, that’s what it had been. Something similar might be happening now.","2573","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/26/morning-plum-republicans-are-in-denial-about-hillary-clinton/"
"To be clear, we don’t know if Clinton will have the advantage next year. As it is the election is probably close to a 50-50 proposition based on the fundamentals. There could be new revelations about her email arrangement; the economy could dip; Republicans may nominate an unexpectedly strong candidate; Sanders could still pull off an upset; and so forth. But, presuming Halperin is right, what remains striking is the absolute certainty among Republicans that Clinton can’t possibly win, because they see how distasteful and scandal-ridden a figure she truly is, and swing voters will just have to see it their way, because it’s so obvious to them.","2574","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/26/morning-plum-republicans-are-in-denial-about-hillary-clinton/"

"Dowd asked: “So, if she was talking to a Marine recruiter in 1975 before the marriage, was she briefly considering joining the few, the proud and the brave of the corps as an alternative to life with Mr. Clinton, who was already being widely touted as a sure thing for Arkansas Attorney General?”","2808","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"

"(Update: A former Marine lawyer, who was actively recruiting for the JAG at the time, says it is “ludicrous” to suggest someone with Clinton’s skills would have been rejected. Since the draft had ended, “we were frantic for lawyers,” he said, declining to be identified. Neither age nor eyesight would have been issue, he added. Many of the newly recruited lawyers were at least 26 years old and eyesight was only an issue for pilots, he said. Some lawyers he worked with had glasses the “size of Coke bottles.” Another Marine lawyer, who served between 1973 and 1978, confirmed this account, saying that one of the Marine lawyers he served with was a woman who weighed 200 pounds. “They desperately needed lawyers,” he said.)","2810","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"

"Yet our former colleague David von Drehle reported that Clinton’s friends at the time “confirmed the story, though they were hazy on the details.” Diane Blair, who passed away in 2000, told von Drehle, “All I can remember is that she looked into it.”","2812","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"
"Another friend, then University of Arkansas professor Ann Henry, said she recalled the incident happened in the context of the lack of opportunity for women. Sometimes female faculty members went out to conduct “tests” of access to various careers seemingly closed to women, Henry told von Drehle.","2813","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"
"Reached by phone after Clinton’s latest remarks, the now-retired Henry said that she still recalls the discussion about testing the limits. She said conversations grew out of the state’s Commission on the Status of Women, which was created in 1971 and chaired by Blair, then known as Diane Kincaid. Henry said there were Marine recruiting offices on campus, and so Clinton could have easily stopped by one to conduct such a test.","2814","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"
"But would women at the time need to test the Marines? Women have been part of the Marines since 1918, and were deployed to Korea in the 1950s. “By the height of the Vietnam war, there were about 2,700 women Marines served [sic.] both stateside and overseas,” according to the Women Marines Association. “By 1975, the Corps approved the assignment of women to all occupational fields except infantry, artillery, armor and pilot/air crew.”","2815","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"
"In fact, when Clinton first told this story in 1994, a Marine spokesman felt compelled to issue this statement: “We won’t attempt to dispute the first lady’s recollection, but if she was ill-treated by a Marine recruiter in 1975, it certainly is unfortunate, unprofessional and a mistake we regret.”","2816","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"
"Complicating matters is that in 2008, Bill Clinton told an audience that his future wife tried to join the Army. “I remember when we were young, right out of law school, she went down and tried to join the Army and they said ‘Your eyes are so bad, nobody will take you,'” he said.","2817","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"

"As far as we can tell, the only time a journalist quizzed Clinton about this incident was in 2007, when Michael Crowley wrote a profile for The New Republic. In a brief interview, he asked what should people make of the fact that she had briefly tried to enlist in the military. He wrote: “At this her eyes narrowed and she threw me a glare of mistrust. ‘I have very deep and quite broad relationships with people in the military,’ she said. As for the meaning of the recruiting visit, ‘I can’t tell you,’ she said with a dismissive wave. ‘You go look at that.'”","2819","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"
"A campaign spokesman initially did not offer a comment but on the evening of Nov. 12, spokesman Nick Merrill issued a statement appearing to take issue with the recollections of her friends.

"At first glance, this story doesn’t really add up, for the reasons that Dowd initially outlined. But as we noted The Post did locate friends who recalled she had tried to join the Marines, though the circumstances are fuzzy.","2821","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"
"Clinton suggests she simply decided to join the Marines, as part of way to serve the country. But it makes more sense that she approached the Marines as part of a deliberate effort to test the boundaries available to women, especially given her documented antiwar activities.","2822","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"
"As Ben Carson can attest, memories can get hazy after 40 years (or even 21 years). There are enough holes here that Clinton has an obligation to address the circumstances under which she approached the Marines, now that she had once again raised it in a campaign context.","2823","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"
"So far, we do not have enough documentary proof to say the incident never happened, such as supposedly landing under sniper fire in Bosnia or getting the date wrong for hearing a speech by Martin Luther King Jr. (Both of these were written by Michael Dobbs, who originated The Fact Checker during the 2008 campaign.) This is simply a personal recollection — one that at least two friends have confirmed they had been told about at the time.","2824","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/"

"Part of the shift in support for Clinton might be due to the decline in her net favorability among blacks. Opinions of Clinton have dropped among all Democrats as we've seen before.

"Then, Clinton was more skittish about playing up her gender. Not that she didn’t mention it — she did.

"“Most voters in essence see the president as the ‘father’ of the country.

"Even in 2008, the “ready for a female president” question felt antiquated, a fusty reflex. Yet the years since then have brought social change that further eases the path to a woman in the Oval Office. Voters have absorbed — or not — another first in the form of President Obama.

"“The problems for women candidates is they have to show they have the standing and gravitas to fight with the big boys in Washington, but they also have to be a human being,” said Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg. “Hillary doesn’t have to prove the stature stuff anymore and so that liberates her.”","2867","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-liberated-campaign/2015/10/16/8a0c3aea-7425-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Liberated she is — stylistically and substantively. Issues of pay equity and work-family balance that were notably — some advisers think mistakenly — subdued in the 2008 campaign are at the center of her platform today.

"The 2016 Clinton campaign has no doubt that gender benefits Clinton. The single-digit slice of voters who say they would not elect a woman are not Clinton supporters in any event, in the campaign’s view, and are outweighed by the facts that women voters make up more than a majority of the electorate and tend to vote more heavily Democratic.","2869","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-liberated-campaign/2015/10/16/8a0c3aea-7425-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Thus, Clinton Unbound was on full display during last week’s debate. The coda of her opening statement was a reference to what would be the historic nature of her election: “Yes, finally fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president.” Twice when confronted with tough questions, Clinton deflected by invoking her gender.","2870","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-liberated-campaign/2015/10/16/8a0c3aea-7425-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"Clinton engaged in a similar diversion on why Democrats, in the year of the outsider, should embrace the ultimate insider: “Well, I can’t think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president” — although she went on to say that was not the rationale for her run.","2872","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-liberated-campaign/2015/10/16/8a0c3aea-7425-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"There is an obvious risk here — that if Clinton underplayed her gender hand in 2008, she might overplay it this round.

"“She’s got to earn their trust a little more before they let that be something that matters to them,” this strategist said. “She’s not a cause for women — yet . . .

"The fact that it took Clinton so long to realize that a full apology -- without the caveats of ""that this has been confusing to people,"" etc. -- was an absolutely necessary first step toward putting the story behind her suggests one of two things is going on: 1) Clinton is getting bad advice from her campaign team, or 2) Clinton is resistant to good advice from her campaign team.","2905","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/08/hillary-clinton-finally-apologizes-for-her-private-e-mail-server-but-is-to-too-late/"
"I strongly suspect it's Option No. 2 at work here. Politicians HATE to apologize for anything or admit that they might not have fully grasped the gravity of a situation in the moment. (Heck, all people -- myself included -- hate to apologize.) And it was clear from the very start of this story that Clinton had nothing but contempt for it. She insisted that there was no need for a third party to examine the server. She insisted it was standard operating procedure to use a private e-mail address even though she was the first secretary of state to exclusively do so. She called it a partisan attempt to take her down.","2906","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/08/hillary-clinton-finally-apologizes-for-her-private-e-mail-server-but-is-to-too-late/"

"The question now is whether Clinton's apology can staunch the bleeding created by the e-mail issue.

"The reality is that the planned monthly release of e-mails Clinton sent as secretary of state -- as well as ongoing leaks regarding classified information that passed through her e-mail server -- will continue to present major political problems that simply apologizing can't solve.

Thirty-three percent of Democrats said the email issue bothers them, and 60 percent say they believe it will hurt her in the general election.” In July, her support was 59 percent. Meanwhile, Sen.

And while Russian officials and diplomats rallied behind President Vladi­mir Putin, the Kremlin’s stance appeared further clouded by acknowledgments that the missions have already extended beyond solely the Islamic State.” I am sure Secretary of State John Kerry will be shocked, just shocked, to hear Russia is lying again when it calls reports it is targeting CIA-backed rebels “rubbish.” (Both Syria’s ambassador to Russia and the independent Observatory for Human Rights say the strikes have targeted non-jihadi rebels.) Understand how entirely unreliable we must appear to disheartened allies as we fail to come to the aid of “our side” while Iran and Russia back Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad to the hilt.

"Indeed. In fact, as recounted in “Double Down,” the book about the 2012 campaign by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, the Obama campaign’s research found that the “we’re gonna get rid of that” quote stuck to Romney like a dated tattoo, and female voters didn’t like it:","2961","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/21/morning-plum-hillary-clinton-just-embraced-planned-parenthood-heres-why/"

There is of course now footage of multiple Republican presidential candidates at last week’s debate agreeing with the push to defund the group, with some even saying Congressional Republicans must not surrender even if it means a government shutdown.

"A key difference this time, of course, is that the Democratic presidential nominee is likely to be a woman. And this time, Clinton is fully embracing the idea that electing a female president would be groundbreaking. As explained by Dem pollster Celinda Lake, the underlying calculation behind showcasing her gender is that a woman represents a credible voice on how to make the economy work for American families. In this context, Democrats will strive to portray women’s health care as an economic issue, just as Obama did last time around. A female candidate embracing the health services the group provides for women even as her (virtually all) male Republican rivals vow to defund the group is probably a general-election contrast that the Clinton camp relishes.","2963","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/21/morning-plum-hillary-clinton-just-embraced-planned-parenthood-heres-why/"

"When Hillary Rodham Clinton takes the debate stage Tuesday night in Las Vegas, it will be the first time in more than seven years she's done so. But, Clinton is no debate novice — having participated in more than two dozen debates during the 2008 Democratic primary campaign.","October 13","2980","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/5-things-i-know-about-hillary-clinton-as-a-debater/"
"So, what exactly do we know about Clinton the debater? I watched a bunch of the 2008 debates and read through everything (or most things) I wrote at the time to try and answer just that question. After a while, all of the debates (and the debate performances) start to blend together, but here are five observations I came up with. (You should also read Jack Shafer's Politico piece on what he learned by watching all of Clinton's 2008 debate performances.)","2981","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/5-things-i-know-about-hillary-clinton-as-a-debater/"
"1. She's relentlessly on message. While Clinton's tendency to repeat rote answers and stick to talking points no matter what question is asked can be tedious and even off-putting on the campaign trail, it tends to work quite well in a debate setting. Clinton knows what she wants to say and will bend almost any question — no matter how contentious — back to her talking points. As I wrote of her when I named her a winner in the first Democratic debate of the 2008 primary race: ""She was informed, concise and under control at all times. She showed her tough side when asked what she would do in the event of simultaneous terrorist attacks against two American cities — a question Sen. Barack Obama initially muffed before going back to it later — and managed to avoid any real confrontation over her refusal to apologize for her vote in favor of the use of force resolution.""","2982","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/5-things-i-know-about-hillary-clinton-as-a-debater/"
"2. She likes to stay above the fray. There were 17 Democratic debates in 2007 — and Clinton was the main target for her rivals' barbs in every one of them. For the most part, she tried to parry attacks directed at her and then quickly pivoted to focus on how she was the best candidate to beat the Republican nominee. This wasn't always the case (see more on Clinton as counter-puncher below), but by and large, she was willing to weather a fair amount of incoming without pushing back all that hard. Of course, that dynamic changed when the race — and the debates — narrowed to just Clinton and Obama. But given Clinton's current front-running position in the 2016 contest, I wouldn't expect her to slug it out with any of the other four candidates on stage — including her nearest rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders.","2983","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/5-things-i-know-about-hillary-clinton-as-a-debater/"
"3. She can deliver a line. All candidates come into a debate with a few zingers in their back (or front) pocket. It's the result of hours of debate prep and the certain knowledge that the best way to get noticed or to ""win"" a debate is with a witty retort. (Joe Biden's ""yes"" when asked if he would have the discipline to represent the U.S. on the world stage is a classic of the genre.) Questioned in one debate about allegations that she was playing the gender card — sidebar: all references to ""playing the [fill in the blank] card"" should immediately be banished — Clinton said, ""People are not attacking me because I am a woman, they are attacking me because I am ahead."" A good line — and well delivered.","2984","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/5-things-i-know-about-hillary-clinton-as-a-debater/"
"4. She's better at counter-punching than she is at hitting first. Clinton has a strong, natural sense of when to leave attacks be and when to return fire. When she does decide to fire back, she's usually quite effective, thanks to her ability to quickly call up the key opposition research points against whoever is attacking her — Clinton has that knack in common with Donald Trump! — and tick them off. What she's far less adept at is taking the fight to an opponent. That's probably because for the vast majority of Clinton's time as a debater — both in the 2000 New York Senate race and in the 2008 presidential race — she's been the clear front-runner. An underdog's tactics don't come naturally to her. She never seemed to fully commit to a debate hit during 2008; she sort-of backed into attacks on, for instance, Obama's controversial pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright. ""You get to choose your pastor,"" Clinton said in a debate in Philadelphia in April 2008. ""You don't choose your family, but you get to choose your pastor. And when asked a direct question, I said I would not have stayed in the church."" It's not a bad line. But it wasn't nearly as forceful as it could have been.","2985","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/5-things-i-know-about-hillary-clinton-as-a-debater/"
"5. Her cautiousness can get the best of her. The most memorable moment of the 2008 Democratic primary debates was a bad one for Clinton. In a late-October 2007 debate in Philadelphia, Clinton seemed to have things on cruise control, carefully avoiding any traps that her opponents tried to set for her. Then, in the final minutes of the debate, Clinton offered an overly political and equivocating answer on whether she supported giving undocumented workers driver's licenses in New York. Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) quickly attacked — and was joined by Obama and then-Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.). For Clinton, it marked the end of her time as the undisputed front-runner in the race — even though no one knew it at the time. The problem for Clinton is that cautiousness works only so well; it occasionally veers into looking as though she is forever calculating her responses. That debate trait could be problematic for Clinton tonight — especially when it comes to answering questions (whether from the moderators or the other candidates) about her private e-mail server.","2986","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/5-things-i-know-about-hillary-clinton-as-a-debater/"

"Clinton also said peace is difficult so long as the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militia's next move is unclear. Iran is the militia's principal benefactor.

"A new Washington Post/ABC News poll released this morning found that Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable rating has jumped to 53 percent — her highest in Post/ABC polling since 2008. Other polls have shown similar findings of late, and the usual suspects have been very quick to declare that this must show she’s sinking under the weight of the ongoing email story, which the public must care about very deeply.","September 2","3049","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"
"But while there’s little question that the email story does matter, it may be only a part of a larger, more compelling explanation: Clinton does better in the polls when she is not seen as a partisan political figure, and she sinks in the polls when she is seen as a partisan political figure.","3050","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"

"As it turns out, this pattern has been visible in polling of Clinton that goes back over two decades. Scott Clement, one of the Post’s crack polling gurus, whipped up this chart of Clinton’s favorable ratings in national Post polling going all the way back to before 1992, when Hillary’s husband first won the presidency:","3052","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"

"Run your cursor over the chart to get the details. As you can see, the pattern is pretty clear. After Bill Clinton won the presidency, Hillary Clinton’s national favorability rating jumped to 59 percent. It dropped during the 1994 midterm elections, and dropped precipitously, into the 20s and 30s, during the 1996 reelection campaign. It then climbed again, and reached a high point in the late 1990s, during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, when she became a sympathetic First Lady figure suffering the slings and arrows of politics.","3054","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"
"Then, in 1999, when it became clear that Clinton was going to run for Senate from New York, her numbers sank down into the 50s and even into the 40s, where they remained throughout her victorious campaign. Her numbers then slowly climbed over the years, getting into the high 50s, then promptly sank just after she launched her last presidential campaign in early 2007. They jumped again, then dropped further towards the end of the losing 2008 presidential effort. They then rose again over the years as she carried out the job of Secretary of State, peaking in January of 2013 — before plummeting steadily as it became increasingly clear she was running for president again, to where they are now that she’s a declared candidate.","3055","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"
"Now, obviously, it’s hard to know how important the cycling in and out of political roles has been in determining her numbers. There may have been other, different, transitory factors that influenced them over the years. But it’s worth noting that the political science bears out the idea that her changing roles might be a key factor.","3056","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"
"“The political science would say that people assess Clinton based on the information they’re given,” John Sides, a George Washington University political science professor who founded the Post’s Monkey Cage blog, tells me. “When she moves out of electoral politics, she’s still at some remove from the day-to-day hullabaloo. When Clinton enters into electoral politics, she gets criticized by the opposing party and scrutinized by the media. The information voters get is less consistently positive, and as a consequence, people’s assessments change.”","3057","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"

"What’s more, Clinton may occupy a bit of a unique position as someone — as a woman — who has consistently cycled back and forth from non-political, above-the-fray roles that nonetheless attract enormous national media scrutiny (First Lady, Secretary of State), to equally high-profile political roles (Senate candidate, presidential candidate, and, now, presidential candidate again).","3059","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"

"“In 1999, she began the campaign as First Lady,” Wolfson tells me. “As she became a political figure and a target of attacks, her numbers reflected that. This dynamic is not all that dissimilar from the current one. She was out of politics as Secretary of State, and now that she’s re-entered the political arena, she’s become a more political figure by definition. And her numbers now reflect that.”","3061","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"
"None of this is to say that the email story isn’t taking a toll on her image. Polls show majorities see her handling of her emails as problematic, and the story probably does feed into a longtime vulnerability of hers — questions about her honesty. But the point is that a drop in her numbers was probably inevitable. Even if the email story is in fact exacerbating her current troubles, it is probably just feeding into a dynamic that might have been there anyway.","3062","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/02/what-hillarys-sinking-poll-numbers-really-mean-in-one-chart/"
"If there had been no email story, voters would probably be getting fed other types of negative information, due to attacks from the opposition party and intensified scrutiny from the political media.

"Gay rights activists who opposed the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, challenged this recent explanation by Clinton, saying it was a revisionist version of what really happened. Maddow asked Clinton whether her approach to civil rights issues were different from her husband’s, as shown by the policies he enacted.

"Clinton’s response poses a fact-checking conundrum. She is explaining what she thinks her husband believed — entering the realm of opinions and suppositions, not checkable facts. But she also says “there was certainly evidence to support” the belief that “there was enough political momentum” to ban gay marriage by amending the U.S. Constitution.

"We always place the burden of proof on the speaker. However, the Clinton campaign declined to comment in response to our inquiries.

"Congressional Republicans who proposed DOMA in 1996 framed it as a response to a case making its way through Hawaii’s state court system.

"Some gay rights activists said that if Hawaii recognized same-sex marriage, the ruling should be applied to the 49 other states under the U.S. Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit Clause, which requires states to honor the “public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State.” (For example, when you get a driver’s license from one state, you don’t have to get a new license every time you cross state lines in order to legally drive in that state.)","3073","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/28/hillary-clintons-claim-that-doma-had-to-be-enacted-to-stop-an-anti-gay-marriage-amendment-to-the-u-s-constitution/"

"Sponsors of DOMA said the law would enact two changes: allow each state to reach its own decision about the legality of same-sex unions, and define marriage as between a man and woman under federal law for the purposes of federal programs and benefits.

"Our review of congressional record and news coverage from 1996 found little public evidence that Democratic lawmakers decided to vote for DOMA because of a threat of a constitutional amendment.

"When we asked if there were any public discussions of such concerns in 1996, Frank referred us to floor debates in 2004 and 2005 over the Federal Marriage Amendment. Democratic lawmakers arguing against that amendment cited their support of DOMA, to make the case that the amendment was unnecessary, he said. Congressional records showed that several Democratic lawmakers who supported DOMA did, indeed, use that argument to oppose the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004.","3095","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/28/hillary-clintons-claim-that-doma-had-to-be-enacted-to-stop-an-anti-gay-marriage-amendment-to-the-u-s-constitution/"

"“Thinking back on it, those were private conversations that people did have, and I am more than willing to say again that that was something that came up in private discussions that I had. The important thing is, DOMA is gone. … Look what happened under the George W. Bush administration, when it was Karl Rove’s strategy to put constitutional amendments on state ballots. … This was a real problem that people were concerned about. And if I’m wrong about the public debate, I obviously take responsibility for that. But I think the important thing is that we are now beyond that, and my husband has certainly said, and I agree with what he said … [that] thankfully, we have moved to a stage where marriage equality is the law of the land.”]","3097","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/28/hillary-clintons-claim-that-doma-had-to-be-enacted-to-stop-an-anti-gay-marriage-amendment-to-the-u-s-constitution/"
"This is a difficult claim to fact-check, because Clinton essentially explained what she believed her husband was thinking when he supported DOMA. Clearly, The Fact Checker has no insight into what was in his mind in 1996, nor are we privy to the private conversations he may have had then. We are limited to publicly available information and the recollections of those who were involved in the 1996 DOMA debate. And even then, we did not find clear evidence to support her explanation.","3098","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/28/hillary-clintons-claim-that-doma-had-to-be-enacted-to-stop-an-anti-gay-marriage-amendment-to-the-u-s-constitution/"
"If lawmakers’ concern over a potential constitutional amendment guided their votes to support DOMA, they did not voice this publicly back then. More and more states were threatening to pass laws to amend state constitutions as a reaction to the pending Hawaii same-sex marriage case, and it is plausible lawmakers viewed this as indication that a constitutional amendment banning marriage was looming in the absence of a federal statute defining marriage as a heterosexual union. The accounts of those involved in the 1996 DOMA debates are mixed; some say there was no real threat of a constitutional amendment until George W. Bush took office, and others say there was.","3099","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/28/hillary-clintons-claim-that-doma-had-to-be-enacted-to-stop-an-anti-gay-marriage-amendment-to-the-u-s-constitution/"
"We wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios. Clinton’s answer leans toward Three Pinocchios on the facts surrounding the DOMA debate, because at least two lawmakers we spoke to said such a concern of a constitutional amendment did exist at the time, despite the lack of evidence in congressional records and news coverage.","3100","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/28/hillary-clintons-claim-that-doma-had-to-be-enacted-to-stop-an-anti-gay-marriage-amendment-to-the-u-s-constitution/"
"Where Clinton’s statement becomes problematic is when she says “there was certainly evidence to support” that “there was enough political momentum to amend the Constitution of the United States of America, and that there had to be some way to stop that.” This broader characterization of events frames the political momentum toward a constitutional amendment as so prevalent that DOMA had to be enacted as a defensive measure to stop the bubbling movement. That’s absolutely wrong — and thus tipped us to Four Pinocchios.","3101","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/28/hillary-clintons-claim-that-doma-had-to-be-enacted-to-stop-an-anti-gay-marriage-amendment-to-the-u-s-constitution/"

"Clinton pulled in more than $28 million and spent an estimated $24.8 million, for a burn rate of about 88.7 percent, based on early numbers released by her campaign.

"That gives her a small financial cushion over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who raised $26 million and had $26.5 million left in the bank heading into October.

"“What it tells us is that Bernie has financial staying power,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager. “We have the financial wherewithal that will allow for a major campaign through Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada and beyond in state-by-state, delegate-by-delegate contests for the Democratic Party nomination.”","3115","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/01/hillary-clinton-spent-roughly-90-percent-of-the-money-she-raised-over-the-summer/"
"The senator from Vermont has recruited volunteers to do much of his on-the-ground organizing instead of paid staff. He holds events in a range of large-capacity spaces, from middle school gyms to basketball arenas, usually decorated only with an American flag or large campaign sign. He has also incurred minimal fundraising costs by relying on an army of small donors who given him money online.

"Keeping things intentionally small avoids a direct comparison with Sanders’s impressive ground organizing operation, much of it done on a shoestring.

"Her road events in New Hampshire and Iowa are not obviously lavish. Accoutrements rarely go beyond folding chairs, taped-up campaign signs and cases of water. But behind-the-scenes, there are large numbers of staffers and a hefty cost of private plane travel for Clinton and her small circle of aides. Clinton is using a rented jet almost exclusively these days, and flying several days a week for both public events and private fund-raising parties.","3122","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/01/hillary-clinton-spent-roughly-90-percent-of-the-money-she-raised-over-the-summer/"

"Clinton’s rapid spending rate and Sanders’s ability to nearly match her fundraising haul last quarter raised new questions about the financial advantage she was expected to have in the primary contest. Her third-quarter total surprised some top campaign bundlers, who had been assured by senior Clinton aides that the campaign was meeting its goals.

"The day after Tuesday’s debate, speculation among Democrats about Biden’s future was inextricably connected to Clinton’s dominant evening against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and three other rivals.

"The path for Biden has always looked daunting, despite the desire among some Democrats for him to enter the race. He has trailed Clinton in all the polls, nationally and in Iowa and New Hampshire.

"After the debate, Clinton aides were not saying explicitly whether Biden has a path, but after weeks of neutral comments, the language turned.

"Biden has spoken publicly about this question several times in recent weeks. At no time was he able to give a definitive answer to the question of whether he and his family could give a full commitment to the demands of a campaign.

"That process inevitably clashed with the practical realities of what a campaign requires — the recruitment of talent, the creation of an organization, the prodigious fundraising, the constant travel, the development of a rationale and message — and it has been obvious for weeks to those watching the vice president’s process of decision-making that there would likely be no real clarity by the time he had to decide.","3155","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clintons-debate-performance-complicates-bidens-path/2015/10/14/28e0fe94-729b-11e5-ba14-318f8e87a2fc_story.html"
"The longer Biden has deliberated, the more the issue of Clinton’s vulnerability has come to the forefront. As questions about her use of a private e-mail server swirled, as her personal image deteriorated, as her perceived weaknesses grew, nervous Democrats looked to Biden as a possible backstop. Calls into his orbit gathered force, urging him to run.","3156","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clintons-debate-performance-complicates-bidens-path/2015/10/14/28e0fe94-729b-11e5-ba14-318f8e87a2fc_story.html"

"Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers suggest she has not hit rock bottom. The latest Quinnipiac poll tells us her support among Democrats (43 percent) equals the combined support for her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (25 percent) and her potential rival Vice President Joe Biden (18 percent). Unless Biden draws all his support from Sanders, which is highly unlikely, his entry into the race very likely will mean the plurality of Democrats want someone other than Clinton.

"It is easy to see why. Clinton remains mired in the e-mail scandal, something even loyal Democrats now believe is sapping her strength. (Sen.

"In the Quinnipiac poll, her honesty/trustworthy score (32 percent say she is, 63 percent say she is not) is worse than Donald Trump’s (35 percent to 57 percent) among voters surveyed. Clinton is also in negative territory in terms of overall favorability (41 percent favorable, 55 percent unfavorable). In match-ups against Republicans, she does worse than Biden. If Democrats are looking for a “safe bet,” Clinton does not qualify. I don’t think it is coincidental that as the Biden buzz grows, Clinton’s untrustworthy and favorability numbers decline. If Democrats feel they have a viable alternative, they will likely feel less inclined to rationalize her conduct and stick with her.","3170","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/24/will-hillary-clinton-implode/"
"If — as most observers now suspect — Biden does jump in, it is entirely possible her support crumbles. If she loses one or both races in Iowa and New Hampshire, her defeat might be inevitable.

Rather than devising smart solutions that target scarce federal resources where they’re most needed, he wants to waste massive amounts of money Congress wouldn’t ever give him — and shouldn’t — to provide benefits to a lot of people who don’t need them. The government already spends astounding amounts subsidizing the housing, education, health care and retirement of the upper and upper-middle classes through tax breaks for mortgage interest, cut-rate student loans, in-state tuition, the tax exemption for employer-provided health-care, universal Medicare and universal Social Security. That’s billions upon billions every year that could go into anti-poverty programs, research or roads without raising taxes. Rather than scaling back this nonprogressive nonsense, Sanders proposes to double down on it — just as the impending retirement of the boomers is straining the social programs we already have and just as the country’s infrastructure requires upgrading.","3181","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/10/06/why-hillary-clinton-is-more-progressive-than-bernie-sanders-in-one-sentence/"

"This is Clinton’s renowned if scantly shared sense of humor. And truth be known, few are better with a withering quip than she. My favorite was during a 2008 appearance with then-senator Barack Obama. Clinton was clearly fed up with the media fawning over her opponent.

"Clinton’s humor, which can range from the self-effacing (“The hair is real, the color isn’t”) to the pinioned dart (see Obama), reveals not so much meanness as contempt.

"Thus, as this fall season of let’s-torture-the-candidates unfolds, we’ll be hearing more laughs, more joking around when appropriate (the Clinton campaign has recognized that joking about the e-mail server isn’t funny anymore), and, yes, more spontaneity — because spontaneity really works best when it’s planned.","3236","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-ode-to-joy/2015/09/08/f4a77838-5657-11e5-abe9-27d53f250b11_story.html"

"I concur with those who insist that Clinton can’t do anything right no matter what. Her critics are worse than the Literals.

"Clinton is snubbing the most powerful LGBT group in the country for a chance at five minutes (or so) of airtime at 11:30 p.m. on a Saturday because she and her campaign know that they have to poke a hole in the current perception of her as guarded, stiff and not terribly honest.

It's her inability to effectively deal with the existence of the private e-mail server she used exclusively while serving as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton's botched handling of the issue has reminded people of all the things they associate with the Clintons and don't like — a sense that the rules don't apply to them, a paranoia that everyone is out to get them and a tendency to surround themselves with people who aren't willing to or can't tell them that certain things are just bad ideas.","3251","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/01/hillary-clinton-is-going-on-saturday-night-live-to-fix-her-image-problem/"

"Hillary name-dropped Obama more than anyone else, by far. Responding to questions about her early support for the Iraq war, she noted that Obama opposed it but still chose her for secretary of state. Clinton used the word “we” repeatedly to describe various actions overseas, including a dramatic retelling of herself and Obama chasing after the Chinese to try getting a climate change deal.

Planned Parenthood said the videos were deceptively edited and denied seeking any payments beyond legally permitted reimbursement of costs. … Planned Parenthood says its fetal tissue programs currently take place in only two states — California and Washington — at about a half-dozen of the 700 health centers run by the organization nationwide.”","3289","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/14/the-daily-202-hillary-clinton-won-the-debate-and-six-other-takeaways-from-las-vegas/"

Help needed’ … The application ‘SketchFactor,’ which invited users to report ‘sketchy’ people, faced allegations of racism in both the District and New York. Another social network roiled Oakland, Calif., when white residents used Nextdoor.com to cite ‘suspicious activity’ about black neighbors. Taking it even further was GhettoTracker.com, which asked users to rate neighborhoods based on whether they thought they were ‘safe’ or a ‘ghetto.’ Now ‘Operation GroupMe’ is stirring controversy in Georgetown.” A review showed that 70 percent of 6,000 “GroupMe” messages since last March focused on African-Americans.","3296","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/14/the-daily-202-hillary-clinton-won-the-debate-and-six-other-takeaways-from-las-vegas/"

"We learned many things during Saturday’s Democratic primary debate. We learned that Hillary Rodham Clinton is backed by Wall Street bankers because of the support she showed them after 9/11. (Sure.) We learned from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that climate change is “directly related to the growth of terrorism.""

"But he continues to be tough on his party’s front-runner in his new role in the media. This is one reason why Axelrod is a solid analyst. He seems to take seriously the job of breaking down the candidates and isn’t just there to shill for Democrats.","3355","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/17/why-obamas-former-top-political-adviser-is-a-problem-for-hillary-clinton/"

"There’s a worked-with-her-and-didn’t-like-everything-about-her quality to Axelrod’s critiques that could hurt a candidate who polls well on foreign policy and not so well on favorability (a net rating of negative-5 in a recent Washington Post/ABC News survey). When the New York Times wrote in September that Clinton would try to show more of the humor and personality that aides claim to see behind the scenes, for instance, Axelrod mocked the effort.","3357","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/17/why-obamas-former-top-political-adviser-is-a-problem-for-hillary-clinton/"

"CEDAR FALLS, Iowa — These days, Hillary Rodham Clinton and her senior campaign staff sound like old-school investment advisers when the market has a stomach-lurching drop: Remain calm, they say. Don’t panic.

"Faced with her worst poll ratings since she was losing badly to Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton is doubling down on a strategy laid out months ago. As drawn up by campaign manager Robby Mook and others when Clinton was seemingly invincible, the prospectus is a detailed month-by-month, state-by-state strategy to roll out serious policy proposals, raise a prohibitive amount of money, lock up Democratic delegates and woo members of her party’s disaffected left.","3362","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"It was designed to win what had been presumed to be a somewhat dull primary without looking too presumptuous. Now Clinton has a full-on fight on her hands against a surging Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and faces the possibility that Vice President Biden will make a late entrance. Biden sits at roughly 20 percent in recent polls, and most of that support appears to come from erstwhile Clinton voters.","3363","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"“You are supposed to have an election. You are supposed to have a contest,” Clinton said here this week during a question-and-answer session with students and others at the University of Northern Iowa. “In the Democratic primaries and caucuses, you have to try to earn every single person’s support. That is what I intend to do.”","3364","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"Clinton’s tumble in national surveys, including in a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, owes partly to fallout from the fracas surrounding her State Department e-mails and partly to an anti-establishment sentiment fueling Sanders’s rise. More than 7 in 10 Americans say people in politics cannot be trusted. More than 6 in 10 say the political system does not work.","3365","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"Clinton still leads among Democrats nationally, but for the first time her support has dropped below 50 percent in Post-ABC surveys.

"Top campaign aides have told nervous supporters in recent days that none of the bad news is an argument to veer from the plan or lose heart. Mook does some of the hand-holding himself, telling donors that as the 2016 race jells this fall and winter, the “fundamentals” he has set in place will be a bedrock no other candidate on either side of the race can match.","3368","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"

"“There is always going to be second-guessing of any strategy,” and the test is whether the strategy falls apart under that scrutiny, Fallon said, that “when adversity arises, that you not deviate from the plan, that you stick it out, remain confident and ride out whatever turbulence you may encounter.”","3371","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"The original plan assumed that Clinton would dispatch a challenge from her left before moving on to the general-election contest, where her center-left views, long résumé and hawkish national security credentials would have broad appeal.","3372","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"Although Mook and others warned against overconfidence, most Clinton backers did not seriously contemplate that Clinton could lose to the dark horse Sanders in New Hampshire or Iowa, as current polling suggests she could, or that her perceived weakness would be an invitation to Biden.","3373","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"Clinton has an eye on the general election and Republican front-runner Donald Trump even as the current concern is more about the comparisons with Sanders. Her campaign released a new Web video Wednesday, styled after Trump’s former “Celebrity Apprentice” show, that ridiculed Republican candidates ahead of their second debate.","3374","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"In Cedar Falls, Clinton declined a student’s invitation to discuss Sanders’s political views, which are far to Clinton’s left, and said she is looking forward to the first Democratic debate next month. She is holding intraparty fire until then, despite some pressure from antsy supporters.","3375","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"

"The idea is that when the dust settles — on the Democratic side and in the raucous Republican primary — Clinton will stand as the best-qualified and most electable candidate. The person, in the words of one Clinton adviser, who looks like the grown-up.","3377","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"She is focusing on women this month, including her event this week in Iowa announcing a program to reduce campus sexual assault. She spoke before a crowd of about 500. It was a fairly large venue by the standards of Clinton events that cannot compete with Sanders’s crowds of thousands — and that sometimes seem designed to avoid the comparison.","3378","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"The plan also factored in an onslaught of GOP attacks on Clinton’s record as secretary of state, her family ties and her family foundation. It did not initially account for the news that Clinton had used a privately owned and operated e-mail system for her State Department work, since only a handful of close advisers knew of the arrangement and Clinton apparently did not consider it a liability.","3379","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"

"“We recognize that this will be a subject we need to address, and we will do so,” he added. “We feel that while the topic won’t completely go away, it won’t obstruct or block out our other messages about the other issues that matter as time goes by.”","3382","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"

"The bet is that the e-mail issue will not irreparably damage Clinton’s appeal as a hard worker and advocate for the little guy, the basis of her second campaign. But even some of her strongest backers say they are not sure she can ever put the question of whether she skirted government rules behind her.","3384","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
"It is not yet clear whether Clinton’s troubles have dampened the pace of her fundraising, which hit a record $46 million in her first three months. The next Federal Election Commission report is due Sept. 30; Fallon said the campaign is comfortable with the fundraising numbers but declined to provide details.","3385","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"

"The e-mail issue and falling poll numbers are nothing Clinton cannot manage, several donors and supporters said. But two major donors — who requested anonymity to speak candidly — said they have told the campaign they felt blindsided by the e-mail issue and are uneasy about where an FBI investigation into the security of Clinton’s system could lead.","3387","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"

"“The Clintons have faced far worse crises. This is a blip,” said John Morgan, a major Florida fundraiser and host of one of Clinton’s early fundraising parties in the spring. “The problem was not dealing with it quickly. If someone walks in and says, ‘Stand up so I can see what’s under the cushion,’ you stand up and let them look. She should have stood up immediately because there is nothing under the cushion and never was.”","3389","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html"
