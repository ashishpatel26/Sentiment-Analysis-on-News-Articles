"The House on Wednesday night narrowly passed its version of a budget blueprint after Republican leaders agreed to tack on extra defense spending over the protest of conservative members who opposed busting the caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act.

"Democrats nevertheless continue to trumpet individual parts of the overhaul, citing benefits like the elimination of preexisting conditions as grounds for denial of coverage and the expansion of Medicaid to cover more Americans.

"“The Obama administration is shortchanging victims by using these settlements to send money to their pet projects rather than allowing it to go to directly to the people who were harmed in the first place,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., told FoxNews.com on Monday.“Furthermore, the administration is also abusing the separation of powers by using these cases to funnel money to their preferred special interests in an attempt to do an end run around Congress, which the Constitution grants the power of the purse.”","50","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/09/house-republicans-question-justice-mortgage-settlement-with-wall-st-that-steers.html"

"Goodlatte and Hensarling also have raised concerns about the incentive structure in the settlements with Citigroup and Bank of America, which were preceded by a similar one in 2013 with JP Morgan for $13 billion.

"“This makes donations to activist groups far more attractive to banks than providing relief to injured consumers,” Goodlatte and Hensarling said in their 2014 letter to Holder. “As a result, the settlement appears to serve as a vehicle for funding activist groups rather than as a means of securing relief for consumers actually harmed.”","64","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/09/house-republicans-question-justice-mortgage-settlement-with-wall-st-that-steers.html"

"The 1971 San Diego Padres were a wretched lot. The team lost 100 games. Finished in last place, 28-and-a-half games out of first. They were the least-patronized team in the National League. The front office tired of the Padres’ losing ways and applied pressure on manager Preston Gomez. One day there was a close call at third base which clearly went against San Diego. But Gomez skipped out of the dugout anyway to argue with umpire Harry Wendelstedt. Upon arriving at third base, Gomez told Wendelstedt he knew the call was right but he was on orders from the Padres’ brass to “put on a show.” The Padres may not look like much on the field. But maybe the manager could show some spark and get into a good rhubarb with the umpires.","Published February 14, 2015","225","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/14/republicans-must-stage-show-on-immigration.html"

"Congress fully funded all federal departments except DHS in December. DHS was the lone stray because conservatives insisted to leaders they use that spending bill to block the executive orders.

"Senate Republicans have already engineered three procedural votes over the past few weeks to cut off the filibuster. Such an operation requires 60 yeas. Republicans only hold 54 Senate seats.

"With the deadline looming, some Republicans are batting around the idea of lopping off the immigration provisions and simply advancing the “clean” DHS spending bill with no attachments.

"It’s generally thought that most of the House’s 188 Democrats would vote yes on either bill. But with 433 members, 217 are needed to pass if all lawmakers vote. According to sources, it is possible that the Republican majority might not be able to cough up 29 of its own just to avoid defunding the Department of Homeland Security. Moreover, the House could stumble clearing a procedural hurdle of its own just to bring a “clean” or stopgap bill to the floor. Most bills in the House first require a “rule” to establish the parameters of debate. But if a “rule” fails, the House can’t consider the underlying bill. The House narrowly approved the rule to bring up the last big spending bill called the “CRomnibus” in December. And that only came after some arm-twisting. In recent days, the House GOP leadership started cracking down on its deputy whips, committee chairs and subcommittee chairs over deviating on key procedural votes. The argument was that if those lawmakers wanted to remain in those positions, they must vote with leaders.","249","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/14/republicans-must-stage-show-on-immigration.html"

"House Republicans on Wednesday dropped a bill that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks, abandoning legislation that at one time seemed certain to pass the chamber but fell victim to intra-party disputes over concerns that the law would alienate women voters.","Published January 22, 2015","352","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/22/house-gop-struggles-to-get-votes-on-abortion-bill-for-roe-v-wade-anniversary.html"

"Instead, the House will vote Thursday -- the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v.

"The substitute bill would make permanent the so-called Hyde amendment, which bans all federal money for abortion services. Currently, Congress simply renews the amendment each year, which it has done since the mid-1970s. Voting on the bill Thursday would provide Republicans with a symbolic act on the same day that the anti-abortion March for Life is scheduled to begin in Washington.","355","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/22/house-gop-struggles-to-get-votes-on-abortion-bill-for-roe-v-wade-anniversary.html"

"There was concern that the bill would have looked bad for the Republican Party as it struggles to court female voters in the 2016 presidential and congressional elections, and primary and general election candidates could have turned the vote around on the Republicans.

I’ve seen first-hand the traits that made him a world-class businesses man, savior of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, and a strong chief executive as governor of the Bay State.

"GOP Gov. Pete Ricketts has vowed to veto the bill.

"Several hurdles still lie in the path of those supporting repeal.

"Buzz Cut: • Obama builds hamster wheel for GOP on ISIS • Union friction poses dangers for Dems ahead of 2016 • City of Independence set for Hillary coronation • Gotcha: Dems pounce on Walker dodge on evolution • ‘Happy birthday Princess’","540","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/12/obama-builds-hamster-wheel-for-gop-on-isis.html"
"OBAMA BUILDS HAMSTER WHEEL FOR GOP ON ISIS The White House has made it clear that President Obama doesn’t think he needs an authorization from Congress to continue his limited air war against Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria. Rather, the president would prefer to get congressional approval to send a message to allies and the enemy. As his brief remarks in support of his request reinforced, the requested authorization is seen by the administration as a procedural nicety, not a necessity. Democrats are already dropping, and more will follow. There is little chance that the president or congressional leaders will do much to force their own members into painful votes. The task of passing the president’s request will fall to – and bedevil – the Republican leaders who support military action against ISIS. The measure is already angering Republicans who see little reassurance about what they believe is a halfhearted war effort. And Obama has all but made clear that the status quo will persist at least as long as he is in office.","541","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/12/obama-builds-hamster-wheel-for-gop-on-isis.html"

"Painful position - The president has got Republicans over a barrel, much in the same way that President George W. Bush had the advantage over Democrats in obtaining the current congressional authorization back in 2002. Republicans may not like what’s in Obama’s plan, but face enormous political consequences for not supporting the commander in chief at a time of war. And since Obama argues he doesn’t need the approval, there’s little leverage available to Republicans. The Constitution empowers the legislative branch to stop a president from fighting by denying funds for a war, but makes no provision for forcing a president to fight. After weeks of agonizing back and forth negotiating with themselves, Republicans will eventually have to accept something close to the initial gauzy request. At that point, Obama will happily drop it in his desk drawer and proceed as if it had never happened.","543","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/12/obama-builds-hamster-wheel-for-gop-on-isis.html"
"“The disaster that is Libya is now a breeding ground for terrorists and also a breeding ground for armament.

"Squeaky wheel - Aside from distracting and dividing Republicans, the authorization move has another political advantage for the president: It inculpates the GOP in his unpopular war strategy. Without an authorization vote, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates are free to deplore Obama’s war strategy. And that’s been good politics. In the latest Fox News poll, 73 percent of voters say President Obama does not have a clear plan to defeat ISIS, an increase of 9 percent from September when the air strikes began. 60 percent of voters believe that US ground troops will be necessary to defeat ISIS, a gain of 9 percent since September. But after they eventually sanction the war, Republicans will have far less to say about its conduct. Obama has built the perfect hamster wheel to keep Republicans spinning on foreign policy for months to come.","545","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/12/obama-builds-hamster-wheel-for-gop-on-isis.html"

After the final practice session the night before the big debate, Obama snapped at Axelrod after his adviser told him, ‘there’s some stuff we need to clean up.’ ‘[Motherf-----’s] never happy,’ the president said, storming off.”","546","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/12/obama-builds-hamster-wheel-for-gop-on-isis.html"

"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... It was a cold February afternoon in 1924 that a young Broadway composer, George Gershwin debuted his concerto, ‘Rhapsody in Blue.’ Just after the New Year, Gershwin, his brother Ira and lyricist Buddy DeSylva were playing billiards when a notice in the New York Tribune caught their attention. A concert of new American music was going to be performed by Paul Whiteman and his Palais Royal Band on February 12. The article also said, “George Gershwin is at work on a jazz concerto.” This was news to George as his musical, ‘Sweet Little Devil,’ was opening in three weeks. Whiteman convinced Gershwin that all he had to do was create the piano score and Whiteman’s arranger, Ferde Grofé, would be able to orchestrate the rest. While traveling between Boston and New York for musical rehearsals, Gershwin sketched out the score. The completed work made it on time for the concert with its composer as soloist in front of a packed house including musical luminaries composer Rachmaninov, violinist Fritz Kreisler and conductor Leopold Stokowski .","549","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/12/obama-builds-hamster-wheel-for-gop-on-isis.html"

He says a series of struggles on the state level reveal the scope of the conflict: “This trend has become starkly visible in Wisconsin. Governor Scott Walker’s 2011 bill, Act 10, reduced collective bargaining rights for many public-sector workers, making him AFSCME’s Number One target in the 2014 elections. Among other efforts to boost the economy, however, Walker signed legislation that streamlined mining regulations, hoping to encourage outside investment. Every Democrat in the Wisconsin legislature opposed the bill on environmental grounds, but blue-collar unions like the Wisconsin Pipe Trades and the Milwaukee Building and Trades Council recognized its potential to create jobs for their members, and got behind it. … Walker wound up winning an impressive victory against Democratic challenger Mary Burke; even more telling, exit polls found that, three years after Act 10, 52 percent of Wisconsin voters had an unfavorable view of government unions.”","552","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/12/obama-builds-hamster-wheel-for-gop-on-isis.html"

All of us at CBS News and particularly at 60 Minutes will miss him very much…’ Over a 47-year career at CBS News, Simon earned more than 40 major awards, including 27 Emmys, believed to be the most ever earned for a field reporter and four Peabody Awards.” ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRINCESS’ Would the greatest love letter of all time really begin: “We get old and get used to each other?” It depends on what comes next and who wrote it. A survey of 1,000 people by British insurance company Beagle Street asked participants to rank a selection of love letters. The options included swelling prose and passionate paeans from the likes of John Keats, Napoleon Bonaparte, Earnest Hemmingway and Ludwig van Beethoven. But what touched readers most was a rough-hewn note written by Johnny Cash from a tour stop in Denmark to his wife June in 1994 for her 65th birthday. The couple had been married for 26 years by then, but he wanted his woman to know he still meant business: “Maybe [we] sometimes take each other for granted. But once in awhile, like today, I meditate on it and realize how lucky I am to share my life with the greatest woman I ever met. You still fascinate and inspire me. You influence me for the better. You’re the object of my desire, the #1 Earthly reason for my existence. I love you very much.” Just like Cash’s music, the raw honesty and straightforward message was a winner. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “[President Obama] proposes here a strategy, although of course there are no details, in which he announces this is going to be for three years. He doesn't have to withdraw in three years but what is the purpose of putting a time limit on it in any way?…What you do is you say we are going to fight the war if you want an end date on it, until ISIS is defeated.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.","564","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/12/obama-builds-hamster-wheel-for-gop-on-isis.html"

"If you arrived on Earth today from outer space and looked at Washington, you’d never guess that the Republican Party holds both houses of Congress. In fact, you’d be certain that the Democrats, not the GOP, won a landslide in the midterm elections last November.","Published March 25, 2015","568","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"Remarkably, since taking control of both the House and Senate, Republicans have systematically ceded the initiative to the Democrats. The GOP has shot itself in the foot; starting with their inept strategy to counter President Obama’s executive amnesty on immigration culminating with their hapless capitulation on funding for Homeland Security to committing missteps like the Iran letter which offers Obama and the Democrats a scapegoat should the Iran deal fall through. Now comes the looming disastrous suggestion of House Speaker Boehner’s to have special investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s missing emails –a sign that the Republicans have learned nothing from the 1990s.","569","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"The GOP finds itself in the tenuous position of having to depend on Democrats to accomplish things. This is a hugely ironic outcome for a party that claimed, last November, to have won a stronger mandate to govern than we’ve seen in decades. As a consequence they are facing a potential fracturing of their own voting base – the very voters who delivered to the party a landslide victory just a few short months ago.","570","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"Where have they gone wrong? The answer lies not only in what they have done since January, but what they did—and didn’t do—before, during the election campaign.","571","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"The Republicans never crafted and sustained a narrative message to promote their agenda, which should’ve been founded on a pro-growth economic strategy, piecemeal immigration reform and sensible fixes to Obamacare. Consequently, when it came time to govern, they have had little to fall back on but their time-honored (and failed) strategy of simply opposing President Obama.","572","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"This strategy hasn’t worked with voters, who give Republicans lower marks in recent polls than Democrats. And it hasn’t worked with the party’s base, which is chomping at the bit for some real leadership.","573","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"In the latest PPP national Republican poll, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, still relatively unknown, leads the pack of potential nominees with 25% of the vote. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has electrified the GOP with his strong conservativism and Tea Party appeal, garners 18%. Their combined 43% is an indication of the broad dissatisfaction by the Republican voters with the Republican political class.","574","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"In a recent poll of Republican voters supervised by Caddell Associates, Boehner held a paltry 43% favorability rating, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fared even worse, with 38%. A majority of voters said that Boehner has been ineffective in Congress. And only 25% felt that Boehner and McConnell should be elected to their leadership positions. Indeed, only 16% of Republican voters wanted both Boehner and McConnell elected to top leadership; 53% preferring neither or someone new. The party itself also polls poorly with all voters: the latest Quinnipiac poll finds that 69% disapprove and only 22% approve of how Republicans are handling their job in Congress.","575","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"Republican leadership is even failing with fellow Republicans. Just look at last week’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill debacle, wherein Boehner had to depend on Democratic support to pass funding for the department. Only 75 Republicans voted with him—and those Republicans heard it from their base for having conceded the immigration. Rumblings are afoot about a conservative coup to unseat the speaker. And it is now Democrats who say they will protect Boehner’s speakership against a conservative revolt.","576","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"Boehner was right to ensure that essential DHS funding should continue. The problem, however, is this: Republican voters are deeply concerned about illegal immigration: only 9% approve of Obama’s handling of the issue. While most didn’t support shutting down DHS, they are sick and tired of seeing their leaders capitulate to Obama and the Democrat agenda.","577","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"These voters wanted the GOP to make Obama’s pending order a campaign issue last fall. Indeed, the reason President Obama delayed his executive action until after the election was because their polling had found that the issue had turned toxic. A large majority of voters opposed the specifics of what the president was to do, and even larger majorities opposed the president taking executive action unilaterally. But the Republicans never confronted it, never got on the record saying that the president didn’t have the authority to do what he did, never forced Democrats to take sides.","578","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"Crucially, they have also yet to come up with a comprehensive immigration plan that puts border security first and only then offers a limited pathway to legal residence to those who obey the law and pay taxes. This is a plan that the base will accept and one that many Democrats will arguably support.","579","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"Similarly it appears the Republicans have not been able to put forth a party-wide position on how they would revise, reform or replace ObamaCare, which was with immigration the other major issue of concern to independents who voted for the Republicans in November. In each of these cases not only have they failed to advance a substantive agenda, they have failed to make a sustained political case to the majority of Americans who support them on immigration and ObamaCare – indeed not even on the Keystone Pipeline veto where a vast majority of all Americans supported the pipeline.","580","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"As a result, the Republican leadership has had nothing much more to fall back on than anti-Obamaism. Some key players, like Bush, realized that this futile approach won’t win back the White House. “It’s good to oppose the bad things, but we need to start being for things,” Bush told the CPAC crowd.","581","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"He’s right, but Bush may be the wrong bearer of that message. The Republican establishment leadership has no clue about its voters who are the most alienated and most anti-Washington in the electorate. If they did, they would’ve adopted some of their voters’ core concerns in January, when they took possession of congress.","582","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"In this climate, an insurgent anti-establishment/anti-corruption candidate could clean up in the Republican primaries. And that’s a big part of Scott Walker’s initial appeal. He’s selling a message of what he’s accomplished, and not just ideology and anti-Obamaism.","583","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"But whether it’s Walker next year or another candidate, someone needs to start carrying the Republican banner—in campaigns and in the political battles in Washington. Republican voters thought they’d elected such representation last fall. They’ve been bitterly disappointed. Expect to see consequences, and soon.","584","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"

"Asked last week if any Republicans who voted against Boehner would be punished, spokesman Michael Steel told The Daily Caller by email: “Boehner has said publicly that there will be no retribution for ‘no’ votes.”","589","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/06/boehner-moves-to-punish-dissenters-despite-past-statements.html"
"In September, USA Today reported that Boehner “shot down fresh rumors that he will face a revolt from conservatives when he seeks a third term as speaker in January, and he dismissed suggestions that his leadership team would strip committee assignments from any GOP lawmaker who voted against him.”","590","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/06/boehner-moves-to-punish-dissenters-despite-past-statements.html"

"“After being told that we should now all come together and work together, we have been told late today that two of our Congressmen are being taken off of the committee they were on, simply for voting like their voters wanted,” Gohmert said in a Tuesday statement. “So, it appears before we can work together, we are now going to have another fight. It would be a shame if the Speaker of the House who has so much power is a sore winner.”","593","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/06/boehner-moves-to-punish-dissenters-despite-past-statements.html"

Walter Jones were also booted from the Financial Services Committee.","594","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/06/boehner-moves-to-punish-dissenters-despite-past-statements.html"

"For now, the measure would allow for the advance of the 12 annual spending bills for the 2016 budget year beginning Oct. 1 to the House and Senate floors.

"The White House, however, is opposed to easing Pentagon cuts without providing relief to domestic programs as well. That has many Washington budget-watchers looking to a possible small-caliber budget pact later this year that would provide partial but immediate relief to agency budgets next year but paying for it by curbing spending elsewhere in the budget over the long term.

"Like essentially all of the potential GOP candidates, Walker has used the agreement to strike a sharp contrast with Democrats, with Election Day roughly 18 months away, and make the case that the deal appears to give Iran enough space to remain a nuclear threat to Israel and other allies in the region.","769","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/04/2016-republican-hopefuls-criticize-iran-nuclear-agreement-use-tentative-deal-to.html"
"“The Islamic Republic of Iran -- the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism -- is on the march throughout the Middle East,” Walker said earlier. “President Obama’s deal … risks provoking a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world, one that threatens the survival of our closest regional ally Israel and our key Arab partners.”","770","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/04/2016-republican-hopefuls-criticize-iran-nuclear-agreement-use-tentative-deal-to.html"

"The 15-year deal would compel Iran to cut in half the number of centrifuges it has spinning uranium.

"Boehner, at the start of the 114th Congress, now leads the biggest GOP House majority in nearly 70 years. McConnell, after his party picked up nine seats in the midterms, leads a 54-seat majority in the Senate.

"The election for House speaker aired lingering divisions in the GOP. Three conservative lawmakers -- Reps. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas; Ted Yoho, R-Fla.; and Daniel Webster, R-Fla. -- were put forward as challengers; a total of 25 Republicans voted for candidates other than Boehner or voted present.

"Republican presidential aspirants are talking about school choice early and often. Wisconsin governor Scott Walker says, “I believe that we need to give families as many high quality education choices as possible to succeed.” Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal argues, “To oppose school choice is to oppose equal opportunity.” Not to be outdone, provisional front-runner and noted education reform proponent Jeb Bush declares, “Choice rewards success and weeds out stagnation, inefficiency, and failure.” This is a welcome development. Republicans can’t talk seriously about opportunity without addressing education, and parental choice is a powerful lever for tackling school improvement. But school choice is only a start—because choice is only part of a strategy for fighting runaway bureaucracy, creating more great schools, and building a political coalition that can sustain its success. When it comes to improving schools, choice is necessary but insufficient. Parental choice, in the form of charter schooling, school vouchers, tuition tax credits, and education savings accounts, gives families more control and can make it easier for terrific new schools to emerge and expand. However, just as none of the Republican aspirants would suggest that ObamaCare promotes vibrant competition because Americans can “choose” among insurers, so they should be clear that meaningful choice requires a lot more than sloganeering. When focusing on choice alone, advocates can lose sight of the constraints on the decision-making ability of low-income families and how seemingly picayune details in policy can stymie new school providers, burden innovators and higher-fliers, and make it tough for traditional districts to respond effectively to competition. None of this should be news to a conservative who’s studied the free market. Nobel laureates Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman noted decades ago that all “markets” aren’t the same—that their vibrancy depends on larger structures, rules, and routines. So, how can advocates help school choice succeed? First, they can resist the urge to foist the same regulations that have stifled traditional public schools onto schools of choice. Unfortunately, examples of creeping regulation are plentiful. In the school choice mecca of New Orleans, for example, advocates have pushed for all schools to use a uniform expulsion policy. If a “no excuses” high school wants to hold their students to a higher bar than the code allows, too bad. Excessive regulation can threaten the very things that make charter schools distinct. In New York, the enormously successful Success Academies report spending thousands of staff hours filling out more than 60 expansive, oft-duplicative reports. Charter school applications reach a thousand pages or more, giving birth to a cadre of consultants who help charter operators navigate the school application process. This risks creating an insuperable burden for a group of teachers or parents trying to start a school in their community. School choice advocates can also embrace measures that will broaden the appeal and relevance of school choice. Of the one in five American households that have school-age children at home, more than two-thirds give their child’s school an A or a B. School choice focusing solely on letting frustrated parents escape lousy schools speaks to concerns of perhaps six percent of the nation’s households. The way to strengthen parental choice, for everyone and in the long term, is to ensure that it also speaks to the needs of middle-class families. Officials can do that by expanding the array of promising, practical options that families have to provide their children with a rich, robust, and rigorous education. Parents may quite like their school, but dislike its approach to teaching math. They might want to have their child learn Mandarin or Farsi instead of Spanish for French. “Course Choice” programs allow students to take some portion of their state funding to other providers for customized coursework while staying enrolled in their traditional public school. A robust array of online programs are available that can match students to language teachers, or take courses from some of the nation’s top universities. Income, location, and age no longer have to be limiting factors. School choice is good start. But it’s just a start. Republican aspirants who seize on choice as a pillar of their opportunity agenda should be clear on what it will take for it to deliver on its powerful promise.","Published March 26, 2015","1321","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/26/how-republican-presidential-candidates-can-help-school-choice-succeed.html"

"Just a few days ago, Republicans looked as though they may face one big headache in the new year. The issue centered on a solitary member.

"If this controversy erupted when Congress was in session, it’s possible (possible) it may have run its course by now and been laid to rest.

"Scalise has generally kept his head down since the news broke. He released a statement to reporters saying it “was a mistake I regret” and “wholeheartedly condemn” the views of the group.

"On one hand, it may seem that such a respite would enable him to develop his sea legs in the leadership. But the hiatus also has a downside.

"The GOP-plan went through several iterations before leaders rolled out the bill. Then the House appeared to lack the votes to pass the GOP plan.

"It wasn’t fair to pin the uncertainty associated with that vote on Scalise because technically, he wasn’t supposed to be on the job yet to whip the vote. But once the calendar flipped to August 1 and members were still here, fair or not, Scalise was the de facto whip and took some heat in the press.","1445","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/04/gop-congress-aims-to-focus-on-issues-avoid-slip-ups-in-2015.html"

"After some arm-twisting, Republicans clumsily vaulted the procedural barrier by a single vote. The GOP majority had to rely on lots of Democrats to pass the overall bill.

"That criticism may be fair to Scalise. But the race controversy hits as he has a limited body of work in leadership.

"Before the Thurmond episode, there were also daggers out for the Mississippi Republican. Many were in senior Republican circles on Capitol Hill and in the administration of President George W. Bush. Lott adversaries viewed the leader as too conciliatory toward Democrats. They held particular contempt for Lott after he agreed to cede control of the Senate to Democrats once the late-Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vermont, dropped his GOP affiliation and caucused with the other side.

"In early 2001, the Senate was evenly-divided 50/50. Republicans held a nominal advantage as then-Vice President Cheney could break ties. So Lott and the Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.C., forged a power-sharing arrangement. Republicans would control the Senate so long as they had a majority of seats or Cheney served as tiebreaker. However, Democrats would take the helm if they added seats at some point during the Congress.","1456","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/04/gop-congress-aims-to-focus-on-issues-avoid-slip-ups-in-2015.html"

"Hank Green, a wildly successful vlogger with his brother, who regularly reaches 2.4 million people through their YouTube videos, started off the round-robin interviews by thanking the president for welcoming him to his house.

"His questioning was serious. Green also asked one of the smartest questions Obama has had over the last six years. Green told the president, “I don’t smoke pot…I think it’s bad for my brain…but I’m for legalization….how do we move forward out of this legal gray-ness?” It was a way of forming a question many in the White House press corps have never thought about.","1471","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/23/youtubeasksobama-gop-desperately-needs-glozell-moment.html"

"Mota, too, asked the president a question in a way traditional reporters have failed to ask. “I was just in China and couldn’t access the apps and websites I could back home,” Mota said.

"She also said, “I never really followed politics that much…why should the younger generation be interested in politics?” The president again spun a good tale about the need for young people to get involved so they can go to college. Eight million young women now think Obama wants them to go to college. It was a brilliant move by the president.","1480","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/23/youtubeasksobama-gop-desperately-needs-glozell-moment.html"

"If I were advising the presidential contenders (I’m neutral and enjoying the race), I would tell them to create a new Economic Growth Tax Code that does something no one is talking about - abolish all payroll taxes. The new code should also eliminate every loophole and deduction possible, while lowering rates. Three parts to a new tax code. All three aimed at economic growth.","1509","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/08/how-republicans-can-white-house.html"
"Step one is the complete and total elimination of the payroll tax. The notion of dedicated payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare is quaint and false. The payroll tax was supposed to work that way, but like many things in Washington, it became a phony promise. The trust funds are routinely used to pay for other programs, and for decades general revenue dollars have paid Medicare’s bills. There is nothing “dedicated” about either fund. Instead, the payroll tax and the income tax slosh together into one big spending pot.","1510","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/08/how-republicans-can-white-house.html"

"But since payroll taxes do fund a portion of Social Security and Medicare, the revenue needs to be replaced. And from a moral point of view, no one should receive a benefit for free and everyone should pay something to fund our government. That means everyone, including low-income Americans, should pay income taxes. Under this plan, low income Americans would no longer be subject to the regressive payroll tax. Instead, like all Americans, they would pay into the progressive income tax.","1512","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/08/how-republicans-can-white-house.html"

"Right now, there is a deduction or a credit for almost every activity known to man - paying alimony, foreign taxes and moving expenses, or installing solar panels, to name just a few. In addition, there are deductions for housing, charity, healthcare, education and child raising. Politicians for decades have jammed government spending into the tax code in an effort to look like tax cutters.","1514","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/08/how-republicans-can-white-house.html"
"The purpose of the tax code should be to raise the money necessary to pay the government’s bills. It shouldn’t be the place to hand out benefits to those who qualify. That’s what government spending is for. If a program has merit, spend money on it. If it doesn’t, it shouldn’t be hidden as a “tax cut” in the tax code.","1515","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/08/how-republicans-can-white-house.html"
"Imagine a Congress in which debates about new programs were truly debates about whether – or not – taxpayer money should be spent. I suspect an approach like that would lead to less government spending.","1516","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/08/how-republicans-can-white-house.html"
"The tax code today has so many sacred cows that reformers fear they’ll get stampeded if they try. Maybe that’s one reason people have lost faith in Washington. Too often the national interest, in this instance economic growth for all - has become subservient to those who like the tax code the way it is. But presidential races are about leadership. America is yearning for someone to put the country first, providing an opening to the presidential contender who seizes it.","1517","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/08/how-republicans-can-white-house.html"

"Reconciliation can be used to sync up spending, revenue and adjust the debt ceiling. Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution dictates that bills with revenue implications must start in the House.

"The Senate’s fundamental glory is an unlimited amendment process and unlimited debate. That’s what gives rise to filibuster. But the budget process limits debate, curbs most amendments and requires but a simple majority to adopt legislative items.

"Late last week Inhofe's charges took on new immediacy after 15 U.S. states ranging from West Virginia and Florida to Ohio and Michigan filed suit against the EPA's fast-track scheduling for the plan, which demands that states carry out an average 32 percent reduction in carbon emissions from existing electrical power generation facilities by 2030.","1631","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/18/republicans-states-attack-new-epa-power-plant-rule.html"
"The EPA's Aug. 3 ""final rule"" on the reductions, which the agency has touted for its ""flexibility,"" gives all U.S. states just 13 months to come up with initial proposals on how they intend to carry out the objective -- or federal agency could impose a plan for them.

"They argue that the EPA timetable for states to cut back on carbon-based fuels and ""fundamentally reorganize their energy grids"" is impossible to achieve, would force them to discard billions in on-going energy efficiency investments, and short-circuits the kind of careful study required for such drastic changes.","1635","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/18/republicans-states-attack-new-epa-power-plant-rule.html"
"The EPA's hurry-up timetable is far less than the amount of time that EPA itself took to come up with the Clean Power Plan. That span was allotted under a controversial ""sue and settle"" agreement with a variety of environmental lobbying organizations, including NRDC, and a grouping of liberal states that was initially signed in 2010 -- and subsequently amended by the collaborating parties as the agency grappled with different approaches to the carbon emissions issue.","1636","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/18/republicans-states-attack-new-epa-power-plant-rule.html"
"The frequent give-and-take between the partners to such a voluntary agreement -- which take place outside the normal process of public comment on agency rule-making-is one of the major reasons why the sue-and-settle process has been widely criticized by EPA critics and notably by Inhofe, as giving the agreement insiders a special priority.","1637","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/18/republicans-states-attack-new-epa-power-plant-rule.html"

"In February 2014, the New York Times seemed to agree with the notion of NRDC's influence. It declared that EPA ""is looking closely at a proposal by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit group, that could well be the heart of the regulation: states could comply with the rule not just by cleaning or shutting down coal plants, but also by making far broader changes across the electricity system-reducing demand, investing in 'smart grid' technology or supporting more renewable sources of energy.""","1641","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/18/republicans-states-attack-new-epa-power-plant-rule.html"

"SUPREME DELIVERANCE FOR GOP Republicans may not much agree with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn state bans on same-sex marriage, but just like the other ruling this week sparing ObamaCare, it is a political deliverance for their party. Had the court rejected the case and restored same-sex marriage bans struck down by lower courts, the Republican 2016 field would have been in a quandary. With a socially conservative base but a general electorate that has shifted dramatically on the subject in the past decade, GOP contenders would have been obliged to take positions on 31 state bans that were resurrected by the court. The list would have included swing states Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida and each candidate would have had to take a position on the subject. No good answers – either flip-flop or be called an extremist. Managing to anger social conservatives directly and libertarians by way of precedent for judicial activism, the high court has stoked a righteous anger on the right. While Republicans may be increasingly accepting of gay marriage, its imposition by court order will hardly enhance the good vibes. But there is enormous relief among GOP strategists that this issue is mostly off the table for 2016. As it stands, social conservatives can call for a federal amendment to reverse the decision – as Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., already has – but since there is no chance of a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and not even likely to be a vote, this comes with lower risk. Moreover, the Republican base, already inflamed over fears of lost religious liberty, will bring a new focus to the subject and new activists and donors for the cause. The target will shift from the social issue itself to the issue of government and religious overreach. No matter who the Republicans nominate, Hillary Clinton will declare them to be extremists on the subject of gay marriage. But as of today, the Supreme Court has declared the issue moot. Hillary, Obama take credit for gay marriage trend they resisted - WaPo: “Hillary Clinton's campaign is list-building off the [Supreme Court decision on same sex marriage] while President Obama spoke at an LGBT Pride event at the White House Wednesday, where he noted that the number of states in which same-sex couples can marry has grown from two when he took office to 37 today. ‘A decade ago politicians ran against LGBT rights; today, they're running towards them,’ he said. What was left unsaid, of course, was that he and Clinton are among those who used to run against same-sex marriage but have since changed their tune. … In fact, they jumped on-board well after gay marriage attained overwhelming majority support among Democrats. Obama came out in support of same-sex marriage in 2012, and Clinton in 2013, half a decade after a majority of Democrats already supported it in public polling.” DIVIDE ON EMAILS THREATENS HILLARY’S STORY Fox News: “The State Department said Thursday it cannot locate 15 work-related emails from Hillary Clinton's private server released this week by the committee probing the 2012 Benghazi attacks -- indicating she never turned them over, in a revelation the committee chairman described as ‘significant and troubling.’ The emails consist of more in a series of intelligence reports passed to her by longtime political confidant Sidney Blumenthal, officials told The Associated Press. … When asked for comment by Fox News, a Clinton official said ‘not only did she turn over all emails that she had from Blumenthal, she actually turned over more than a dozen emails that were not included in what he handed over to the House committee. We do not have a record of other correspondence between her and Mr. Blumenthal beyond that which was turned over to the State Department. In terms of the documents provided by Mr. Blumenthal to the House committee, we do not recognize many of those materials and cannot speak to their origin,’ the official said.” The takeaway - A crack has emerged between Hillary Clinton and her former team at the State Department. Her process for culling the emails was demonstrably flawed and now further open to charges of wrongdoing. The choice to destroy 31,000 emails looks increasingly suspect. The campaign may hang Blumenthal out to dry on this, but this becomes a stickier web all the time. Prosecutors know the way to win is to divide the suspects, and that may be what congressional investigators are doing. Wut? Sanders down to single-digit deficit in Granite State Poll - WMUR:“Less than two months ago, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held a 21 percentage point lead over her nearest competitor in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary campaign. Now, her edge is down to 8 percentage points over Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton leads Sanders, 43 to 35 percent, in a new WMUR/CNN Granite State Poll, which was conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center from June 18 to 24. The poll included 360 likely 2016 Democratic primary voters and has a margin of error of 5.2 percent, meaning Sanders is close to being in a statistical dead heat with the frontrunner.” McAuliffe re-emerges as Hillary’s inside man - Politico: “[Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe] a former Democratic National Committee chairman and a consummate political animal, just can’t keep his fingers away from the flame. Despite the daily demands of running the state he was elected to lead in 2013, he’s emerging as Hillary’s informal liaison to governors and the party’s biggest donors, while also keeping a finger on the pulse of the camp’s central operations in Brooklyn.” EULOGY OFFERS OBAMA ANOTHER CHANCE FOR RESET ON RACE WashEx: “[President Obama] Vice President Joe Biden, and [first lady] Michelle Obama will travel to South Carolina to pay tribute to the Rev. Clementa Pinckney and eight other victims of last week's mass murder at an historic black church in Charleston. The Senate is out, and the House has canceled votes so members can attend memorial services for the victims, who were shot during a Bible study. The president came to know Pinckney, pastor of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and a state senator, when he was an early supporter of Obama's 2008 White House campaign.” Power Play: Clinton’s gambit - After Charleston, Hillary Clinton moved race to the forefront of her campaign. Is her outreach to African American voters smart or is she overplaying her hand? National Journal’s Emily Schultheis and The Hill’s Kevin Cirilli discuss the strategy with Chris Stirewalt.

Smithsonian Magazine took a look at the development of mustard, and how this tiny seed survived over time. Mustard is from the Brassicaceae family – a tough bunch that developed a defenses, called glucosinolates by scientists but more commonly known as the mustard oil that gives its flavor to horseradish, cabbage and, of course, mustard. These evolving compounds create a deterrent so if the insects do consume them they will get sick or die. Over time, though, insects developed their own defense so they can consume the plants without injuring themselves.

"This scenario only works, however, if Hispanics agree to play the role of oppressed and angry “people of color.” And that seems unlikely.

"In this way, Hispanics resemble earlier immigrant groups. In the last century, America warily absorbed large groups of Irish, Italian, Greek and Jewish newcomers.

"The new arrivals of the 20th Century were the butts of crude ethnic humor, nasty stereotypes and sometimes blatant discrimination. Here and there they suffered violent attacks.

"When Hispanics tell census takers and Pew pollsters that they consider themselves “white,” they are not making a statement about the color of their skin or the racial history of their family.

"HILLARY: TRUMP, REPUBLICANS ALL ALIKE Under the battle cry that all Republicans are Trump, Hillary Clinton fired a shotgun blast at her GOP rivals Monday saying, “While what Donald Trump said about Megyn Kelly is outrageous, what the rest of the Republicans are saying about all women is also outrageous.” The Democratic frontrunner has consistently sought to lump all Republicans together in a renewal of her party’s claim of a GOP war on women. This time the target was Sen. Marco Rubio on abortion. “When one of their major candidates, a much younger man, the senator from Florida, says there should be no exceptions for rape and incest, that is as offensive and as troubling a comment as you can hear from a major candidate running for the presidency,” Clinton said. Rubio wasted no time slamming back with a statement which said in part, “Hillary Clinton supports abortion even at the stage when an unborn child can feel pain…Hillary Clinton holds radical views on abortion that we look forward to exposing in the months to come.” While Clinton’s move to tar her Republican rivals with a broad brush is aimed at shoring up a base that has seen erosion in support among white women, it is also a reflection of her campaign’s concern over Rubio, who a recent a swing state poll showed is a top threat in a head-to-head matchup. [But I really don’t know Trump ‘that well’ - “I didn’t know him that well. I mean, I knew him. I knew him and I happened to be planning to be in Florida and I thought it’d be fun to go to his wedding, because it’s always entertaining…Now that he’s running for president, it’s a little more troubling,” said Clinton at a New Hampshire press conference.] Hillary’s nets a mil from who-knows-who? - Doubling down her recent criticism of “the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money,” this election cycle, AP reports that Clinton got a big dollar bounce from anonymous donors. “[T]he main super PAC backing her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination accepted a $1 million contribution that cannot be traced. The seven-figure donation, made June 29 to the pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action, came from another super political action committee, called Fair Share Action. Its two lone contributors are Fair Share Inc. and Environment America Inc., according to records filed with Federal Election Commission. Those two groups are nonprofits that are not legally required to reveal information about their donors.” Hillary vows all the emails are out there - NYT: “Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement filed under oath in federal court on Monday that she had provided to the State Department all of the work-related emails that were on the personal email account she used exclusively while she was secretary of state.” [Déjà vu: State to miss Hillary email deadline - WashEx: “State Department officials will not publish the required number of Hillary Clinton’s emails at the end of August, marking the second month in a row that the agency has failed to meet a court-ordered benchmark for the production of the records.”] Hillary lays out college plan: No loans for public schools - USA Today: “The multi-pronged plan includes giving grants to states to make them partners in a pledge that no student should have to take out a loan to pay for tuition if attending a four-year public college in their state. It would require students to help pay their way through school by contributing based on what they earn from 10 hours of work per week. And, echoing a plan already proposed by President Obama, students would be able to attend community college for free.” [Hillary and Jeb waged a daylong Twitter-photoshop battle over the plan: Mashable has the deets] Nurses side with Bernie - WSJ: “A major union of nurses endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for president Monday, posing a hurdle to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as she works to lock down support from key elements of her party’s base. The endorsement—the first Mr. Sanders has received from a national union—marked a big win for the candidate and comes after Mrs. Clinton last month won the backing of the American Federation of Teachers.” [More big crowds for Bernie - over 70,000 in three speeches Bloomberg reports.] Laura Ingalls for Congress! No really… - Detroit Free Press: “Actress Melissa Gilbert, best known for her portrayal of Laura Ingalls Wilder on NBC’s “Little House on the Prairie” in the 1970s and ‘80s, said Monday she will run for Congress in Michigan’s 8th District -- though her campaign will have to tamp down questions about a tax bill.” TAKE FIVE: WHAT DO YOU SAY?

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… With state fairs popping up all over the country this time of year many people will consume delicious local cuisine from a parked truck. You have ancient Rome to thank for the concept, reports CTV. Street food vendors come from a need to feed nearly 50 million people leading very busy lives (sound familiar?). And Ancient Romans did not play around when it came to food. Emperors could be toppled over a lack of proper sustenance for their people, and Romans were known to center their days around several feedings, including snacking. Food-on-the-go became a necessity and, in such a vast expanding place, returning home was not always an option. Vendor foods included salted peas at the Coliseum, or some fried fish after a public bath. So when you’re indulging in a turkey leg followed up by a deep-fried Oreo proudly declare “Civis romanus sum.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Jeb Bush, R-Fla., is taking the gloves off in a speech at the Reagan Library today that not-so-subtly accuses Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, of contributing to the rise of ISIS. Name-checking Clinton, Bush says that early withdrawal from the Middle East, and a continued refusal to acknowledge Islamic extremism, allowed the radical group free reign over the region. In pre-released remarks Bush says, “ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat. And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the president himself, she had opposed the surge…then joined in claiming credit for its success … then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away.” SOUND OFF: READER RESPOND TO 2016 GOP POWER INDEX “To have Jeb Bush as the front runner is a joke, because the only people that want him in office is the entrenched establishment, people like Karl Rove.” – Mark Ritsig “In time, those on the radar will eventually fall OFF completely, joined by Huckabee, Carson, Paul, and hopefully Trump. Still going with a Rubio/Walker, Rubio/Kasich or even Rubio/Bush ticket.” – Madeline Schwarz “Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina, in either order, are our top choices for the seat(s) of the President and Vice President of the U.S. Each of them is calm under duress; both are extremely knowledgeable in world affairs” – Dale and Natalie Tenny Carly says she’ll support Trump nominee to unite the party - Daily Caller: “Carly Fiorina says that she will support Donald Trump if he is the eventual Republican nominee. Appearing on the Hugh Hewitt Show Monday, Fiorina clarified that, ‘If you’re going to run as a Republican in a primary, then you need to be clear that you are actually a Republican.’ Fiorina continued with, ‘Uniting the party after a nomination contest, so that we can beat our opponent is the most important thing.’” Cruz bus tour draws crowds in Tennessee - [Nashville] Tennessean: “Sen. Ted Cruz…revved up members of his Middle Tennessee base with a preacher’s energy Monday afternoon during a talk that drew about 1,600 sign-toting, button-wearing supporters to The Factory at Franklin…It was one of four stops that Cruz was set to make throughout the state.” [Watch Fox: Chief Political Correspondent Campaign Carl Cameron has the latest on the road from Ted Cruz’s Southern state bus tour.] Perry peoples’ pay plight - WaPo: “[Perry]…has stopped paying his staff at the national headquarters in Austin as well as in the early caucus and primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to a Republican familiar with the Perry campaign. [Former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas] campaign manager Jeff Miller told staff last Friday, the day after the first Republican presidential debate, that they would no longer be paid and are free to look for other jobs -- and, so far at least, most aides have stuck with Perry -- according to this Republican.” [Pro-Perry Opportunity and Freedom PAC tweeted out, “We’ve got plenty of money...The super PAC is not going to let Rick Perry down.”] CLUB FOR GROWTH PICKS FAVE FIVE WSJ: “The five candidates for which the Club will officially bundle campaign contributions are: Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a leading contender for the nomination who has struggled to gain traction with some conservatives.” TALE OF THE FLYING FISH FOX 5: “A man fishing on Crystal Pier in Pacific Beach had a rare catch – a drone flying overhead – and it was caught on video…A fisherman in particular appeared annoyed that the drone was flying overhead. He was seen casting his line toward the drone and nabbed it. The drone attempted to move out of the way, but was hooked. The pilot, 19 year old Tice Ledbetter, apparently was able to land the drone without damaging it. He unraveled the line and posted the video to YouTube.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “Donald Trump decided to make this into a war on the moderators and a war on Fox is because I think he thinks he lost. If you win a debate, you don’t start a war attacking the moderators. And he succeeded, he's a brilliant showman. He has succeeded in taking all the attention away from what actually happened in the debate.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"This year alone, the two largest for-profit college chains in the country came under heightened scrutiny—and another one collapsed outright. In April, the Department of Education levied a $30 million fine against for-profit giant Corinthian Colleges Inc. for its misrepresentation of job placement rates. On hundreds of occasions, Corinthian lied to students about their job prospects as part of recruitment, promising them high-quality jobs on real career ladders in exchange for their tuition dollars and hard work.","1783","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/why-want-republicans-to-debate-for-profit-colleges.html"

Compare that to public community colleges, where more than 80 percent of revenue goes to instruction, and you can see that for-profit colleges are just that—for profits, not for students.","1785","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/why-want-republicans-to-debate-for-profit-colleges.html"

His degree proved to have no value to employers; Gerardo made less than he did with just a high school diploma.

"But despite his many critics, Trump remains at the top of GOP primary polls in a fragmented and large field. Shunning Trump risks making him even more of a hero to voters who feel alienated from national politics. In Tuesday's Fox News poll Donald Trump continues to gain ground in the race for the Republican nomination. What’s more, the number of GOP primary voters saying they would at least consider backing Trump has more than doubled in the last two months.

"In fact, the Journal poll found that since its prior poll, taken a month earlier, more Republican primary voters are picking Trump as their second choice.

Pew polling has it at 32 percent, and the biggest drop has come among Republicans, only 68 percent of whom give their party a positive rating. The party has also lost ground among independent voters – down to 29 percent favorability – and those voters are key to winning elections.","1892","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"The advice from top political strategists is for Walker and Bush, who will likely be on either side of Trump and within the frame of most camera angles of Trump, to keep the smirks off their faces.

"The morning-after test for Trump will be his entertainment value and his ability to answer serious questions about policy. A caustic comment or two will light up the Twitter universe and satisfy the bloodlust among viewers tuning in for a fight. But the reigning champion of the early Republican primary contest has to show he can get serious on issues of critical concern if he wants to keep his crown at the end of the night.","1897","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"Walker’s plainspoken delivery is appealing, but he has yet to show a grasp of national or international issues, and he has flip-flopped on big issues like immigration, ethanol subsidies and Common Core education standards. In the high-pressure, sound-bite-driven forum of a debate, he risks coming across as callow and uninformed. Can he avoid looking like he is in over his head?","1900","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"Because he got into the race so early, Bush was able to lock up most of the big money donations and establishment support. This has given him a firewall to withstand the Trump surge. Donors and party stalwarts loyal to his father and brother have stuck with him this far, but a poor debate performance will unlock the gates of political anxiety, and that might start a rush of people with deep pockets to other candidates.","1902","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"
"Bush has not backed down on his support for Common Core and comprehensive immigration reform. This consistency will help him if he makes it to the general election, but it puts two big targets on his back in this debate. Trump and the other candidates are going to come at him hard from the right on both issues. Bush needs to make it clear that he is not a flip-flopper, that he is seriously committed to his positions and that he cares more about people than about playing expedient political games for short-term benefits.","1903","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"Keep your eye on Dr. Carson. He could well be the breakthrough star of Thursday night’s debate. His humble, calm and thoughtful demeanor is a powerful contrast to the bluster and hot rhetoric of Trump. Carson needs to make the case to the GOP base that his quiet, reserved form of conservatism is better for the health of the party than Trump. And with Carly Fiorina, the former corporate manager, not likely to qualify for the primetime debate, he will stand out on the all-male stage as the only person who is not white.","1905","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"In the last few weeks the polls have not been kind to Sen. Rubio. The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll over the weekend gave him 5 percent. A Monmouth University Pol released Monday has him at 4.4 percent. Those numbers constitute a big drop from May when he was at 14 percent support in the Real Clear Politics report which averages the results of major polls. But the Florida senator is still popular among Republicans who give him a high favorable rating and he still remains near the top when voters select their second choice. So Rubio’s goal on the debate stage is to show off his knowledge on big issues, especially foreign policy, and remind voters why they once had him as their first choice.","1907","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"Wouldn’t it have been great to be a fly on the wall for Cruz’s private meeting with Trump in New York last month? The Texas senator is one of the most cynical and calculating politicians. He apparently has no interest in returning to the U.S. Senate after blowing up his relationships there by calling Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a “liar.”","1909","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"
"At the moment, Cruz’s best hope is that Trump will collapse long before the first votes are cast and that Trump’s anti-establishment supporters will shift to him. He has done well in fundraising and can afford to wait until that happens.","1910","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"
"One exciting possibility: Look for Trump and Cruz to tag team the other candidates. If they train enough fire on one of them, it could well be enough to drive him out of the race.

"Their goal is to be on stage, look good and raise their visibility with voters and donors. Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul are not looking to fight with Trump. There is no gain for them in that game. If Trump falls, Huckabee and Paul want to be alternatives for his backers in their search for a better anti-establishment candidate. To that end they must avoid mistakes before getting back to retail politics in Iowa and New Hampshire.","1913","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"
"As for the candidates who do not qualify for the primetime debate, they will be on television for a one-hour debate at 5 p.m. on Thursday. Polls show most voters don’t know Fiorina, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Their goal is to say hello to the voters and make a positive impression. A shot at Trump from Perry or Graham, who have a record of butting heads with the billionaire front-runner, will generate headlines. But their energy is better invested in delivering a message that sets them apart on any issue as serious and passionate and deserving of a second look before their campaigns fade to black.","1914","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"Supporters of the plan, including many in the oil and gas industry, essentially argue that lifting the ban would help the U.S. economy.

"However, calls to lift the ban, the result of the 1970’s energy crisis, have also brought out critics. And they have resulted in conflicting reports about the potential impact of adding billions of barrels of U.S. crude oil to world markets -- from gas prices increasing at pumps across the county to oil prices plummeting around the globe to the reaction from the 12-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).","2031","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/as-us-energy-output-surges-capitol-hill-republicans-lead-effort-to-lift-decades.html"

"However, a top Senate staff told FoxNews.com after the Iran deal was struck Tuesday that Murkowski has no intentions of holding up a major foreign policy vote or international trade legislation over lifting the ban, likely references to the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact being debated in Congress and the upcoming votes on the Iran nuclear deal.","2041","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/19/as-us-energy-output-surges-capitol-hill-republicans-lead-effort-to-lift-decades.html"

"Let’s be clear. The fight over marriage equality isn’t about religious freedom or the criminalization of Christianity. States have regularly taken action to enact civil marriage with clear exemptions and protections for churches, synagogues and other religious entities.

According to a recent CNN/ORC survey, the highest percentage of Americans ever, 63%, support the freedom to marry as a constitutional right for gay couples. This is an increase of 14% since 2010 and shows significant gains across all party lines. Regardless of what the U.S. Supreme Court decides this term, the American Public is already on the side of marriage equality.

"Along with the general public, support for the freedom to marry has increasingly gained acceptance among senior Republicans on Capitol Hill. Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced their support of marriage equality in recent years. And just this spring, twenty-three current and former members of Congress, including Senators Mark Kirk (Ill.) and Susan Collins (Maine) and Representatives Curbelo (Fla.), Dold (Ill.), Hanna (N.Y.), Gibson (N.Y.), and Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.) added their names to a Republican amicus brief arguing in support of marriage equality cases presently before the U.S. Supreme Court.","2072","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/06/01/its-time-for-republican-party-leaders-to-embrace-marriage-equality.html"

"What’s the value of a diverse field of candidates? First, it advances the argument that the GOP is the real party of opportunity, and blunts Democratic attempts to portray the Republican Party as an exclusive country club for white males. Second, it might also help broaden the party’s appeal to “non-traditional” voters who would never think of voting for a Republican. And third, the pressure is on Clinton, or whoever turns out to be the Democratic nominee, to put together a more substantive outreach effort to keep minorities in the fold. When it comes to diversity, conservatives often play defense.

In just a few weeks, the high court will render its decision in King v. Burwell, a case evaluating the qualification of subsidies for the health care law. The Supreme Court could impale the ACA, ruling subsidies unconstitutional for some ObamaCare beneficiaries. Such an outcome could be catastrophic for the law. It also means that Republicans -- having talked a good game for years with little to show for it -- had better turn up their dials to capture that ""Wow!"" broadcast. The onus is on them.","2169","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/28/republicans-keep-scanning-horizon-for-path-to-scrap-replace-obamacare.html"
"A working group of key House members has prepped for Supreme Court scenarios for months. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline, R-Minn., and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., are the players here. They want to give states the chance to sidestep mandates which compel people to purchase insurance and void requirements that companies provide care for their employees. The trio also wants states to have the option to back away from ObamaCare.","2170","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/28/republicans-keep-scanning-horizon-for-path-to-scrap-replace-obamacare.html"

"It's anybody's guess, though, if these members will get the traction necessary to move a bill on the floor. Then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., spearheaded a working group a few years ago to find an ObamaCare replacement plan. No accord ever materialized. The reason Republicans never put an ObamaCare replacement bill on the floor is because the GOP rank-and-file never coalesced around a plan which could pass.","2172","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/28/republicans-keep-scanning-horizon-for-path-to-scrap-replace-obamacare.html"
"Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., faces a potentially tough re-election in a swing state next year. Mindful of the policy calamity which could upend Capitol Hill after the Supreme Court ruling, the Wisconsin Republican authored a bill to maintain the subsidies for health care -- but only for a few more years. In exchange, the Obama administration would have to end the individual and employer mandates for insurance.","2173","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/28/republicans-keep-scanning-horizon-for-path-to-scrap-replace-obamacare.html"
"But past is prologue here. It's anyone's guess if Johnson's idea could vault two parliamentary hurdles and secure supermajorities just to get the bill on the floor and stave off a filibuster.

It's unlikely that staunch conservatives would vote for anything short of a full, unvarnished repeal.","2174","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/28/republicans-keep-scanning-horizon-for-path-to-scrap-replace-obamacare.html"

"Health care is front and center Thursday in Washington. Last summer, the House of Representatives voted to sue the Obama administration over taking ""unilateral actions"" in administering the ACA.

"The House alleges that the administration waived the employer mandate when it shouldn't have. Ironically, most conservatives want to dump the employer mandate. But they didn't like it when the administration altered the terms of that mandate without congressional action. Moreover, the House says the law spends money which Congress never allocated toward implementing the law. The House contends that subverts the Constitution.","2177","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/28/republicans-keep-scanning-horizon-for-path-to-scrap-replace-obamacare.html"

"The House's lawsuit certainly does a lot for the GOP base and energizes Republican members -- eager to demonstrate that Obama extends his reach beyond constitutional parameters. That may be so.

"The president met with House Democratic leaders ahead of a caucus meeting. While it is extremely rare for a president to make a visit like this before a big vote, the last-minute lobbying comes after the president also made a surprise appearance at the annual congressional baseball game between Democrats and Republicans the night before.

"This wasn’t quite the drunken, Bronx throng at Yankee Stadium cantillating “Reg-GIE! Reg-GIE! Reg-GIE!” after Reggie Jackson swatted three consecutive home runs in Game Six of the 1977 World Series.

"TPA, which would give the president the ability to ""fast-track"" future trade deals, is one of two bills due up in the House on Friday. And it’s anybody’s guess if the bills will pass. Members of Congress may have been mixing it up on the diamond. But there is just as much gamesmanship underway on Capitol Hill as lawmakers try to leverage passage or defeat of the trade legislation.","2195","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"First, the basics.","2196","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"Most House Republicans want to approve TPA. But they don’t quite have the votes to do it on their own. They need Democratic support. Yet the irony is that even though Obama is pushing the deal, only about 20-plus House Democrats support their own chief executive on this issue.","2197","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"So various political gambits kick in.","2198","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"Republicans find it absurd that Obama can’t persuade more than two-dozen Democratic members to support the trade plan. Conversely, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is stunned that House Republicans, boasting a 246-188 majority, can’t excavate at least 200 GOPers to approve the package.","2199","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"So Pelosi and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, cut a deal. Neither side promised a certain number of votes to the other.

"Pelosi and Boehner engineered a deal to advance the trade framework to the floor – so long as Democrats scored a vote on something called Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA).","2201","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"TAA is a program near and dear to the hearts of many Democrats. It’s a method to cushion the blow for various workers and industries damaged by business reallocations in trade agreements. So House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., teed up two votes for Friday: One for TAA and one on TPA. But a TPA vote was contingent on the House first adopting TAA. The procedural maneuver would require Republicans to carry most of the freight to adopt TPA. But to get there, Democrats would be expected to provide the lion’s share of votes for TAA. If the House doesn’t approve TAA, everything comes to a screeching halt and there’s no vote on TPA.","2202","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"

And then there’s Pelosi – stuck in the middle.","2204","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"On trade, Pelosi is a switch-pitcher. She’s trying to keep the Democratic caucus from embarrassing Obama with a paltry vote total for TPA. Yet she’s working to make sure most of her caucus gets what it wants: a defeat of TPA. At the same time, Pelosi secured a deal for the TAA vote – which could help pass TPA … or blow it up.","2205","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"Major League Baseball has a rule for ambidextrous pitchers, few as there may be. Such cross-hurlers must first declare whether they intend to pitch left-handed or right-handed to each batter.

"But Democrats are working against Pelosi. A senior House GOP leadership source says Republicans can only provide 50 to 70 votes for TAA. Democrats must make up the difference.

Some intend to vote no on TAA simply to detonate the entire process and never get the TPA bill to the floor -- which they so despise.","2207","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"

Clinton’s Super PACs raised $24.3 million. If you add that to her total, as she does with the GOP, her total is $71 million.

"Republican officials, after battling for years with Washington over ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion, are testing a middle ground that could reshape the program – by making recipients pay for part of their health care.","Published July 16, 2015","2494","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"Indiana has gone the furthest with this plan, but other states are enacting or debating similar measures. While some worry making low-income recipients pay for part of their Medicaid costs is unfair, the change is notable in that the Obama administration is not fighting it tooth and nail.","2495","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"“It’s a very fluid scenario,” said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. “There’s now a handful of states that are engaged in direct negotiations with CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] or are having [a] back-and-forth debate within their house.”","2496","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"Indiana, led by GOP Gov. Mike Pence, approved the Healthy Indiana Plan in February. In doing so, the state replaced traditional Medicaid and expanded it, as sought under ObamaCare – something a number of Republican-led states have still not done.","2497","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"The catch: Indiana’s plan requires recipients pay for part of the cost. In order to get insurance, recipients would pay monthly premiums (based on income, ranging from $1 to $27), in addition to various co-payments (anywhere from $4 to $75). If a recipient pays their premiums on time, they can qualify for expanded benefits and have co-pays limited to only non-emergency ER visits.","2498","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"If it works, it would be a breakthrough for GOP-led states that want to expand Medicaid and cover the uninsured – yet don’t want the program to be an all-expenses-paid entitlement. About 297,000 Indiana residents have enrolled in the program as of July 1. The state says 72 percent are paying their premiums on time.","2499","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"

"Indiana’s plan relies solely on its own resources, but Pence says it “will require no new state spending and no new taxes.” The Healthy Indiana Plan will be financed by state cigarette tax revenue and fees collected from hospitals. State figures estimate that the program will cost $1.63 billion.","2501","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"

"Indiana, though, went a step further. The state’s plan was unprecedented because it says recipients can lose coverage for not paying premiums.","2503","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"Alaska, Montana, Utah, and Tennessee are now debating similar shared-cost proposals – borrowing elements from the Indiana plan -- according to Salo.

"“The Healthy Indiana Plan … is aspirational,” Brian Neale, Pence’s health policy director, told the Los Angeles Times. “We believe that individuals, if offered the opportunity, will make the right choices.” The plan requires recipients to contribute to a health savings account that tracks medical expenses. Patients get care as long as they make their payments, and can lower their rates by getting various preventive care.","2505","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"But charging poor patients can be problematic. Studies show that charging premiums and co-pays, and penalizing people for excessive emergency room visits, typically steers poor people away from the doctor’s office.","2506","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"“People don’t get necessary care,” Judith Solomon, a health analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told the Los Angeles Times.

"But the federal government has become more open to alternative plans.","2508","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"In late January, then-CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner approved Indiana’s waivers and congratulated the state on its program.

"ObamaCare itself calls for Medicaid to be extended to childless adults making up to 138 percent of the poverty line. The Supreme Court, however, ruled the expansion optional for states in 2012. Twenty states remain resistant to any expansions. Indiana originally was in that group, but reversed course with its cost-sharing plan.","2510","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"Salo said the program represents a deep change in philosophy, bringing a conservative approach to a longstanding entitlement. “What you’re seeing from more conservative states is that they want more consumer engagement in health care … skin in the game,” he said.","2511","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"
"Further, Salo said Pence is “a bona-fide conservative red state governor” and it may be “hard for other states to say Medicaid can’t be a conservative thing.”","2512","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html"

"The Iowa straw poll has been lauded by conservative activists in the state for decades but in recent years hasn’t been widely embraced by GOP candidates both inside and outside the state.

"The Iowa poll has been held every election cycle since 1979 without a Republican incumbent in the White House.

"First, on ObamaCare. Let’s be honest: Chief Justice John Roberts and his politically aligned brethren just did Republicans a big favor. In affirming that some six million Americans can continue to collect ObamaCare insurance subsidies, notwithstanding their residence in states that have failed to set up their own exchanges, and in spite of the letter and intent of the law, the Supreme Court saved the GOP from another embarrassing intermural shoot-out.","2545","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/06/26/why-supreme-court-rulings-on-obamacare-gay-marriage-and-property-rights-bolster-gop-2016-prospects.html"
"In the lead-up to the court’s decision, Republican presidential hopefuls had already trotted out competing plans for dealing with an expected blow to ObamaCare.

"A day before the 2014 election, in which Republicans took control of the Senate, pollster Scott Rasmussen called ObamaCare the “defining issue” of that political cycle. It was a rallying cry for conservatives across the country, even though the White House had purposefully postponed some of the bill’s least popular elements, in hopes of avoiding a rout. They delayed the employer mandate for companies with between 50 and 99 employees until 2016, and reduced the coverage requirement for bigger firms in 2015. Also, since President Obama’s promise that “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,"" turned out to be PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year, the administration attempted damage control by giving people up to an extra two years to buy insurance that was compliant with the new law.","2548","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/06/26/why-supreme-court-rulings-on-obamacare-gay-marriage-and-property-rights-bolster-gop-2016-prospects.html"

"In the coming election, ObamaCare will again take center stage. Insurance companies are beginning the process of applying for premium hikes, and some are huge – substantially above 20% for various key providers in Illinois, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Florida, for instance. As companies assess their results for the past year, they have a better idea of costs, which appear to have exceeded expectations. Also, the White House delayed phasing out a reinsurance program that compensated insurers for high costs and allowed them to keep premium hikes modest. The loss of that federal money will push rates higher.","2550","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/06/26/why-supreme-court-rulings-on-obamacare-gay-marriage-and-property-rights-bolster-gop-2016-prospects.html"

"They will also look for candidates vowing to protect private property rights and the rights of communities to enforce zoning and other policies that sometimes result in racially imbalanced neighborhoods. The court’s decision means that statistics alone are sufficient to define discrimination, even if that outcome is unintended. So, if two-acre zoning leads to high home prices, which in turn prove unaffordable for blacks or Hispanics, for instance, your town can be sued for discrimination. It’s a horror – not only to communities but also to lenders. The unintended consequence could well be another spurt of lending to people with low credit ratings by banks hoping not to be prosecuted for discrimination.

"The court’s third decision makes same-sex marriage legal in every state. It raises alarms over issues of religious liberty, for example throwing some doubt on the rights of religious schools to retain their tax exemptions.

"This isn’t to suggest that any of the seven Republican presidential candidates in Thursday’s first Republican debate in Cleveland is destined for their name in bright lights, much less sell out stadiums. We are talking about a small chorus of hopefuls who, for this debate, were relegated to the opening act because they couldn’t crack 3% in an average of national polls.","2658","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"

"And that would be Carly Fiorina.","2660","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"
"Why her?","2661","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"
"Because of what happened less than 15 minutes into the nearly 90 minutes of candidates’ chatter.","2662","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"

"After taking the obligatory pot-shot at Donald Trump for donating to both Clintons’ causes, Fiorina demonstrated both a Realpolitik grasp and a rhetorical succinctness – skills not often display in the current crop of Republicans – in acknowledging that there’s something bigger afoot in this election than one magnate’s ego.","2664","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"
"In Fiorina’s words: “[Trump] is the party’s frontrunner right now and good for him. I think he’s tapped into an anger that people feel – they’re sick of politics as usual. You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hope would be resolved, the political class has failed you. That’s just a fact and that’s what Donald Trump has tapped into.”","2665","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"
"Such is the stuff of wise debate tactics. By alluding to “the political class,” Fiorina instantly separated herself from the six current and former incumbents standing astride her on the Cleveland stage. As for “anger”: along with the electorate’s appetite for celebrity-born bluff and bravado (California recall election, anybody?), it’s why Trump raked in 26 percent of self-identified Republican primary voters in the latest Fox News Poll.","2666","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"
"Fiorina’s gained notice this spring and summer for her harsh critiques of Hillary Clinton. That line of attack scores with small crowds of activists for who mention of Mrs. Clinton is fingernails on a chalkboard. Besides, the media love the notion of a partisan catfight between Mrs. Clinton and the lone female candidate on the GOP side. But it’s not translating at the national level: for the Fox debate, Fiorina placed 14th in the field of 17 contenders.","2667","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"

"How about message tweaking?","2669","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"
"Fiorina should stop focusing on Hillary Clinton, the ultimate insider, and instead take advantage of her Republican outsider persona to broaden her conservative and libertarian appeal. She’s one of only three non-politicians in the 2016 GOP field (Ben Carson and Trump being the others). As such, Fiorina can tap into the same dismay over a host of Establishment Republican foibles and failures that has Trump, Carson and Ted Cruz in the upper crust of hopefuls.","2670","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"
"Besides, if Fiorina and six other Republicans on that stage watch the video of what transpired in Cleveland, they’ll understand the dire need to avoid a second relegation to second-tier status.","2671","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"

"Blame Trump, if you like, for the lack of sizzle. But the fact is, with the exception of Fiorina, it was a panel featuring two candidates who missed their chance in 2012 (Rick Perry and Rick Santorum); one senator maybe angling to be the next Secretary of Defense (Lindsey Graham); one governor buried in field of eight other Republicans with the same job title (Bobby Jindal); two former governors who are, for all practical purposes, afterthoughts (George Pataki and Jim Gilmore).","2673","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/carly-fiorina-cuts-through-clutter-at-first-republican-debate.html"

"The chart above shows that Bush cut spending the most. Though he's criticized by conservatives as ""too moderate,"" the former Florida governor cut spending by an average of 1.39 percent each year he was in office. Most cuts came from ""public assistance,"" higher education, and state discretionary spending.","2694","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/fact-check-which-republican-candidates-actually-cut-spending.html"

"This chart, at right, shows that Bush was indeed the biggest budget cutter. During his tenure, Florida's spending shrunk by 3.6 percentage points more than the average. He cut spending by 1.39 percent per year in his state, while other states increased theirs by 2.3 percent during that same period. Kasich was also conservative by this measure, cutting spending 1.76 percentage points more than other states did.","2698","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/fact-check-which-republican-candidates-actually-cut-spending.html"

"""When you scratch below the surface, the governor's fiscal discipline over the budget is more dramatic, with discretionary spending cut to $2.3 billion below where it was in 2008 [a 9 percent cut.] Non-discretionary spending in public employee entitlements and debt service have driven spending and we continue working to reform these programs and control those costs.""","2703","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/fact-check-which-republican-candidates-actually-cut-spending.html"

"""The governor has worked hard to manage the state efficiently, to rein in costs and to cut taxes, and as a result, the state workforce is the lowest it's been in 30 years,"" Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said.","2708","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/fact-check-which-republican-candidates-actually-cut-spending.html"
"The senators running for president have no precise budget track record to nail down, but there are ratings that indicate whether they were fiscally conservative or reckless. The National Taxpayers' Union gives Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a 95 percent rating, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul 94 percent, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio 87 percent.

"Six of those later were flagged and sent termination notices. But GAO said it was able to get five of them reinstated, by calling HealthCare.gov's consumer service center. The five even got their monthly subsidies bumped up a bit, although GAO did not ask for it. The case of the sixth fake enrollee was under review.","2746","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/15/bogus-enrollees-kept-getting-obamacare-probe-finds.html"

A copy was provided to The Associated Press.","2747","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/15/bogus-enrollees-kept-getting-obamacare-probe-finds.html"

"Federal health care subsidies go directly to insurers, so the money does not end up in the bank accounts of individual enrollees.

"Although the administration has terminated coverage for more than 200,000 people who could not prove their citizenship or legal immigrant status, and some 300,000 have had their subsidies changed because of discrepancies over reported income, GAO's bogus beneficiaries largely evaded that dragnet.","2754","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/15/bogus-enrollees-kept-getting-obamacare-probe-finds.html"
"It's unclear whether the fictitious enrollees would have been kicked out of the program eventually. For example, no tax returns were filed on behalf of any of them. Since health insurance subsidies are income-based, tax returns are one of the main ways the government checks applicants.","2755","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/15/bogus-enrollees-kept-getting-obamacare-probe-finds.html"

"Former Governor Jeb Bush failed to excite. His delivery was not crisp, and once again he got himself tangled up answering a question about the Iraq war.

"Governor Chris Christie had a chance to crawl out of the doghouse last night, but barely made it past the door. He got into a shouting match over Rand Paul’s opposition to NSA snooping, with Christie citing his post-September 11 experience as reason to encourage more, not less, intelligence gathering.

"Rand Paul seemed on the defensive, and did not impress. Though the country is tired of war, people are alarmed about ISIS, Iran, China and Russia. Paul’s semi-isolationist stance was an easier sell when our engagements in the Middle East were still building.

"All of them – former California GOP Senate candidate and successful businesswoman Carly Fiorina,, former Texas Governor and once time leading 2012 GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry, former Pennsylvania Senator and 2012 GOP presidential primary runner-up Rick Santorum, Louisiana Governor and the field’s admitted “policy wonk” Bobby Jindal, South Carolina Senator and anti-terrorism hawk Lindsay Graham, former New York Governor and proven bipartisan consensus builder George Pataki, and former Virginia Governor and law-and-order conservative Jim Gilmore – had solid openings.","2908","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/first-republican-debate-which-candidate-can-make-it-to-primetime-next-time.html"
"Except for asking each of them to give a brief two or three word description of Hillary Clinton – they all didn’t have a good word for her – the debate was somewhat unusual in that a question was only asked of a couple of them before moving onto another subject.

"Whatever the subject – Iran, ISIL, economy, Planned Parenthood, immigration, welfare dependence, President Obama’s executive orders, Medicare, government in general, Trump, on down the line – found all 7 giving answers from a standard conservative playbook.

"Rick Perry showed the passion and knowledge that was missing in 2012. Had the Perry of 2015 showed up in 2012, he might have been a threat. But today, 70% of GOP voters in the Gallop Poll say they know him, and give him the 5th best favorable record of any of the 17. So why is he polling so poorly? I think it suggests that no matter what he may do this year, the voters like him still but they are looking for fresh faces.","2913","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/06/first-republican-debate-which-candidate-can-make-it-to-primetime-next-time.html"
"This is the same problem faced by Rick Santorum. He gave the same message as in 2012, the blue collar conservatism that enabled him to win 20% of the primary vote.

"Bobby Jindal has a terrific image already, seventh best of all the contenders with half the voters still undecided. His 4-1 positive rating is excellent.

"Pro-life lawmakers are apoplectic about covert videos purportedly showing Planned Parenthood officials callously discussing harvesting fetal tissue from aborted fetuses.

"Despite Reid's supposition, it's not a certainty that Republicans would affix a rider to a makeshift spending measure. It's politically risky for Republicans to choose that course.

"Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, engineered one potential solution. Collins' idea would address the Planned Parenthood issue without hooking it to the spending bill and opening Pandora's Box.

"Here's the real challenge: Most Senate bills face two procedural hurdles of 60 votes. The first deposits the bill on the floor for debate. The second ends debate and allows the measure to advance to final passage. Senate rules require large chunks of time before those votes ""ripen"" for a roll call.

Though Toomey has tried to position himself as a moderate on issues such as gun control, the former president of the right-wing Club for Growth faces an uphill climb.

"From fiery criticism of ObamaCare and the Iran nuclear deal to support for Israel and the rights of the unborn, the top 10 Republican presidential candidates did all they could to define and separate themselves Thursday night during the Fox News debate in Cleveland, Ohio. The governors on stage, notably John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, touted their economic records. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz vowed to scrap the Iran deal. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson reminded voters in his closing remarks of the professional background that separates him from the rest: “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins.” Throughout the debate, Donald Trump was the unrivaled lightning rod, but the prime-time showdown made clear he’s not the only fighter on the stage – or in the race. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reclaimed his reputation as a tough-talking executive, blasting his rivals for their positions on domestic surveillance and entitlements. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul traded barbs with several candidates, including Christie. Meanwhile, one-time front-runner former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush found himself on defense several times and largely avoided tangling with Trump on the Fox News/Facebook stage. Perhaps the most fiery moment came in an exchange between Christie and Paul. Long-simmering tension between the two exploded when Christie stood by his criticism of the senator for opposing NSA bulk collection of Americans’ phone data. Paul said he’s “proud of standing for the Bill of Rights,” but Christie called his stance “completely ridiculous” – suggesting he wants to cherry-pick only some data. “When you’re sitting in the subcommittee just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that,” Christie said. Paul fired back: “I know you gave [President Obama] a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go ahead.” Christie said the hugs he gave were to the families of 9/11 victims, and then accused Paul of playing “politics,” by using videos of floor speeches to raise money. The exchange was striking, even in a debate that was tense from the start. Though several rivals stood out, Trump did not hold his fire, either – making clear he’s not softening his approach to campaigning as he picks up steam in the polls. If anything, the debate signaled the primary race is about to get tougher and is still wide open as 17 candidates vie for the lead with months to go until the opening contests. Trump, the billionaire businessman front-runner, sparred at the outset of the debate with Paul after refusing to pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee if it’s not him and to swear off an independent run. “I will not make the pledge at this time,” Trump said. Paul accused him of “hedging his bet on the Clintons.” “He’s already hedging his bets, because he’s used to buying politicians,” Paul said. (Trump later acknowledged he gave money to the Clintons and demanded Hillary Clinton “be at my wedding” in exchange; he called this a sign of a broken system.) Trump also stood firm on his vow to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal immigration,” Trump said, blasting “stupid leaders” in the U.S. harboring illegal immigrants. Bush said a comprehensive solution is needed, including a “path to earned legal status,” which he said is not “amnesty.” Moments later, Cruz said some on stage support “amnesty”, while he does not. A big question going into the debate was whether Bush would aggressively challenge Trump and try to knock him off his perch. But he would only go so far as to question Trump’s tone, calling his language “divisive.” Hours before the debate, Politico ran a story saying Bush recently told a donor he thinks Trump is a “buffoon” and a “clown.” Asked about that report on stage, Bush denied it. “It’s not true,” Bush said. Trump then called Bush a “true gentleman.” As for his tone, Trump said it’s “medieval times” in the Middle East, and, “We don’t have time for tone.” But other candidates were able to stand out on the crowded stage. Carson called Hillary Clinton the “epitome” of the progressive movement. “She counts on the fact that people are uninformed. The Alinsky model, taking advantage of useful idiots,” he said. Walker also blasted the Iran nuclear deal, as did other candidates: “This is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS, it is tied together and once and for all we need a leader who is going to do something about it. It is yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio landed laughs when, upon being asked about his faith in God, he said: “I think God has blessed us, he’s blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can’t even find one.” Rubio also vowed to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and called the lack of accountability after the Veterans Affairs scandal “outrageous.” Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee vowed to defend entitlements and stood his ground on social issues. He blasted Planned Parenthood and defended his pro-life views, accusing abortion providers of “selling” fetal parts “like they’re parts to a Buick.” Kasich, like Walker and Bush, tried to keep the focus on his record in his state. “America is a miracle country and we have to restore the sense that the miracle will apply to you,” he said. And Cruz vowed, if elected, to prosecute Planned Parenthood, cancel the Iran nuclear deal and nix Obama’s executive orders. “I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth,” he said. Trump was challenged several times on his conservative views. He previously was pro-choice, but said he’s “evolved” on the issue. Also, under questioning from moderator Megyn Kelly about past disparaging comments he made about women, Trump interrupted to say, “Only Rosie O’Donnell.” He then said, “Honestly, Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry.” The candidates squared off at the second of two kick-off debates, hosted by Fox News and Facebook in conjunction with the Ohio Republican Party. The seven other Republican hopefuls spent much of the first debate doing their best to hammer home the message that Clinton represents four more years of Obama.

"So they engineered a strategy in which case both chambers would vote to turn back the agreement.

"The House Republican leadership did a 180. Now they wouldn’t vote to reject the deal. They would vote to “approve” the deal. That would obviously fail. This strategy meant that there was no way Congress would ever ship a piece of paper to Obama to veto. In other words, if Congress votes down the very bill it intends to pass, then it has nothing to send to the White House for a veto.","3243","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/12/iran-deal-appears-complete-but-hill-republican-appear-undeterred.html"

"Conservative-minded Indian-Americans are forming a new Republican group seeking to mobilize their large and powerful community to back GOP candidates in what the founder calls “a very important time in history.”","Published September 18, 2015","3264","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"Shalabh “Shalli” Kumar, a prominent Indian-American businessman, has taken the lead in forming the Republican Hindu Coalition (RHC) in order to promote conservative principles such as free markets and limited government, with a focus on how they relate to Indian Americans. The organization is modeled after groups like the Republican Jewish Coalition, and plans to spend big in next year's elections.","3265","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"""This is a very important time in history. The country has suffered so much so dramatically in the last eight years, and another four or eight years of the same direction, the U.S. as we know it will come to an end,” Kumar told FoxNews.com.","3266","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"“We are actually giving away our economic future to China, the world is a lot less secure today than it was seven years ago, and conservatives and Republicans have to win and take the White House. This is the time when Hindu Americas should very actively get involved,” Kumar said.","3267","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"There are approximately 3.7 million Indian-Americans in the U.S. and about 50 percent of those are Hindu, according to Pew Research data. (Though the group is called the Republican Hindu Coalition, organizers say it's open to all faiths.) Kumar said that while many Hindus are ideologically conservative-leaning, they have not yet mobilized to vote for Republicans.","3268","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"“They make the highest per capita income of any income group, are highest givers to charity and among the least dependent on government. ... Yet with all these demographics cited, Hindu Americans tend to be like other minorities when it comes to voting – they are Democrats or are neutral, or they just don’t vote,” Kumar said.","3269","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"Yet the RHC is hoping to change this, and has gained the backing of some big-name Republicans, with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich agreeing to serve as honorary chairman for the group. Kumar says they have received a great deal of support from the RNC and high-ranking congressional Republicans, and are hoping to organize a congressional delegation to travel to India after they formally launch the coalition next month.","3270","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"Additionally the RHC is hoping that in light of the 2014 election of business-minded Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the U.S. and India can draw closer on a number of issues, including getting the U.S. to rely more on India for manufacturing than China.","3271","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"“Fiscal discipline, the free enterprise system, limited government, a strong national defense, and a strong posture against terrorism worldwide. These are some of the core issues and can create a strong bond between the two largest democracies on this earth,” Kumar said.","3272","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"Kumar was a Democrat until 1979 when he met then-Governor Ronald Reagan and was later part of a small business council that met with Reagan several times a year to share their views. He says his recent attendance at the Reagan Library for Wednesday’s GOP debate was an emotional moment.","3273","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"""It was a great experience, the first time I attended a presidential debate and it just so happened that I was taped meeting Donald Trump,"" he said.","3274","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"Kumar said that while the RHC is proud that Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal – whose family is from India – is running, they have not yet backed any of the candidates seeking the Republican nomination in 2016. However, Kumar has pledged to personally donate at least $2 million and raise millions more for the eventual Republican nominee, Senate and House candidates and Republican groups including the RNC.","3275","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"When asked why he is doing this now, Kumar told FoxNews.com the Obama administration policies have been so detrimental that a change is urgently needed in Washington.","3276","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"
"“We are looking more and more like India of the '70s or the '80s. In India we say 'Babu Raj' – which means the whole country gets controlled by bureaucrats,” Kumar said. “President Obama is pushing us in that direction, creating Babu Raj in the United States.”","3277","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/18/indian-americans-organize-to-boost-republicans.html"

"Add to the mix the threat of the GOP’s right wing shutting down the government over federal funding of Planned Parenthood and it’s clear we are witnessing a truly historic political moment — a party engaged in a full civil war with just a year to go before a presidential election.","3285","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"A late August Quinnipiac poll gave Republicans in Congress only a 12 percent job approval rating.","3286","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"That dismal rating would not be possible if there was any support among the Republican base for Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the party’s elected leaders on Capitol Hill.","3287","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"Republican contenders for the party’s presidential nomination have noticed. An August Gallup poll of Republicans gave Boehner only a 37 percent approval rating while 42 percent rated him negatively. The same Gallup poll showed McConnell with a disapproval rating of 41 percent among independents and Boehner with a 57 percent disapproval rating among independents. McConnell had a 34 percent favorability rating among Republicans.","3288","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"The polls reflect hard-right criticism of the leaders for failing to use their majorities to halt ObamaCare or same-sex marriage, and for failing to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood.","3289","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"“Had this dynamic unfolded anywhere in the private sector, the corporate board would have fired a CEO like John Boehner long ago,” Daniel Horowitz wrote recently in Conservative Review.","3290","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"Of course, McConnell does not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. And neither he nor Boehner had any control over the Supreme Court’s decision on gay marriage.","3291","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"But that reality did not stop Carly Fiorina, the former business executive running for president, from recently describing Boehner and McConnell as “captured by the status quo.” She is calling for the Republican majority in Congress to go beyond shutting down the government to block funding for Planned Parenthood with additional measures including banning any abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. On immigration, she argues for the construction of new and increased border security.","3292","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"

"The GOP’s top congressional leaders reasonably argue they have obstructed the Obama agenda on immigration and tried to defund Planned Parenthood. They have fought the president on increases to government spending and even appointments. Still, they find themselves punished in polls by the voters who elected them, even as Democrats blast them for a failure to compromise and a dearth of legislative solutions.","3294","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"

"Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) has become a Tea Party celebrity by virtue of his effort to remove Boehner as Speaker. Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) recently told The Washington Post that the activist base of the GOP is demanding new congressional leadership.","3296","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"“If they haven’t gotten the message that they need to change the direction of our leadership, it could be a very ugly fall for our party,” Mulvaney said. “The people who are for Donald Trump are against John Boehner and [Boehner] needs to accept that and figure out what to do about it.”","3297","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"

"Meanwhile, political outsiders with no strong policy proposals — Trump, Fiorina and retired surgeon Ben Carson — are all gaining in polls as the primary race intensifies. None of them has been elected to any political office before.","3299","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"A similar strategy has elevated a first term senator, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), by rewarding him with national media attention for rallying Tea Party activists in the House to undermine the Speaker on budget deals.","3300","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"Cruz also gained the spotlight by calling McConnell a liar over the majority leader’s handling of the votes on the future of the Export-Import Bank. Cruz calls Boehner and the rest of the GOP leadership “squishes” for trying to make deals to keep the government functioning.","3301","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"The response from the party establishment is best left to Boehner. At a Colorado fundraiser last month he told GOP donors he thinks Cruz is a “jackass.”","3302","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"
"The Speaker has also admitted to being personally hurt by being portrayed as an establishment Republican. “I tell you what pains me the most is when they describe me as ‘the establishment.’ Now, I’m the most anti-establishment Speaker we’ve ever had.”","3303","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"

"But it seems implausible that all of them would take a comparable pledge, to support the party’s top elected officials — the Republican Congressional leadership. The sheer improbability of them doing so tells us all we need to know about just how badly the GOP has splintered.","3308","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/15/why-todays-biggest-political-battle-is-war-inside-gop.html"

"If they don’t fear her becoming the Democratic nominee, why are they so literally compulsive about attacking her all the time (and even promoting Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden when they have a chance)?

"Plus, she served in the legislative branch in the U.S. Senate for eight years, was respected widely by Republicans as well as Democrats, for her legislative abilities to debate issues and find compromises. And she has had extensive foreign policy experience as Secretary of State for four years.

"How many stupid Republicans does it take to blow a slam-dunk election? Maybe just one? Kevin McCarthy takes the honor for his single-handed destruction of the Benghazi Committee’s credibility.

"Maybe 10 to 15? McCarthy gets a run for his money from members of the Freedom Caucus not willing to back Paul Ryan for Speaker. Instead, those brave souls cleave to their choice – Daniel Webster of Florida, who many mistake for the 18th century Whig orator, or possibly the well-known dictionary. Mr. Webster is running against “establishment” politicians, even though for the past 34 years he has served as an elected official in either the Florida state legislature or in Congress. He represents a wing of the GOP that is especially upset about ""crony capitalism,"" despite having received the Florida Banking Association Award, the Florida Farm Bureau Legislative Award and being named the Chamber of Commerce Legislator of the Year during his days in the Florida legislature.","3331","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/gop-needs-to-focus-on-getting-republican-president.html"
"Possibly it’s 167, the number that voted against the budget deal negotiated by exiting Speaker John Boehner – a deal that clears the deck for incoming Paul Ryan, and averts total disaster for Republicans. To be clear: while Rand Paul filibusters the deal, talking about an impending “explosion” of our deficits, the increase in spending is less than one percent. Not a big price to pay for stability, which our faltering economy sorely needs.","3332","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/gop-needs-to-focus-on-getting-republican-president.html"
"It should be remembered that in the wake of the 2013 government shut-down, polling showed that 1) Americans blamed the GOP and 2) the GOP brand fell to all-time low approval ratings. GOP gains in the 2014 election did not validate the shut-down, but rather was a referendum on the Obama White House, which was tagged for the flood of immigrant young people piling across our border, the Bergdahl scandal, the VA problems, the IRS scandal and numerous other misdeeds.","3333","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/gop-needs-to-focus-on-getting-republican-president.html"
"Maybe it takes 37; that’s the number of GOP representatives who just voted against a measure designed to allow an extension of the Export-Import Bank. The Ex-Im bank has become a favored symbol of hand-outs to corporations, excoriated by talk-show hosts who have never negotiated an export deal and have conned their listeners into thinking that the Ex-Im Bank doles out taxpayer dollars to Big Companies. The reality is that Ex-Im is that rare government agency that actually makes money, $675 million last year, for instance. The bank helps U.S. corporations big and small compete with overseas rivals that also have access to government-organized credit. While the U.S. assisted companies in arranging $12 billion in financing last year, China provided almost five times as much -- $58 billion.","3334","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/gop-needs-to-focus-on-getting-republican-president.html"
"The New York Times delighted in blaming Republicans recently for the loss of 350 jobs at a GE manufacturing plant in Wisconsin that is about to close.

"Republicans are supposed to be the party creating jobs, making it easy for companies to expand and prosper in the U.S. This current vendetta against “corporate welfare” is as costly as it is wrong-headed. The far right has joined with the far left in demonizing large corporations – the businesses that employ over half of American workers and offer considerably higher pay and benefits. Big Business certainly deserves oversight, but to zero in on job creators as opposed to the myriad other possible targets of government excess is ridiculous.","3336","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/gop-needs-to-focus-on-getting-republican-president.html"
"Meanwhile, millions of Republicans are so fed up with the status quo that they are willing to back candidates who have zero political experience. Those folks would probably not hire a piano tuner to fill their cavities or a truck driver to litigate a law suit, but somehow they think that managing the world’s biggest economy and best equipped military is child’s play. They believe that navigating our political process can be mastered overnight and that on-the-job training is okay for the biggest job in the world.

"Republicans need to understand that there is but one mission today – electing a GOP president in 2016.

"The export ban was signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1975 in response to the oil embargo by Arab OPEC nations against the U.S. for its support of Israel in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.

"Repeal backers argue the ban was passed in an era of oil scarcity, and the U.S. is now seeing an era of energy abundance that the American economy should capitalize upon. The bill calls for the removal of all restrictions on the export of crude oil, claiming this ""will provide domestic economic benefits, enhanced energy security, and flexibility in foreign diplomacy.""","3444","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/republicans-fuming-after-obama-threatens-to-veto-major-energy-bill.html"

"“Rather, Congress should be focusing its efforts on supporting our transition to a low-carbon economy.

"Cramer said that North Dakota, the epicenter of the crude oil boom, has seen a loss of thousands of jobs amid diving oil prices and growing efficiencies in oil production that squeeze workers out of the production system.

"“Lifting the 40-year old ban on exporting crude oil does nothing to help the average American family, as it would only raise gas prices while lining the pockets of wealthy polluters,” the League of Conservation Voters said. “Thankfully, President Obama is looking out for the interests of all Americans by opposing this harmful bill.

"GOP leaders promised Friday that the House will act next week -- just days from a Nov. 3 deadline.

"The debt limit fight is the latest in a long saga. For years, the party in control of Congress had to deliver many of the votes to pass debt increases, whether or not it controlled the White House.

"And the politics inside the Republican Party on the debt limit have only gotten messier.

"Only 28 House Republicans voted with virtually every Democrat last year to boost the debt ceiling; 19 of those lawmakers remain in Congress.

THE EDGE: FIORINA DEBATE SURGE IS OVER Nearly everyone experienced a net loss in this week’s scores from The Edge, but Carly Fiorina lost the most ground. Her overall tally still puts her ahead of Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, Chris Christie, and Rand Paul, but the team at New Analytics found sharp downward trend in the results. Increasingly negative media coverage since her debate performance may have started to leave its mark. The rest of the field is holding steady for now, but in varying degrees. Ben Carson and Jeb Bush hang on to their fairly high trend with less than a point lost from last week’s score. This is especially good news for Bush who has continued to falter in polling, and overall campaign performance. Also holding steady is Marco Rubio, but with a slightly higher net loss than Carson and Bush. And, while Donald Trump tops everyone for an overall score, he experienced one of the higher losses from the previous week, along with Ted Cruz. Trump and Cruz take the spots behind Fiorina in highest net losses. Remember, The Edge, a one-of-a-kind measurement from the New Analytics Company that “scrubs” television, radio, print, internet and social media to gauge positive and negative attention for the 2016 candidates. It is not a public opinion survey, but the team at New Analytics believes that The Edge provides a way to show changes in the race before polls can reflect them. The data are compiled into a single score and provided exclusively to Fox News First. Here’s this week’s final scores with gains/losses from last week in brackets: Donald Trump, 25.04 [-1.01]; Ben Carson, 13.14 [-0.82]; Jeb Bush, 10.15 [-0.95]; Marco Rubio, 7.57 [-0.98]; Carly Fiorina, 5.46 [-2.78]; Ted Cruz, 6.71 [-1.26]; Mike Huckabee, 4.83 [-0.68]; John Kasich, 3.90 [+0.11]; Rand Paul, 3.80 [-0.79]; Chris Christie, 3.86 [-0.54] And Dems too - And ahead of next week’s debate, New Analytics scored the Democrats for the first time. Hillary Clinton had an overwhelmingly higher score, as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders came within a few points of each other. Here are their overall scores: Hillary Clinton [42.67]; Joe Biden [22.19]; Bernie Sanders [21.95]; Martin O'Malley [8.93]; Jim Webb [3.84] Cruz tops Rubio in fundraising, both fall short to Carson - WSJ: “Texas Sen. Ted Cruz raised $12.2 million in the third quarter, pushing him into the upper ranks of Republican presidential hopefuls who have announced details of their fundraising hauls so far. Mr. Cruz’s quarterly take nearly matched his second-quarter number and brings his total raised this year to more than $26 million. It also spotlights his fundraising prowess, as he raised about twice as much cash in the period as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio…Aides to Mr. Rubio announced at a donor retreat in Las Vegas that he had raised $6 million in the quarter, according to a person present. The receipts bring Mr. Rubio’s total haul to $18 million for the campaign, and he has about $11 million in the bank. Both men trail Ben Carson, who raised $20 million in the latest period and leads the GOP pack of candidates who have disclosed their figures.” Cruz goes negative on Trump for the first time - In an interview with WABC, Sen. Ted Cruz said he doesn’t think Donald Trump will be the nominee. Cruz said, “I don’t believe Donald is going to be the nominee and I think, in time, the lion’s share of his supporters end up with us.” Trump says Bergdahl should have been ‘executed’ - AP: “Republican presidential front-runnerDonald Trump said Thursday that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl should have been executed for leaving his post in Afghanistan. ‘We’re tired of Sgt.

Jeb Bushcame out against reauthorizing parts of the Voting Rights Act that were thrown out by the Supreme Court in 2013, suggesting he would resist bipartisan calls to reinstate a key component of the law if he became president. In an interview with TIME Thursday, Bush said that states like Georgia no longer need to be covered by the now-defunct pre-clearance provisions, while controversial moves such as Alabama’s recent closure of motor vehicle offices are covered by the provisions that remain intact.” Carson: armed Jews would have ‘greatly diminished’ Hilter’s murders - WaPo: “Ben Carson said Thursday that Adolf Hitler’s mass murder of Jews ‘would have been greatly diminished’ if German citizens had not been disarmed by the Nazi regime. The comment, which came during an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, was similar to arguments Carson made following last week’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., in which he defended the Second Amendment and suggested that the victims should have fought the gunman.” [Watch Fox: Chief Political Correspondent Campaign Carl Cameron reports from Nashua, New Hampshire] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… The Atlantic brings us a short film of luthier, Alex Bishop, who shows the beauty of crafting wood into complicated musical instruments.

Mrs. Clinton broke with President Barack Obama this week over a major Pacific free-trade deal many Democrats oppose, just as the White House begins selling the accord to Congress. That decision followed harsh comments from the former secretary of state about Mr. Obama’s handling of immigration, a rebuke of his Syria policy and her call for repealing a key piece of his health-care law.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) plans to announce his opposition Friday to President Obama’s nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration, citing questions about Dr. Robert M.

"And so Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., armed with what he can find, pitched his members at the weekly GOP luncheon Tuesday on the use of the special parliamentary gambit to undo some portions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and strike federal dollars for Planned Parenthood. The reconciliation strategy is still valuable because it can sidestep filibusters and curb amendment options for senators – the two most fundamental tenets of Senate operations.","3717","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/12/republicans-float-controversial-tactic-in-next-round-obamacare-repeal-fight.html"
"Budget reconciliation appeals to Senate Republicans because they’ve yet to conduct an actual, concrete vote on repealing the ACA. Democrats held the Senate majority since final passage of ObamaCare in 2010. As a result, they could block such a vote from coming to the floor. Moreover, Democrats continue to barricade the Senate from voting on an ObamaCare repeal – even though Democrats now operate in the minority. That’s because of filibusters. It takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster – usually at two distinct parliamentary mileposts. Republicans now control 54 seats in the Senate. So the math to hinder an ObamaCare repeal still favors the Democrats.","3718","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/12/republicans-float-controversial-tactic-in-next-round-obamacare-repeal-fight.html"
"But that’s the beauty of budget reconciliation. If the House and Senate approve a budget each year, lawmakers get one shot at crafting a reconciliation package and install various legislative priorities which have trouble vaulting the 60 vote threshold. Time is limited for debate under reconciliation. And most importantly, it only takes a simple majority (presumably 51 ayes) to approve the reconciliation measure.","3719","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/12/republicans-float-controversial-tactic-in-next-round-obamacare-repeal-fight.html"

"The real power of budget reconciliation lies in the Senate. But Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution dictates that “revenue” related matters must originate in the House of Representatives.

And so he shocked everyone when he emerged and announced his withdrawal as a candidate.","Published October 13, 2015","3796","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/13/my-fellow-republicans-its-time-to-seize-initiative.html"
"The website The Hill reported that Rep. Tom Rice (R-S.C.) and Rep.

"Some conservative members reportedly accused Boehner of displaying the characteristics of a dictator in a banana republic. Among them was Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who told me in a telephone interview of the deep frustration conservative Republicans feel about their leadership, which, he says, has stymied their attempt to reduce spending and reform government.","3798","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/13/my-fellow-republicans-its-time-to-seize-initiative.html"

"Jordan says that gives Boehner dictatorial power over any bill or amendment he doesn't want to bring to a vote. Jordan and his conservative colleagues want to change the system so every member has a chance to introduce bills and to get amendments considered, debated and voted on.

"According to Jordan, leadership is afraid to entertain any bills it doesn't believe will pass the Senate, much less get to the president's desk.

"Jordan says he would have demanded that Planned Parenthood stop receiving federal funds on the first day undercover videos were released that allegedly depicted employees discussing the sale of fetal body parts in ways to maximize profits.

"The way to restore ""order,"" the way to change the system and make it more democratic and fair, is to elect more members who hate the current system and vow to bend it to the will of voters. This will require Republicans to seize the initiative and explain to voters who don't pay enough attention that the current leadership in both parties is mortgaging the future with higher taxes, astronomical debt and possible bankruptcy.","3805","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/13/my-fellow-republicans-its-time-to-seize-initiative.html"
"Jordan's candidate for speaker is Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), ""but we will talk to others,"" Jordan said. Those others presumably include Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has repeatedly said he doesn't want the job but reportedly will be discussing it with his family over the 10-day congressional recess.

"South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy’s Special Committee on Benghazi has been now thoroughly outed — not by Democrats but by his fellow Republicans.","3904","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"First House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) bragged that Gowdy’s committee had succeeded in bringing down Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers in her bid for the White House. Then New York House Republican Richard Hanna confirmed the same partisan purpose of Gowdy’s committee: “This may not be politically correct,” he said during a radio interview last week, “but I think there is a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after people and get an individual, Hillary Clinton.","3905","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Gowdy, however, continues to deny the undeniable. He insists that he and his fellow Republicans on the committee — Reps. Susan Brooks (Ind.), Jim Jordan (Ohio), Mike Pompeo (Kan.), Martha Roby, (Ala.) Peter Roskham (Ill.) and Lynn Westmoreland (Ga.) — are focused only on the facts about the 2012 attack and why and how to avoid such a tragedy in the future, and that they have no anti-Clinton political agenda.","3906","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"So let’s see if Gowdy and his fellow Republican colleagues walk the walk, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Let’s see how many questions they ask the former secretary of State in this week’s hearings about what happened, why and how to avoid such future tragedies — and how many of them ask about emails and private servers.","3907","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"To test their attempt to rehabilitate themselves for their past conduct that obviously attempted to exploit a tragedy involving the deaths of four Americans for partisan purposes, let’s see if Gowdy or any of the Republicans on the panel ask the following three questions.","3908","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"1. Secretary Clinton, can you tell us why you appointed the Accountability Review Board, chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering and Adm. Michael Mullen, to investigate the Benghazi tragedy and what was the result of their work?","3909","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Of course, if they ask Clinton this question, they will learn that she gave the board, led by a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Republican President George H.W. Bush and a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, complete independence and access. She committed ahead of time, unlike any prior secretaries before her, to full transparency. And when she published the full report (except for some classified material), she immediately accepted all the board’s recommendations to correct “systemic failures” of the department prior to and during the tragedy, and took responsibility.","3910","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"2. Secretary Clinton, as you know, seven other congressional committees have investigated the Benghazi attack. Is there anything they missed that we should be looking into?","3911","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Of course, if Gowdy and the Republican members ask this question, they will have to try to explain why their committee exists at all (other than the anti-Clinton reason that everyone knows) unless they are willing to criticize other Republican Benghazi committees for not doing an adequate job, such as the Republican-controlled House Armed Services and Intelligence committees, which published extensive reports and findings about Benghazi.","3912","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"3. Secretary Clinton, did your choice to use a single BlackBerry to send out emails during your tenure as secretary of State rather than two, or your decision to store emails on a private server at your home, have any impact whatsoever on the tragic events of what happened at Benghazi and its aftermath?","3913","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Of course, the truthful — and indisputable — answer to this question is: No. Gowdy and his fellow Republicans know this.","3914","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Every single member who asks any question about emails — Gowdy, Brooks, Jordan, Pompeo, Roby, Roskham and Westmoreland — should be asked by the media and all constituents back home who care about wasteful government spending: How can you justify spending almost $5 million of taxpayer money when you have uncovered nothing new, duplicated spending by fellow Republicans, and have spent so much time on a subject having nothing to do with the tragedy at Benghazi?","3915","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Let’s see if any of these Republicans ask any of the above three questions or acknowledge that they have wasted taxpayer dollars in trying to hurt Hillary Clinton politically rather than trying to save American lives who serve at dangerous embassy locations in the future.","3916","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"

"The Republican candidates and observers complained the questions were demeaning, silly, and designed to provoke confrontation rather than genuine policy discussion. Others took aim at the debate format, and wondered about the moderators’ professionalism.","4000","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html"
"On several sites aggregating Twitter reaction, the moderators were declared the losers, “hands down.”","4001","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html"
"The Washington Post declared it “CNBC’s really bad debate night.”","4002","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html"
"“The moderators had a worse night than the New York Mets … this was a trainwreck,” Fox News' Howard Kurtz charged Thursday, referring to Game 2 of the World Series, and calling the debate questions “condescending, snide, hostile and borderline insulting.”","4003","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html"
"While it might not have hurt CNBC during the broadcast -- the network touted 14 million viewers the following day, a network record -- it got a drubbing from candidates and party leaders during and after the prime-time event.","4004","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html"
"""While I was proud of our candidates and the way they handled tonight’s debate, the performance by the CNBC moderators was extremely disappointing and did a disservice to their network, our candidates, and voters,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, calling the questioning “deeply unfortunate.”","4005","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html"

"The criticism took off after Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was asked whether his opposition to raising the debt ceiling indicates he may not be the “the kind of problem-solver American voters want.” Cruz unloaded on the moderators, blasting them for asking questions like, “Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain? Ben Carson, can you do math? John Kasich, will you insult two people over here? Marco Rubio, why don’t you resign? Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?” After the cheers for Cruz died down he suggested the moderators were Democrats.","4009","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html"
"“Nobody watching at home believes that any of the moderators has any intention of voting in a Republican primary,” he charged. Cruz used the debate to send out a fundraising letter to supporters afterward, “declaring war on the liberal media,” and went on to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars overnight. As for the focus groups following the debate, the candidates who took on the media and the moderators directly -- namely Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- seemed to benefit the most.","4010","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html"
"“It was brutal takedown, and CNBC’s smarmy moderators had it coming. Cruz is far from the first conservative to rail against liberal media bias, but he did it about as effectively as it can be done in 30 seconds,” said the Boston Globe’s Jeff Jacoby. “The clip of that moment will go viral.”","4011","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnbc-moderators-debate-performance.html"

"Well, if CNBC got an F then Fox Business News gets an A. The winners of Tuesday night's GOP debate in Milwaukee were the audience and the Republican party. This wasn't just a debate. It was a tutorial on growth, taxes, health care, trade, regulation, and the Fed. Six random takeaways: 1. Every candidate argued for lower tax rates and closing loopholes and simplification. What a contrast with the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Rubio was the outlier. He argued for a tax credit as a way to help families. ‎He calls this a pro-family tax cut, but it doesn't help the economy. Rand Paul zinged him with the argument that his refundable credit is a $1 trillion entitlement program. 2. Sparks flew the most on issues of foreign policy, immigration, and trade. Trump got smacked down on immigration when he called for a deportation of 11 million people. Bush, Kasich, Rubio, and Fiorina were for an aggressive, interventionist foreign policy with more military spending. Trump and Paul argued for a hands off policy.","Published November 11, 2015","4195","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/11/six-takeways-from-great-milwaukee-gop-debate.html"
"Conservatives have to decide whether America should be the world's policeman. 3. Republicans muffed the issue of bank bailouts. Bush, Kasich and Cruz all seemed to endorse taxpayer bailouts if we have another financial crisis. This is a big problem for the GOP. Why is it so hard to say: If I am president I will never bail-out a private company. 4. Trump is still the celebrity rock star candidate and had throngs of fans following him everywhere he went. 5. All the candidates need to smile more and start to use humor more when they speak (like Reagan) rather than standing on stage looking like androids. 6. One other observation that TV audiences couldn't see: Bush and Rubio were standing next to each other but these old friends hardly exchanged a word and turned their back on each other during the breaks. They are adversaries now. You can expect the nuclear ad wars to begin. Here are some brief comments on each candidate’s performance Tuesday night: Trump. His first answer was a huge downer: He said that ""wages are too high""‎ and that that costs jobs. Yikes! We can't have a GOP that is for LOWER wages. He argued against the free trade deal with Asia. His best line: Every Republican has a tax plan better than Hillary's. Carson. His best line was that the media accuses him of lying but it was Hillary who told her family one thing about the Bengazi attack and the public another. What about that lie? He still rambles too much and had a bad night. Rubio. The Florida senator had the best line of the night: ""Welders make more money than philosophers."" He argued for raising wages through growth. ‎ He sounded a little wonkish, but had no gaffes. He also had the biggest cheers from the crowd.","4196","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/11/six-takeways-from-great-milwaukee-gop-debate.html"
"Kasich. ‎He referred to tax cuts as tax schemes. He defended bailouts. He got booed. His best line was balance the budget by cutting taxes. Cruz. The Texas senator gave a spirited defense of his tax cut plan. He argued that immigrants are driving down wages (sic). He argued for taking away power from the Federal Reserve. He needs to stop grimacing when he talks. Bush. The former Florida governor gave his strongest performance yet. He endorsed repealing every Obama rule. He defended his brother's actions in Iraq. Best line: when Trump talks about deportation there are high fives in the Clinton campaign.","4197","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/11/six-takeways-from-great-milwaukee-gop-debate.html"
"Fiorina. She argued for zero-based budgeting. The former CEO said that immigrants helped build Silicon Valley. And she made a passionate case for the free market in health care as ""a cancer survivor."" Paul. The Kentucky senator was the one candidate who talked about how to cut spending and shrink the government. Had a great line when he was asked if Hillary is right that the economy does better under Democrats: ""Inequality is worst wherever Democrats are in charge,” he said. If you want more economic growth move to “a state with a Republican governor and city with a Republican mayor."" On the under card: Santorum’s best line: ""Family break up is the biggest cause of poverty."" Marriage is the best economic stimulus. Downer of the night: Santorum says ""I'm the only candidate who supports the export import bank."" Thank God. Huckabee. He stressed the national sales tax/fair tax. Let every worker keep their whole paycheck and ""my plan is the only tax reform that doesn't just reduce the IRS, I shut it down."" Christie. The New Jersey took it to Hillary and was relentless. It was the old tough as nails Christie we all fell in love with six years ago. His best line ""I won't just debate Hillary, I will prosecute her."" Also, he gave a great defense of the police against the hoodlums. Jindal. His strategy was to tear down Huckabee and Christie (for not cutting enough government spending). The attacks seemed to backfire. Best performers of the night in order: ‎Christie, Fiorina, Paul, Bush and Rubio.","4198","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/11/six-takeways-from-great-milwaukee-gop-debate.html"

"As head of the committee, the Wisconsin Republican was able to shepherd through major legislation, setting the terms for Congress' approval of the Pacific-nation trade deal negotiated by the president, in addition to reforms to Medicare and other important measures.

"The 2-1 decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans further dims the prospect of implementation of the executive action before Obama leaves office in 2017.

"Republicans had criticized the plan as an illegal executive overreach when Obama announced it last November. Twenty-six states challenged the plan in court.

"The Justice Department said in a statement that it disagreed with the court's ruling, claiming that Obama's action would ""allow DHS to bring greater accountability to our immigration system by prioritizing the removal of the worst offenders, not people who have long ties to the United States and who are raising American children.""

"Ryan usually makes these treks alone. But this time, he made the journey protected by three U.S. Capitol Police officers and pursued by a horde of reporters and photographers. Perhaps mindful that it might not look speaker-esque, he ditched the earphones for this walk.","4228","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Ryan couldn’t have tapped a more appropriate Zeppelin tune than “When the Levy Breaks” -- his personal breakwater against pursuing the speakership having finally cracked due to a barrage of entreaties from Republican colleagues.","4229","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"

"The least-reported story in America now is perhaps the government’s collision course with a Nov. 3 deadline to hike the federal debt ceiling. The debt limit is the maximum balance the federal government can carry at any one time, currently around $18.1 trillion.","4232","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"

"Most calisthenics that summer focused on negotiations between President Obama and Boehner to simultaneously raise the debt ceiling and forge a so-called “grand bargain” to slash spending and alter the government’s cataclysmic fiscal trajectory.","4234","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"

"Many were focused on a decision late Wednesday night by the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus to “support” Ryan for speaker.","4237","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"That meant Ryan had likely marshaled the necessary votes to win the speakership.

"At 9:01 am Thursday, Treasury took the extreme step of postponing a scheduled Nov. 2 auction of two-year federal notes -- the day before the government will slam into the debt limit.","4239","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Such auction cancellations are rare. Selling off Treasury notes incurs additional federal debt. The signal of shelving an auction means Treasury doesn’t want to incur any more debt, lacking confidence in Congress to increase the spending ceiling, allowing for the accumulation of additional debt.","4240","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"“The current debt limit impasse is also now adversely affecting the operation of government financing, increasing federal government borrowing costs, reducing the Treasury bill supply, and increasing the operational risk associated with holding a lower cash balance,” said Treasury in the statement.","4241","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"It added that as of Nov. 3, federal coffers would dwindle to a meager $30 billion. That may seem like a lot. But to the federal government, $30 billion is practically pocket lint.","4242","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"What’s remarkable is that there simply doesn’t seem to be a route right now in the House and Senate to raise the debt ceiling. Raising the debt limit is the most noxious vote a member of Congress can take. Right now, the sheer dearth of information from senior lawmakers and top legislative aides is startling. No one has any clue how this gets solved.","4243","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"“It’s pretty drastic,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., when asked about Treasury’s move to cancel the auction.","4244","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"

"“We’ll see,” was Boehner’s practically bromidic response when asked by reporters what course the House may take to avoid hitting the debt ceiling.","4246","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"In his weekly colloquy on the floor with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., only indicated that “the House is expected to address this issue next week.”","4247","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"McCarthy added Congress “must start the down payment where we don’t have to worry about raising the debt limit and paying off the debt and not leaving it to our children and grandchildren.”","4248","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"In a meeting with reporters, Hoyer assured Democratic unanimity on a so-called “clean” measure to raise the debt ceiling with no political add-ons. But even that gambit faces trouble. The House is now comprised of 247 Republicans and 188 Democrats. The magic number for passing most bills is 218. If Democrats stick together, that means Republicans still need to cough up 30 yeas to lug a measure to passage.","4249","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"That sounds relatively easy. But isn’t. Past is prologue.","4250","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"The House last dealt with the debt limit on February 11, 2014. The chamber voted that day to “suspend” the debt ceiling, 221-201. But the breakdown of that roll call tally is packed with intrigue -- 193 Democrats voted aye to pass the bill, buttressed by a mere 28 Republicans. And 199 Republicans voted no.","4251","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"The 28 GOP yeas were mostly members of the leadership team, committee chairs (a couple of whom have since retired) and moderates. That vote is a landmark: the fewest number of members from the majority party who voted yes on a major bill which passed the House in years.","4252","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Among the 199 noes? Paul Ryan.","4253","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"It’s not hard to understand Ryan’s no vote that day. The bill simply put off a rendezvous with the debt ceiling until this fall without any complimentary action to reduce spending or entitlement obligations like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- the biggest drivers of federal red ink.","4254","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"But what would Ryan’s presumably nascent speakership look like if he were to cast a nay ballot on a similar debt ceiling bill in the coming days? And as speaker, would Ryan be willing to put a bill like that on the House floor?","4255","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Such a challenge is vexing for Ryan. Solving fiscal issues is supposed to be his calling card. A supposed economic shaman, Ryan propelled himself to this point by talking about taxes, spending and budgets. And with the timing of the debt ceiling and the speaker vote slated for Oct. 29, either Boehner’s going to figure this out or it’s going to fall in Ryan’s lap.","4256","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"In an interview with CBS, Boehner promised he wouldn’t “leave my successor a dirty barn.” But the place is a sty right now. A surefire course to short-circuiting a Ryan speakership is for Boehner to leave without lifting the debt limit. That could be detrimental to Ryan as either the standoff lingers or the Wisconsin Republican is forced to put a politically untenable bill on the floor which goes against every fiber of his political being -- relying on Democrats to advance the cause.","4257","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"That move is directly out of Boehner’s playbook and will infuriate conservatives. In the vernacular of Led Zeppelin, “The Song Remains the Same.” It won’t look good for the new speaker.","4258","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"One knowledgeable source suggested to Fox News that if the debt ceiling issue isn’t resolved by Thursday, the House could delay the speaker vote so as not to undercut Ryan. Senior congressional sources contend that plan wasn’t in play right now. But remember that House Republicans have already burned through at least four different plans to elect a new speaker since Boehner announced his resignation.","4259","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Ryan arrives at this point with tenuous political capital. If he’s elected speaker, he’s going to need détente with the hard-right. A debt ceiling scrum on either side of the speaker vote could chew up some of the good will Ryan’s negotiated with his fellow Republicans.","4260","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Democrats are already angling for Ryan, too. On Tuesday night, he laid down a non-negotiable for him to become speaker:","4261","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"“I cannot and will not give up my family time,” Ryan said.","4262","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Later, he declared “I'm here four days a week. I'm not going to spend the other three days running around America.”","4263","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Freedom Caucus member Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, decried Ryan’s condition for serving.","4264","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"“He says, ‘I don’t want to work weekends.’ I’ve never heard of someone who wanted more power and less responsibility,” protested Huelskamp, who still supports Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., for speaker.","4265","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Without intending to do so, Ryan may have already stumbled into a political trap laid artfully this week by Pelosi. She applauded Ryan’s “respect for his family-work balance.”","4266","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"“I think that’s very exciting because that’s what we want for all of America’s families,” gushed the California Republican.","4267","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"She then ticked off a laundry list of Democratic policy priorities, including family medical leave, health care for seniors and tax policy.","4268","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"“I hope that that respect for (Ryan’s) situation would translate for recognition of what that means to all of America’s families because when America’s families succeed, America succeeds,” Pelosi said.","4269","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"Pelosi is watching to see what policies emanate from the speaker’s office under Ryan. She’ll lower the boom on him if she doesn’t think his approaches are pro-family enough if he continues to trumpet the importance of trotting home to Wisconsin each weekend.","4270","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"
"And that begs this question: Let’s say Congress runs head-long into the debt ceiling in a few days. Will Ryan stay in Washington and hash this out?","4271","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/song-remains-same-for-ryan-republican-house.html"

"Just over half of American voters support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s suggestion to deport the millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally. Some 52 percent favor deporting illegal immigrants back to their home countries, while 40 percent are opposed, according to the latest Fox News national poll. Republicans like the idea by a much wider 46-point margin (70-24 percent), while Democrats oppose it by a 24-point margin (58-34 percent).","Published November 25, 2015","4324","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/25/fox-news-poll-trumps-deportation-plan-smart-silly-or-wrong.html"
"CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL FOX NEWS POLL RESULTS The poll asks a follow-up question to further breakdown how voters feel about “identifying and deporting millions of immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally.” The largest number -- 41 percent -- thinks it’s a “smart idea” that should be “seriously considered.” Another 30 percent say it’s “just silly because it would be impossible to carry out,” while 24 percent of voters say the idea is “wrong and shouldn’t be done even if it were possible.” Most Republicans, 60 percent, call it a smart idea, while 25 percent dismiss it as silly. Just 10 percent think it’s wrong. Trump also talks about building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. There are mixed views on that: 50 percent of voters favor it, while 47 percent are opposed. That’s little changed from when the question was last asked on Fox News polls in both 2010 and 2006. Here again, though, Republicans favor building a wall by a large 71-26 percent margin. That’s a 45-point difference. Meanwhile Democrats oppose it by 42 points (69-27 percent). Independents are somewhat more likely to support deporting all (+11 points) and building a wall (+8 points). Despite majorities backing a wall and deportation, the plan that gets the most support is letting immigrants who are working in the U.S. illegally to apply for legal status: 68 percent of voters favor vs. 28 percent oppose. Majorities of Democrats (76 percent), independents (67 percent) and Republicans (63 percent) favor this option. Democratic pollster Chris Anderson says that the results illustrate how people can support seemingly contradictory plans on the complex issue of immigration. For example, 51 percent of voters who think Trump’s deportation plan is a “smart idea,” also favor giving illegal immigrants with jobs in the U.S. the chance to apply for legal status. “The GOP primary is clearly driving the immigration debate,” adds Anderson, who conducts the Fox News poll with Republican pollster Daron Shaw. “Republicans overwhelmingly support deportation and a wall, so that’s what Republican candidates are talking about, even though the plan that generates the broadest agreement is to allow those working here to apply for legal status.” Overall, fewer than one in ten says immigration is the most important problem facing the country today. In the wake of the Paris attacks, terrorism (24 percent) now tops the economy (21 percent) as the priority. There’s a substantial gap before foreign policy (7 percent), health care (7 percent), immigration (7 percent) and the deficit (5 percent) are mentioned. The Fox News poll is based on live telephone interviews (landline and cellphone) with 1,016 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from Nov. 16-19, 2015. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.","4325","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/25/fox-news-poll-trumps-deportation-plan-smart-silly-or-wrong.html"

The hope by Republican leaders is that separate votes will extract the Planned Parenthood issue from the massive federal spending fight. Republican leaders believe the strategy achieves two goals.

"In the mid-1970s, Congress created the formal budget process, and it addressed a basic hurdle in the Senate: the chamber's unlimited opportunities for debate and amendments.

"Could it be used here? Of course, politics is the art of the possible. It's one thing to roll out reconciliation for standard-issue budgets. But it's a high parliamentary art form to use reconciliation for other controversial policy goals. There is an inherent landmine that comes with reconciliation. It's called the ""Byrd Rule,"" which holds that ""extraneous"" legislative priorities can't fall under reconciliation. It takes 60 votes to waive the Budget Act and overcome the Byrd Rule.","4457","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/17/gop-leaders-scramble-to-address-planned-parenthood-outcry-without-shutdown.html"

"But the right would be apoplectic. That would undoubtedly trigger a challenge to Boehner for his speakership.

"McCarthy's decision, announced moments before Republicans were set to nominate their candidate, will postpone the vote for speaker. McCarthy had been running against Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Fla., before he dropped out, and it's unclear whether other candidates will now step forward.","4647","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/high-drama-on-capitol-hill-republicans-square-off-in-speaker-vote.html"
"While McCarthy, R-Calif., faced vocal opposition from some conservative members and groups, he was thought to have more than enough support to win the party's nomination in the vote initially set for Thursday.

"Practically speaking, Republicans' overriding interest is to find a candidate who can muster an absolute majority on the House floor in a full chamber vote, originally set for Oct. 29.

"Conservative groups, meanwhile, cheered the decision.

"Shortly after announcing his candidacy, McCarthy was seen to stumble in a Fox News interview where he appeared to link Hillary Clinton's dropping poll numbers to the congressional Benghazi committee.

"Republicans have nearly 250 members in the House and on paper have the numbers to win against the Democrats' nominee, likely Nancy Pelosi.

"It was really amazing. The question had to be asked. Just last week, Donald Trump said of Carly Fiorina, “Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?”","Published September 16, 2015","4773","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/16/carly-fiorina-turns-tables-on-trump-and-shines-at-second-republican-debate.html"
"The debate moderator had to ask about it. But in doing so, they first let Donald Trump attack Jeb Bush.Bush had said he would cut money for women’s health care. Bush then said he misspoke. Donald Trump made Bush own it. He hammered Bush whose response was flat footed. He refused to concede that Bush misspoke.","4774","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/16/carly-fiorina-turns-tables-on-trump-and-shines-at-second-republican-debate.html"
"Carly Fiorina turned the tables on Trump. She said millions of American women knew what Donald Trump meant. It forced Trump, perhaps for the first time, to walk back his remark and declare that Fiorina had a lovely face. Fiorina was the only person on the stage that Trump seemed fearful of.","4775","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/16/carly-fiorina-turns-tables-on-trump-and-shines-at-second-republican-debate.html"
"Toward the end of the debate, Fiorina recounted the death of her child due to drug addiction. She connected with the audience. Earlier, she clearly became emotional talking about the Planned Parenthood videos, challenging Democrats to watch them.","4776","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/16/carly-fiorina-turns-tables-on-trump-and-shines-at-second-republican-debate.html"
"Donald Trump could not play off the crowd’s energy on Wednesday night. The crowd was very subdued. They also were not, for the most part, his fans going into the debate. It worked against Trump. He repeatedly tried to land blows and with only a handful of exceptions, they fell flat. Trying to accuse George W. Bush of making the nation less safe also hurt him and it gave Chris Christie a way to use his resume.","4777","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/16/carly-fiorina-turns-tables-on-trump-and-shines-at-second-republican-debate.html"
"But time and time again, Carly Fiorina showed she could hold up against the rest. It was a very real introduction to the nation as a legitimate contender. She showed herself strong on defense; she had a command of the issues; and she was willing to take the fight to Hillary Clinton. “It was an activity, not an accomplishment,” she said of Hillary flying on airplanes. It was a strong blow by a candidate most people had never seen.","4778","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/16/carly-fiorina-turns-tables-on-trump-and-shines-at-second-republican-debate.html"
"The big question now is not whether Carly Fiorina’s polling goes up, but from whom does she take votes? My guess is, among others, Ben Carson, who does great as a lecturer, but not as a debater. He was very soft spoken and not very engaged.","4779","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/16/carly-fiorina-turns-tables-on-trump-and-shines-at-second-republican-debate.html"

"Here’s one way to look at this week's Republican presidential debates, to be aired live Tuesday night from Milwaukee on the Fox Business Network:","Published November 09, 2015","4783","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"The debates may offer less. They may also offer more.","4784","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"How so?","4785","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"The FBN debate at 9 pm ET, co-hosted by the Wall Street Journal, features the fewest candidates so far on a prime time stage – eight, down from ten in last month’s now-infamous CNBC debate.","4786","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"We don't know what the viewing audience for this debate will be, as Fox Business reaches about 11 million fewer homes than CNBC (with 24 million viewers, the first GOP debate was the highest-rated broadcast in the history of the Fox News Channel, just as CNN and CNBC had record-setting evenings).","4787","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"But here's where this debate may one-up its predecessors: by pulling off an adult conversation. In that regard, think of Milwaukee as a Boulder mulligan – a sober do-over on taxes, commerce and government that CNBC promised but failed to deliver.","4788","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"Here are three angles worth noting, if you plan to keep a scorecard on Tuesday night:","4789","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"1. The Maturity Test","4790","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"To the adage that “saints have no moderation”… can moderators be saintly? Given the outcry over CNBC’s line of questioning, let’s see if FBN’s team can stick to the script and keep the conversation along economic themes as advertised.","4791","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"The three previous three GOP debates left many of the candidates unhappy with the choice of questions. For Republicans, will the fourth time be the charm?","4792","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"There’ll be a temptation to go off-subject: Ben Carson’s alleged biographical inconsistencies; Donald Trump’s “Saturday Night Live” gig; yet another Jeb Bush rebranding. But if the post-debate analysis centers on the substance of what the candidates said, not on how various people misbehaved, then the “littlest” debate may be the one that achieves the highest stature.","4793","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"2. The Obama/Hillary Factor","4794","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"It was two Democrats who had a good night the last time the Republican hopefuls gathered: President Obama and Hillary Clinton. That’s because the candidate-moderator sparring took the focus away from economic angst – a sentiment key to the GOP strategy for retaking the White House next year.","4795","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"Last week, the federal government reported that 271,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy in October; and unemployment fell to a seven-year low of 5 percent. As for the electorate feeling it, it’s a Prozac nation. Per this USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released over the weekend, 70 percent of respondents think the country is on the wrong track.","4796","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"The eight GOP debaters need to explain why.","4797","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"One line of attack for them to consider: Mrs. Clinton’s promise to “rein in the excess of capitalism”. Aside from the obvious hypocrisy (capitalism ain’t so bad when you and your spouse are paid $25 million for giving a little over 100 speeches), it’s an opening for the GOP to rebrand itself as the party of growth and opportunity.","4798","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"Put another way: in order to win a first term, the Republican nominee needs to shape the race as a third Obama term – and warn voters to expect a Clintonian diet of higher taxes, more regulation and less trust in entrepreneurs.","4799","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"3. The Separation Factor","4800","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"We have GOP presidential candidates trying to corner the market on brashness (Trump, Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie). Still others strive to be non-conformists – Carson, with no political experience; Marco Rubio, at age 44, a generation younger than the typical Republican nominee in the Reagan-Romney era.","4801","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"However, no Republican contender claims the mantle of “the jobs candidate.” Maybe that changes Tuesday night in Milwaukee.","4802","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"Rubio and Bush have traditional tax-cut plans – what one might expect of campaigns flush with big-brained economists. Cruz, Carson and Rand Paul all favor a flat tax, whose DNA can be traced back 20 years to Steve Forbes’ presidential campaign.","4803","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"But is that the same as selling America on a vision of kicking the economy into a higher gear? Yes, some economic conditions differ from 2012 – most notably, unemployment. Then again, with a labor-participation rate sitting at a four-decade low, the economy should be a target-rich environment for the party out of power.","4804","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"It’s worth noting that we’re within 11 weeks of the first vote in Iowa and the presidential race lacks a candidate tapping into economic uncertainty in a signature manner. Various contenders play around the edges – balancing the federal budget, revamping Social Security, easing the middle-class squeeze – but the hunt’s on for the one Republican who can distill the angst into something as simple as “are you better off today than you were four years ago?”","4805","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
"Solve that riddle and one of the Republicans on the stage in Milwaukee has a good shot at winning the night – and the bigger prize less than a year from now.","4806","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/09/fbn-debate-gop-candidate-who-nails-economic-message-will-grab-spotlight.html"
