"A. I spend probably about 80 percent of my time on Kushner Companies, and the other 20 percent on different companies I’m involved with or different projects I work on. I always try to focus on what needs the most attention. The good thing about being involved in a lot of things is that my experiences in all the various businesses inform my perspectives and views on all the other ones.","6","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/realestate/commercial/a-conversation-with-jared-c-kushner.html?_r=0"

"A. That portfolio is part of a strategic initiative. We’ve been very active in buying apartment buildings in New York City. Our portfolio is now around 100 residential buildings, and hopefully growing. By having scale in that business, it has enabled us to really build a great infrastructure to offer great service and superior product to the tenant base.","12","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/realestate/commercial/a-conversation-with-jared-c-kushner.html?_r=0"

"A. Developers complain that it’s hard finding property these days, but it’s always hard to find deals. I think you just have to work a little bit harder and be creative. New York is such a dynamic market that as the market evolves and the living patterns change, you just have to be very in tune with them so that you can try to create the supply that’s meeting the changing demand. We’ve done over $5 billion of acquisitions over the last four and a half, five years.","20","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/realestate/commercial/a-conversation-with-jared-c-kushner.html?_r=0"

"After decades of debate, false starts and cost overruns, luxury golf finally arrived in the Bronx on Wednesday, as the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point opened in the shadow of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.","APRIL 1, 2015","47","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"Forty years ago, as swaths of the South Bronx blazed, such a news bulletin might have been an April Fool’s joke. But while the public links made its debut on April 1, the 18-hole course marked a milestone for urban fans of golf and the end of a long struggle for the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation.","48","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"The parks department already oversees more than a dozen other municipal golf courses, including four in the Bronx. But the new golf course in Ferry Point Park, in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx, the first built in the city since 1964, represents a departure, elevating municipal golf to a new level of sophistication — and expense.","49","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"Greens fees are about three times what they are at the city’s other courses; a city resident will pay $169 to play on weekends, while a nonresident will pay $215. Electric golf carts are outfitted with GPS, allowing golfers, among other things, to order a chicken sandwich and a Bronx Pale Ale while they are playing.","50","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"Perhaps paradoxically for such a high-end experience, the 7,400-yard golf course, which received a push forward when the company led by Donald J. Trump won the bid to run it, is built on a former landfill that closed in 1963. Scores of vents jut up from the links to release methane gas. The course is framed by housing projects and other modest buildings on one side.","51","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"But out on the links, golfers are immersed in another world. While the greens were still dormant and therefore lacking in color, they nonetheless present a hilly tableau, offering vistas of the Manhattan skyline and the glittering East River around every corner.","52","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"On Wednesday, despite temperatures in the 40s, more than 30 foursomes were out on the links, which were designed by Jack Nicklaus and John Sanford in the Scottish style — without trees. (The landscape was in part dictated by the limitations of a former landfill.)","53","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"Among the players was the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., who insisted that his score was off the record. “I’m out here on Day 1, letting people know that we have a world-class, P.G.A. links-style golf course right here in the boogie-down Bronx,” he said right before making a crisp drive that elicited whistles from onlookers.","54","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"“That was on the record!” he shouted. Half of the course’s 100 employees are Bronx residents.","55","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"Higher greens fees do not seem to have scared off potential players. In mid-March, the course started taking reservations for April. “Within 15 minutes all the prime time slots had sold out for every weekend,” said Ronald C. Lieberman, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization.","56","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"The development of the course was plagued by problems, including the discovery of toxic substances in the soil. A deal with a developer, Ferry Point Partners, to build the course fell apart in 2006.","57","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"The city then built the 192-acre course itself, using city contractors, but costs eventually ballooned to $127 million, and critics questioned the need for an upscale golf course in a borough where a third of residents live below the poverty line. The Trump Organization was chosen in 2010 to operate the course after several earlier attempts to find an operator failed.","58","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"
"The company will soon start construction on a permanent, $10 million clubhouse, which it will finance. In the meantime, a temporary clubhouse has a pro shop and an outdoor grill under a yellow-and-white striped awning.","59","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/nyregion/luxury-public-golf-course-run-by-trump-opens-on-former-bronx-dump.html?_r=0"

"There will be an official opening ceremony in May, with Mr. Trump, Mr. Nicklaus, the parks commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, and others. By then the grass should be bright green.

"DORAL, Fla. — Jorge Ramos, the Univision and Fusion television anchor who is often called the Walter Cronkite of Latino America, was in his suburban Miami broadcast studio when he all but pounced on the chairman of the Republican Party, Reince Priebus, who was appearing from Washington. The Republicans’ immigration policy is “deportations, deportations, deportations,” Mr. Ramos said. “Why?”","JAN. 23, 2015","63","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"

"For years, Mr. Ramos largely aimed his ire at President Obama for breaking his 2008 campaign promise — made directly to Mr. Ramos — that he would propose an overhaul of the nation’s immigration system in his first year in office, and for deporting two million people since. Even after Mr. Obama announced late last year that nearly half of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants could apply to work without fear of deportation, Mr. Ramos confronted him during a Nashville forum for having “destroyed many families” by not acting sooner.","66","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"

"This weekend, the Spanish-language Univision, and Fusion, its English-language venture with ABC News, will cover the first gathering of 2016 Republican presidential aspirants, at a conservative forum in Des Moines on Saturday organized by Representative Steve King of Iowa. Mr. King, an immigration hard-liner, is well known to Latinos for remarks like one claiming that most young border-crossers have “calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana.”","68","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"
"That coverage follows Mr. Ramos’s in-depth reporting last week of House Republicans’ vote to block Mr. Obama’s immigration orders and deport up to four million people, mainly so-called Dreamers brought to the United States as children and the parents of American citizens. Given Republicans’ immigration stance, Mr. Ramos expects to cover more such stories through 2016.","69","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"

"“Remember what L.B.J. said, ‘When you lose Walter Cronkite, you’ve lost the war’?” said Matthew Dowd, a campaign adviser to George W. Bush, recalling the oft-cited if disputed story that President Lyndon B. Johnson said he lost “middle America” when Cronkite turned against the Vietnam War. Among Latino voters, Mr. Ramos has the sort of influence and audience that Cronkite had more broadly among Americans in his day.","71","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"

"How Republicans are perceived among Latinos mattered little in the midterm elections last year, when the party won control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in Mr. Obama’s presidency. Turnout of Latinos and other minority voters was, as usual, much lower than for presidential elections, and most close contests were in places with few Latinos.","73","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"
"But in 2016, the Republican record will matter. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, who said during the campaign that undocumented residents should “self-deport” — a position he defended in an interview last November on Univision — got only 27 percent of Latinos’ votes. Republican strategists say their 2016 nominee must get more than 40 percent to win. The last Republican candidate to do so was Mr. Bush, who had supported a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.","74","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"
"Early signs in both the Republican-run Congress and the presidential nomination race suggest how far Republicans have veered from the immigration course recommended two years ago when the party, at Mr. Priebus’s direction, produced an autopsy of Republicans’ 2012 losses that concluded that they must do more to engage Latino voters and propose “positive solutions on immigration.”","75","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"
"Republicans “should pay a lot of attention” to Mr. Ramos, said Carlos M. Gutierrez, a commerce secretary to Mr. Bush. “When Steve King made that terrible comment about kids with legs the size of cantaloupes, that was on Spanish-language TV the same day,” Mr. Gutierrez recalled.","76","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Ramos disputed that he was interested only in immigration and cited the range of issues he covers on the nightly news program “Noticiero Univision”; his Sunday show, “Al Punto”; and his weekly program on Fusion for young Latinos and other millennials, “America With Jorge Ramos.” He said that for Latinos, “just like for the rest of America,” the economy and education were the most important issues.","81","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/us/politics/jorge-ramos-tv-voice-of-latino-voters-sends-shiver-through-gop.html?_r=0"

"But in a city where aides and operatives take an almost perverse pleasure in checking their email in the middle of the night when they wake up to go to the bathroom; in a Capitol complex where lawmakers are often trailed by “purse boys” and “body men”; and in a building that still employs staff to press the elevator buttons for the senators, some members seem to take pride in not emailing.","150","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/us/politics/storing-emails-from-these-senators-will-be-easy-if-they-ever-send-one.html?_r=0"
"In some ways, after all, eschewing email can be seen as the ultimate status symbol — second only to sending someone to fetch your lunch. Mr. Graham — rarely a sympathizer with Mrs. Clinton — could have given her tips.

"CASTAIC, Calif. — When Kamala D.

"But now, at age 50 and after winning a second term, Ms. Harris has suddenly established herself as the dominant candidate in the race to replace Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat who announced in January that she would retire next year.

"Recidivism, a subject about which she wrote a book — “You can get it for $2.99 on Amazon,” Ms. Harris said — has been one issue she has focused on as attorney general.

"Still, questions remain about what kind of candidate she will be. She has been involved in only one tough statewide contest, her first run for attorney general, and she came close to losing. “She is going to have to enter into an entirely new political arena,” said Gale Kaufman, a Democratic political consultant in Sacramento. “Up until now, she primarily talked about issues that either were related to her being the D.A. or the attorney general.”","382","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/politics/kamala-harris-californias-attorney-general-leaps-to-forefront-of-race-for-barbara-boxers-senate-seat.html?_r=0"

"Ms. Harris, for example, said she did not have an opinion on whether the high-speed train that Mr. Brown has made a centerpiece of his administration — and which has drawn strong opposition from Republicans — should proceed. “I haven’t looked closely enough at it as an issue where I’ve formed an opinion,” she said.","385","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/politics/kamala-harris-californias-attorney-general-leaps-to-forefront-of-race-for-barbara-boxers-senate-seat.html?_r=0"
"“I’m a career prosecutor,” she said. “I have been trained, and my experience over decades, is to make decisions after a review of the evidence and the facts.

"Ms. Harris pointed to her attorney general race as evidence of her strength going into this campaign. “A lot of folks said we wouldn’t be able to win from the beginning: ‘This D.A. from San Francisco, this woman of color who is against the death penalty, running to become the top cop of the state,’” she said.","387","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/politics/kamala-harris-californias-attorney-general-leaps-to-forefront-of-race-for-barbara-boxers-senate-seat.html?_r=0"

"On Thursday, Mr. McConnell sent a detailed letter to every governor in the United States laying out a carefully researched legal argument as to why states should not comply with Mr. Obama’s regulations.

"To make his case, Mr. McConnell is also relying on a network of powerful allies with national influence and roots in Kentucky or the coal industry. Within that network is Laurence H. Tribe, a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law at Harvard Law School and a former mentor of Mr. Obama’s.

"Mr. Pence, in a long and sometimes anguished news conference, said Tuesday that he was working with Indiana lawmakers to devise an amendment to “clarify” that the law does not grant businesses a right to discriminate against anyone. But civil rights groups said the law seemed to have been written to do exactly that — in particular, to protect conservative Christian vendors who decline to provide services to same-sex wedding celebrations. And many of the law’s strongest supporters have openly declared that they hope it will help Christians avoid involvement in same-sex weddings.","444","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"
"The back-and-forth over the measures in Indiana and Arkansas has only deepened the confusion over what the laws would or would not do. Critics describe them as offensive, and a stark example of conservative activism. Supporters describe them as just protection for “religious freedom” — and they note that previous versions of the laws, adopted by Congress in 1993 and by 19 other states since then, attracted bipartisan support.","445","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"

"But more recent versions of such laws, like the one in Indiana and the legislation nearing adoption by Arkansas, contain language that broadens the potential impact. For example, both laws apply religious rights to corporations and say that the law can be invoked in private lawsuits, not just when a government agency has taken action said to impinge on a party’s religious beliefs.","450","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"
"The 1993 federal law was narrower in scope. It arose in response to a case in which two members of the Native American Church in Oregon had been fired from their jobs in a drug treatment center after they used peyote, an illegal drug, in a religious ceremony and then the state refused to pay them unemployment benefits. The United States Supreme Court upheld Oregon’s decision not to pay benefits, provoking a bipartisan drive in Congress to pass a law that would deter government actions that impinge upon religious beliefs.","451","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"

"The federal and state laws all set up a common structure: When people feel that a “state action,” like a fine or mandate, imposes a severe burden on their religious beliefs, they can go to court, where a judge must determine whether the action is warranted by a “compelling” governmental interest that is being achieved in the least burdensome manner possible.","453","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"
"Over time, civil rights advocates have come to argue that many of these laws are increasingly used not to protect vulnerable religious minorities but to allow some religious groups to impose their views on others.

"Initially, these laws were described as a way to protect individuals from harm — to prevent the government from forcing people to violate their beliefs unless there was a sound reason and no good alternative. They continue to be invoked in this manner, often without great controversy: Just this year, the Supreme Court said that federal officials could not prevent a Muslim prisoner from wearing a short beard, since the ban did not serve any overriding governmental interest.","457","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"
"But over time, in the view of many civil rights advocates, the laws were used in lawsuits and court decisions that went beyond the original intent, allowing people to act in the name of religion in ways that impinged on the rights of others. In some cases in the 1990s, for example, landlords cited their Christian beliefs to justify refusing to rent a house to an unmarried heterosexual couple. So groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which initially supported the laws, became far more wary and more recently have not supported the “religious freedom” proposals unless they include explicit antidiscrimination protections, an approach that was rejected by the Indiana legislature.","458","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"
"In last year’s Hobby Lobby case, the Supreme Court also seemed to expand the notion of a “person” who could claim religious burdens, allowing a large, family-owned for-profit corporation to refuse to provide insurance coverage for certain contraceptives that was mandated under the Affordable Care Act.","459","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"
"Now, the rapid spread of same-sex marriage — and the possibility that the Supreme Court will make it the law of the land later this year — has given a new impetus to these laws. Religious conservatives say that if same-sex marriage must exist, those who find it sinful should not be forced to participate in any way. Under laws like the one in Indiana, they say, vendors such as florists, bakers and photographers should be able to refuse to sell their services for same-sex wedding celebrations.","460","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"

"A. Mr. Pence is right when he says there has been exaggeration of the likely effects of the law and misunderstanding of how it works. It does not create an unchecked new right for restaurant owners, for example, to refuse to serve gay men or lesbians.

"Many of those who pushed for Indiana’s law have explicitly said that they hope it will protect vendors who refuse to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies, helping them avoid actions that according to their beliefs are onerous and sinful. Less clear is how often that might occur, and how often those vendors might win in court.","464","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"
"To civil rights advocates, “religious freedom,” in this case, is code for simple discrimination and would not only inconvenience gay and lesbian couples, but also would relegate them to a form of second-class status. Those selling to the public should not be able to turn away customers because of their own private beliefs, these advocates say; the vendor is, after all, selling flowers, and is not required to embrace the beliefs of the customers. These critics ask: How would the public respond if businesses offered religious reasons for refusing to serve interracial couples?","465","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"

"In fact, the bills in both Indiana and Arkansas include provisions that are not in the federal law or most other states’ laws, and that could broaden the scope of protection for religious businesses. Both of them say that for-profit corporations that are substantially owned by members of a faith can claim protections under the law. And both of the versions broaden the definition of “state action,” stating, in the Indiana legislation, for example, that a person who feels his religious rights are being violated may assert protection under the law “in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.”","469","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/politics/context-for-the-debate-on-religious-freedom-measures-in-indiana-and-arkansas.html?_r=0"
"This latter clause, a version of which is also in the Arkansas bill, appears to be a response to events in New Mexico in 2013, when a photographer said she would not photograph a same-sex wedding because of her Christian beliefs.

"So now, in the Indiana and Arkansas legislation, language is included to ensure that parties in private lawsuits or administrative actions can claim a religious basis for their questioned behavior.

"Nevertheless, Mr. Pence was wrong when he said that the Indiana law was identical to those once supported by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama.

"A few moments ago, we heard the president lay out his vision for the year to come. Even if we may not always agree, it’s important to hear different points of view in this great country. We appreciate the president sharing his.","481","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"Tonight, though, rather than respond to a speech, I’d like to talk about your priorities. I’d like to have a conversation about the new Republican Congress you just elected and how we plan to make Washington focus on your concerns again.","482","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"

"The new Republican Congress also understands how difficult these past six years have been. For many of us, the sting of the economy and the frustration with Washington’s dysfunction weren’t things we had to read about; we felt them every day.","484","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"

"You see, growing up, I had only one good pair of shoes. So on rainy school days, my mom would slip plastic bread bags over them to keep them dry. But I was never embarrassed, because the school bus would be filled with rows and rows of young Iowans with bread bags slipped over their feet.","488","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"

"We see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs. We see the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans and higher monthly insurance bills. We see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they’ll be able to leave to their children.","491","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like “Obamacare.” It’s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.","492","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"That’s why the new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, we’re working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve.","493","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"One you’ve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill. President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. the president’s own State Department has said Keystone’s construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact.","494","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"

"President Obama will soon have a decision to make. Will he sign the bill or block good American jobs?","496","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"

"Let’s tear down trade barriers in places like Europe and the Pacific. Let’s sell more of what we make and grow in America over there so we can boost manufacturing, wages and jobs right here at home.","498","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"Let’s simplify America’s outdated and loophole-ridden tax code. Republicans think tax filing should be easier for you, not just the well-connected. So let’s iron out loopholes to lower rates and create jobs, not pay for more government spending.","499","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"The president has already expressed some support for these kinds of ideas. We’re calling on him now to cooperate to pass them.","500","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"

"Some of it will occur where I stand tonight, in the Armed Services Committee room. This is where I’ll join committee colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to discuss ways to support our exceptional military and its mission. This is where we’ll debate strategies to confront terrorism and the threats posed by Al Qaeda, ISIL and those radicalized by them.","502","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"We know threats like these can’t just be wished away. We’ve been reminded of terrorism’s reach both at home and abroad, most recently in France and Nigeria but also in places like Canada and Australia.","503","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"Our hearts go out to all the innocent victims of terrorism and their loved ones. We can only imagine the depth of their grief.","504","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"For two decades, I’ve proudly worn our nation’s uniform, today, as a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. While deployed overseas with some of America’s finest men and women, I’ve seen just how dangerous these kinds of threats can be.","505","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"The forces of violence and oppression don’t care about the innocent. We need a comprehensive plan to defeat them.","506","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"We must also honor America’s veterans. These men and women have sacrificed so much in defense of our freedoms and our way of life. They deserve nothing less than the benefits they were promised and a quality of care we can be all be proud of.","507","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"

"We’ll also keep fighting to repeal and replace a health care law that’s hurt so many hardworking families, we’ll work to correct executive overreach, we’ll propose ideas that aim to cut wasteful spending and balance the budget with meaningful reforms, not higher taxes like the president has proposed, we’ll advance solutions to prevent the kind of cyber attacks we’ve seen recently, we’ll work to confront Iran’s nuclear ambitions, and we’ll defend life, because protecting our most vulnerable is an important measure of any society.","509","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"

"We know America faces big challenges, but history has shown there’s nothing our nation, and our people, can’t accomplish.","511","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"

"They had very little to call their own except the sweat on their brow and the dirt on their hands. But they worked, they sacrificed, and they dreamed big dreams for their children and grandchildren.","513","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"And because they did, an ordinary Iowan like me has had some truly extraordinary opportunities — because they showed me that you don’t need to come from wealth or privilege to make a difference. You just need the freedom to dream big, and a whole lot of hard work.","514","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html?_r=0"
"The new Republican Congress you elected is working to make Washington understand that too.

"Bill Clinton’s hearing has faded. With his head of white hair and frail frame, he looks older than his 68 years — “truly grandfatherly,” as one friend said. He often jokes about what would happen if he were to “drop dead.”","MARCH 28, 2015","518","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"But even if his step has slowed, Mr. Clinton is hungering once again to play a central role in his wife’s presidential campaign. And Hillary Rodham Clinton’s advisers are once again grappling with how to deploy Mr. Clinton, a strategic imperative that was executed so poorly in 2008 that it resulted in some of the worst moments of her campaign.","519","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"In that race, the former president was at times a frustrated and unpredictable presence, operating on his own, calling up some of his wife’s aides to second-guess strategy and shifting the news media’s focus from her to him with stray remarks, such as when he set off African-American anger by diminishing Barack Obama’s success in South Carolina.","520","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"This time, advisers and political associates say both Clintons understand how critical it is to harness both the rare gifts and rash impulses of a former president on behalf of a potential one. Whether this will work is a great unknown of the 2016 race: If Mr. Clinton veers far off script with just one stunner of a comment, the campaign could stumble.","521","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"Some plans are already forming, the couple’s advisers say. Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to announce her candidacy next month, will shoulder most retail campaign events without him this year, even though Mr. Clinton is more of a natural at them. Putting her in close-in settings with voters at house parties and diners will allow her to avoid Mr. Clinton’s shadow, while underscoring the message that she is taking no voter for granted.","522","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Clinton has talked to friends about courting a demographic group that he sees as crucial in the next election — Latinos — as well as reaching out to other key constituencies like African-Americans, to elected officials and to high-dollar donors.","523","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"In hopes of collaborating with Mr. Clinton better than in 2008 — if not controlling him outright — advisers to Mrs. Clinton are involving him more closely in early campaign planning, and they are discussing whether to deploy a senior aide to travel with him to keep him focused on his wife’s central message. The strategy would channel his myriad political talents, such as synthesizing polling data with ground operations in important states like Florida, which he is preoccupied with winning in 2016. Mr. Clinton views both former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio as particular threats, given their strength in that state — their mutual home base — and their ability to reach out (in fluent Spanish) to Hispanic voters.","524","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"They are also making sure he has clear channels to share ideas and concerns with important players besides Mrs. Clinton; the likely campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff in the Clinton administration, and the campaign manager Robby Mook will be taking his calls.","525","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"But the terrain is tricky: Mr. Clinton is never as enraged or unpredictable as when his wife comes under attack. He will also remain focused on the Clinton Foundation, which has come under criticism for its fund-raising practices. (While Mrs. Clinton is likely to be campaigning in the next several months, Mr. Clinton will have a packed schedule of foundation-related events, including a big trip to Africa with supporters of his charity.) He runs the risk of reinforcing a Republican argument that the Clintons are America’s baby boomer past and do not represent a generational change in leadership. And he remains a wild card: What part would he play if he returned to the White House as first gentleman?","526","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"“I can’t think of anything tougher than being him in Secretary Clinton’s presidential campaign, because no matter what he does, people will take exception to it,” said Jerry Crawford, who was Mrs. Clinton’s Midwest co-chairman in 2008 and Mr. Clinton’s Iowa state director in 1992 and 1996.","527","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"“But at the same time, who would you rather have as a messenger and a strategist?” added Mr. Crawford, who speaks to the Clintons regularly. “And he learned a lot in 2008. First and foremost, he found out the last time how hard it is to be objective when it’s your spouse running.”","528","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"In the years since the bruising 2008 primary campaign, Mr. Clinton has regained his image as a Democratic stalwart, particularly by being a devoted surrogate to Mr. Obama and delivering a much-praised speech at the party’s convention in 2012. Fifty-six percent of Americans have a positive opinion of Mr. Clinton, making him more popular than both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, according to a Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll released this month. Mr. Clinton’s state of mind these days, according to people who are associated with him, can be summed up as Zen and jolly.","529","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Clinton has also brushed up on how modern campaigns are waged. “The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns,” a 2012 book by Sasha Issenberg about how data and analytics have upended presidential campaigns, caught Mr. Clinton’s eye in an article he read. Still, Mr. Clinton often cannot help being himself. And nothing animates him more than offering his views on political strategy, sometimes with surprising company.","530","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"

"“President Clinton still has one of the most politically strategic and tactical minds in America, and you want that on your side,” said Jay S. Jacobs, a prominent New York Democrat who speaks periodically with both Clintons. “He watches candidates. He knows their strengths and weaknesses. And he’s always interested in talking about the Electoral College map, down to the congressional district.”","532","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"That tendency to analyze out loud turned into a liability when he saw his wife’s shot at the presidency in 2008 begin to slip away. After it became apparent Mr. Obama won the South Carolina primary that year, Mr. Clinton memorably compared the victory to Rev. Jesse L. Jackson’s two victories in the state, seeming to marginalize the achievement. He also called Mr. Obama’s antiwar position “the biggest fairy tale I’ve ever seen,” a comment that enraged some African-Americans who interpreted the comment to mean that Mr. Obama’s candidacy was a fantasy.","533","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"“He had some bumps in the road down here,” said State Senator John W.

"Wearing a red checkered button-down shirt that resembled a picnic blanket, Mr. Clinton held a 15-minute impromptu powwow with reporters and delivered a 30-minute speech about topics as varied as development in Haiti and the conservative megadonors Charles G. and David H.

"On an organizational level, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers are taking steps to avoid 2008-style dysfunction when Mr. Clinton’s team functioned apart from her campaign.

"Making sure Mr. Clinton has his own campaign aides is a priority: As he has aged and retained a demanding schedule, he has become more dependent on a staff. Mr. Clinton, who has lost more than 20 pounds since 2008, sends an aide to buy his dress shirts at Bergdorf Goodman, and when he steps out of his S.U.V., he sometimes spreads his arms awaiting an aide to put his jacket on each arm.","541","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"
"Perhaps the person best positioned to keep Mr. Clinton from overdoing it is his daughter, Chelsea, who in recent years has taken on a leadership position at the Clinton Foundation. He has said that if his wife wins the White House, he will maintain the family’s home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and continue to lead the philanthropy. “I hope I’ll get permission to keep this foundation going,” Mr. Clinton recently told Queen Latifah on her talk show.","542","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/us/politics/to-avert-repeat-of-2008-clinton-team-hopes-to-keep-bill-at-his-best.html?_r=0"

"Late in February, Dr. Ben Carson, the celebrated pediatric neurosurgeon turned political insurrectionist, was trying to check off another box on his presidential-campaign to-do list: hiring a press secretary. The lead prospect, a public-relations specialist named Deana Bass, had come to meet him at the dimly lit Capitol Hill office of Carson’s confidant and business manager, Armstrong Williams. Carson sat back and scrutinized her from behind a small granite table, as life-size cardboard cutouts of more conventional politicians — President Obama, with a tight smile, and Senator John McCain, glowering — loomed behind each of his shoulders. (The mock $3 bill someone had left on a table in Williams’s waiting room undercut any notion that this was a bipartisan zone; it featured Obama wearing a turban.)","MARCH 17, 2015","570","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Bass seemed momentarily speechless, and not just because no one had warned her that a New York Times reporter would be sitting in on her job interview. Though she knew Williams — a jack-of-all-trades entrepreneur who owns several television stations and a public-affairs business and who hosts a daily talk-radio show — through Washington’s small circle of black conservatives, the two hadn’t spoken in years until he called her two days earlier. He had been struggling to come up with the perfect national spokesperson, he told her. Then, at the gym, her name popped into his head; Williams was fairly certain she was the one. Sitting across from a likely candidate for president, Bass was adjusting to the idea that her life might be about to take a sudden chaotic turn.","571","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"

"Carson concurred: “It’s always how he works in my life.” Carson is soft-spoken and often talks with his eyes half closed, frequently punctuating his sentences with a small laugh, even if the humor of his statement is not readily apparent. Bass told Carson that she had been a Republican staff member on Capitol Hill then worked for the Republican National Committee. In 2007 she started a Christian public-relations firm with her sister. She enjoyed working on the Hill, she said, but the pay wasn’t as high as the hours were long. “We figured that we worked like slaves for other people, and we wanted to work for ourselves.”","573","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson stopped her. “You know you can’t mention that word, right?” Carson waited a beat, then laughed, and Williams and Bass joined in. He was getting to the point; he needed a professional who could help him check his penchant for creating uncontrolled controversy just by talking.","574","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"The Ben Carson movement began in 2013, when Carson, a neurosurgeon, whose operating-room prowess and up-from-poverty back story had made him the subject of a television movie and a regular on the inspirational-speaking circuit, was invited to address the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. With Barack Obama sitting just two seats away, Carson warned that “moral decay” and “fiscal irresponsibility” could destroy America just as it did ancient Rome. He proposed a substitute for Obamacare — Health Savings Accounts, which, he said, would end any talk of “death panels” — and a flat-tax based on the concept of tithing. His address, combined with the president’s stony reaction, was a smash with Republican activists. Speaking and interview requests flooded in. Carson, then 61, announced his planned retirement a few weeks later, freeing his calendar to accept just about all of them. In the months that followed, his rhetoric became increasingly strident. The claim that drew the most attention, perhaps, was that Obamacare was “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.”","575","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"

"“If you want to reach people and have them even understand what you’re saying, there is a way to do it, without that hyperbole, that might be. . . . ” She paused. “I just think it’s important not to shut people off before they —”","577","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"

"Likening Obamacare to slavery — and slavery was incomparably worse, Carson said — had its political advantages for a candidacy like his. It was the kind of statement that stoked the angriest of the Republican voters: conservative stalwarts who can’t hear enough bad things about Obama. This, in turn, led to more talk-radio and Fox News appearances, more book sales, more donations to the super PAC started in his name, more support in the polls. (The day before the meeting, one poll of Republican voters showed Carson statistically tied for first place with Jeb Bush and Scott Walker.)","580","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Rhetorical excess was good for business, but Carson now wants to be seen as more than a novelty candidate. He has come to learn that such extreme analogies, while true to his views, aren’t especially presidential. They alienate more moderate voters and, perhaps even more damaging, reinforce the impression that he is not “serious” — that he is another Herman Cain, the black former Godfather’s Pizza chief executive who rose to the top of the early presidential polls in 2011 but then bowed out before the Iowa caucuses, largely because of leaked allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied but from which he never recovered. Cain lingers as a cautionary tale for the party as much as for a right-leaning candidate like Carson. The fact that Cain, with his folksy sayings (“shucky ducky”) and misnomers (“Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan”), reached the top of the national polls — much less that he was eventually followed there by the likes of Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, who all topped one or another poll in the 2012 primary season — wound up being a considerable embarrassment for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney, and for the longtime party regulars who were trying to fast-track his way to the nomination.","581","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson liked Bass and, without directly saying so, made it clear the job was hers for the taking. Carson’s campaign chairman, Terry Giles — a white lawyer whose clients have included the comedian Richard Pryor and the stepson of the model Anna Nicole Smith and who helped reconcile the business interests of the descendants of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. — had assembled a mostly white campaign team, including many from the 2012 Gingrich effort, and Carson wanted a person of color to speak for him. Bass said she would have to mull it over, pray about it. Carson nodded approvingly. “Pray about it,” he said. “See what you think.”","582","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Williams knew the party was intent on protecting the eventual 2016 nominee from the same embarrassment Romney suffered. Already, suspiciously tough articles about Carson were showing up in conservative magazines and on right-wing websites. “They’re protecting these establishment candidates,” Williams said. “This is coming from within the house. This is family.” At the very least, he wanted to make sure that Carson didn’t do their work for them. (Carson would commit another unforced error a week later, when he told CNN that homosexuality was clearly a choice, because a lot of people go in prison straight and “when they come out, they’re gay”; he later apologized.)","583","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"“We need somebody to protect him, sometimes, from himself,” he told Bass — laughing, but only half kidding.","584","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"A candidacy like Carson’s presents a new kind of problem to the establishment wing of the G.O.P., which, at least since 1980, has selected its presidential nominees with a routine efficiency that Democrats could only envy. The establishment candidate has usually been a current or former governor or senator, blandly Protestant, hailing from the moderate, big-business wing of the party (or at least friendly with it) and almost always a second-, third- or fourth-time national contender — someone who had waited “his turn.” These candidates would tack predictably to the right during the primaries to satisfy the evangelicals, deficit hawks, libertarian leaners and other inconvenient but vital constituents who made up the “base” of the party. In return, the base would, after a brief flirtation with some fantasy candidate like Steve Forbes or Pat Buchanan, “hold their noses” and deliver their votes come November. This bargain was always tenuous, of course, and when some of the furthest-right activists turned against George W. Bush, citing (among other apostasies) his expansion of Medicare’s prescription drug benefit, it began to fall apart. After Barack Obama defeated McCain in 2008, the party’s once dependable base started to reconsider the wisdom of holding their noses at all.","585","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"This insurgent attitude was helped along by changes in the nomination rules. In 2010, the Republican National Committee, hoping to capture the excitement of the coast-to-coast Democratic primary competition between Obama and Hillary Clinton, introduced new voting rules that required many of the early voting states to award some delegates to losing candidates, based on their shares of the vote. The proportional voting rules would encourage struggling candidates to stay in the primaries even after successive losses, as Clinton did, because they might be able to pull together enough delegates to take the nomination in a convention-floor fight or at least use them to bargain for a prime speaking slot or cabinet post.","586","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"This shift in incentives did not go unnoticed by potential 2012 candidates, nor did changes in election law that allowed billionaire donors to form super PACs in support of pet candidacies. At the same time, increasingly widespread broadband Internet access allowed candidates to reach supporters directly with video and email appeals and supporters to send money with the tap of a smartphone, making it easier than ever for individual candidates to ignore the wishes of the party.","587","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Into this newly chaotic Republican landscape strode Mitt Romney. There could be no doubt that it was his turn, and yet his journey to the nomination was interrupted by one against-the-odds challenger after another — Cain, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul; always Ron Paul. It was easy to dismiss the 2012 primaries as a meaningless circus, but the onslaught did much more than tarnish the overall Republican brand. It also forced Romney to spend money he could have used against Obama and defend his right flank with embarrassing pandering that shadowed him through the general election. It was while trying to block a surge from Gingrich, for instance, that Romney told a debate audience that he was for the “self-deportation” of undocumented immigrants.","588","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"At the 2012 convention in Tampa, a group of longtime party hands, including Romney’s lawyer, Ben Ginsberg, gathered to discuss how to prevent a repeat of what had become known inside and outside the party as the “clown show.” Their aim was not just to protect the party but also to protect a potential President Romney from a primary challenge in 2016. They forced through new rules that would give future presumptive nominees more control over delegates in the event of a convention fight. They did away with the mandatory proportional delegate awards that encouraged long-shot candidacies. And, in a noticeably targeted effort, they raised the threshold that candidates needed to meet to enter their names into nomination, just as Ron Paul’s supporters were working to reach it. When John A. Boehner gaveled the rules in on a voice vote — a vote that many listeners heard as a tie, if not an outright loss — the hall erupted and a line of Ron Paul supporters walked off the floor in protest, along with many Tea Party members.","589","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"At a party meeting last winter, Reince Priebus, who as party chairman is charged with maintaining the support of all his constituencies, did restore some proportional primary and caucus voting, but only in states that held voting within a shortened two-week window. And he also condensed the nominating schedule to four and a half months from six months, and, for the first time required candidates to participate in a shortened debate schedule, determined by the party, not by the whims of the networks. (The panel that recommended those changes included names closely identified with the establishment — the former Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, the Mississippi committeeman Haley Barbour and, notably, Jeb Bush’s closest adviser, Sally Bradshaw.)","590","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Grass-roots activists have complained that the condensed schedule robs nonestablishment candidates — “movement candidates” like Carson — of the extra time they need to build momentum, money and organizations. But Priebus, who says the nomination could be close to settled by April, said it helped all the party’s constituencies when the nominee was decided quickly. “We don’t need a six-month slice-and-dice festival,” Priebus said when we spoke in mid-March. “While I can’t always control everyone’s mouth, I can control how long we can kill each other.”","591","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"All the rules changes were built to sidestep the problems of 2012. But the 2016 field is shaping up to be vastly different and far larger. A new Republican hints that he or she is considering a run seemingly every week. There are moderates like Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. George Pataki of New York; no-compromise conservatives like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania; business-wingers like the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina; one-of-a-kinds like Donald Trump — some 20 in all, a dozen or so who seem fairly serious about it. That opens the possibility of multiple candidates vying for all the major Republican constituencies, some of them possibly goaded along by super-PAC-funding billionaires, all of them trading wins and collecting delegates well into spring.","592","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Giles says his candidate can capitalize on all that chaos. Rivals may laugh, but Giles argues that if Carson can make a respectable showing in Iowa, then win in South Carolina — or at least come in second should a home-state senator, Lindsey Graham, run — and come in second behind Bush or Senator Marco Rubio in their home state of Florida, he could be positioned to make a real run. But that would depend on avoiding pitfalls like Carson’s ill-considered comments on homosexuality.

"Ben Carson is, in many ways, the ideal Republican presidential candidate. With a not-too-selective reading of his life story, conservative voters can — and do — see in him an inspiring, up-from-nowhere African-American who shares their beliefs, a right-wing answer to Barack Obama. Before he was born, his parents moved to Detroit from rural Tennessee as part of the second great migration. His father, Robert Solomon Carson, worked at a Cadillac factory. His mother, Sonya — who herself had grown up as one of 24 children and left school at third grade — cleaned houses. When Carson was 8, Sonya discovered that Robert was keeping a second family. She moved, with her two sons, into a rundown group house. It was in a part of town that Carson described to me as crawling with “big rats and roaches and all kinds of horrible things.” Sonya worked several jobs at a time and made up the shortfall with food stamps. (Carson has called for paring back the social safety net but not doing away with it.)","594","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson recounts this story in his best-selling 1990 memoir, “Gifted Hands,” which also became the basis for a 2009 movie on TNT, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carson. Raised as a Seventh Day Adventist, Carson realized that he wanted to become a physician during a church sermon about a missionary doctor who, while serving overseas, was almost attacked by thieves but found safety by putting his faith in God. When Carson, then 8, told his mother his new dream, “She said, ‘Absolutely, you could do it, you could do anything,’ ” he told me. Forced by his mother to read two extra books a week, he made it to Yale, then to medical school at the University of Michigan, where he decided to specialize in neurosurgery. He was selected for residency at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, where he was named director of pediatric neurosurgery at 33, becoming the youngest person, and the first black person, to hold the title. He drew national attention by conducting a succession of operations that had never been performed successfully, most famously planning and managing the first separation of conjoined twins connected through major blood vessels in the brain.","595","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson, a two-time Jimmy Carter voter, traces his conservative political awakening to a patient he met during the Reagan years. During a routine obstetrics rotation, he found himself treating an unwed pregnant teenager who had run away from her well-to-do parents. When Carson asked her how she was getting by, she informed him she was on public assistance; this led him to ponder the fact that the government was paying for the result of what he did not view as a “wise decision.” The incident, he says, fed his growing sense that the welfare system too often saps motivation and rewards irresponsible behavior. (When we spoke, he suggested that the government should cut off assistance to would-be unwed mothers, but only after warning them that it would do so within a certain amount of time, say five years. “I bet you’d see a dramatic decrease in unwed motherhood.”)","596","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Carson’s friends at Hopkins say they do not remember him being particularly outspoken about his conservatism. He devoted most of his public engagement to urging poor kids in bad neighborhoods to use “these fancy brains God gave us,” through weekly school visits, student hospital tours and, ultimately, a multimillion-dollar scholarship program. “His issues were always medical care for the poor, education for the poor, equal opportunity — helping the less fortunate and really inspiring them as an example,” a mentor who named him to the chief pediatrics-neurosurgery post at Hopkins, Dr. Donlin Long, told me.","597","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Even when Carson got the chance, in 1997, to speak in front of President Bill Clinton, at the national prayer breakfast, he mostly discussed the lack of role models for black children who were not sports stars or rappers. (There was possibly an oblique reference to Clinton’s sex scandals, when he told the audience that, if they are always honest, they won’t have to worry later about “skeletons in the closet.”)","598","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"In 2011, Carson’s politics took a strident turn, mirroring that of many in his party during the Obama years. “America the Beautiful,” his sixth book, which he wrote with Candy Carson, his wife of 39 years, included a get-tough-on-illegal-immigration message and offered anti-establishment praise for the Tea Party. It suggested that blacks who voted for Obama only because he was black were themselves practicing a form of racism. (Earlier this year he admitted to Buzzfeed that portions of the book were lifted directly from several sources without proper attribution.) His prayer-breakfast performance in 2013, and the extremity of his remarks in the months afterward (Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery; the United States is “very much like Nazi Germany”; allowing same-sex marriage could lead to allowing bestiality), left some of his old friends bewildered. Students at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine protested his planned convocation address there in 2013, and he eventually backed out. When I asked Carson about the view at Hopkins that he had changed, he said his themes are still the same: “hard work, self-reliance, helping other people.” If he had become more overtly political, he said, it was only because the Obama years had led him to believe that “we’re really moving in a direction that is very, very destructive.”","599","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"None of this went unnoticed by campaign professionals. In August 2013, John Philip Sousa IV and Vernon Robinson, each of whom professes to be a virtual stranger to Carson, and who had previously been active in the anti-illegal-immigration movement, started the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee. Sousa was just coming off a campaign to defend the sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, Joe Arpaio, from a recall effort, and he told me that he found Carson’s lack of political experience refreshing. “We have 500 guys and gals with probably a collective 5,000 years experience, and look at the mess we’re in,” he said.","600","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Many others in the party feel the same way. Carson’s PAC finished 2014 with more than $13 million in donations, more than Ready for Hillary. Much of its money has gone toward further fund-raising, but Sousa — the great-grandson of the famous composer — points out that their effort has already built far more than just a war chest, organizing leaders in all 99 of Iowa’s counties. Regardless, Carson credits the fund-raising success of Sousa and Robinson with persuading him to enter the race.","601","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Very early the morning after the job interview, Carson was in a black S.U.V., heading from Washington to the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Oxon Hill, Md., where he was to give the opening candidate speech of the Conservative Political Action Conference. The event, which functions as an early tryout for Republican presidential contenders, tends to skew rightward in its audience, drawing many of the same sorts of people who shouted at Boehner in Tampa. As such, it tends to favor anti-establishment candidates, but the news leading up to this year’s event was that Jeb Bush hoped to make inroads there.","602","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"It was still dark when we set out, and I joked with Carson about the hour, telling him he’d better get used to it. He retorted that his career in pediatric brain surgery made him no stranger to early mornings. This is a big theme of Carson’s presidential pitch: that neither the rigors of the campaign nor those of the White House can faze a man who held children’s lives in his hands. His life in brain surgery has prepared him for the presidency, he maintains, better than lives in politics have for his rivals. At the very least, he says, it conditioned him against getting too worked up about any problem that isn’t life threatening. “I mean, it’s grueling, but interestingly enough, I don’t feel the pressure,” he said.","603","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"At the convention hall, we were quickly surrounded by admirers. Two women were already waiting to meet him — white, middle-aged volunteers for Carson’s super PAC, who had traveled from South Carolina. One of them, Chris Horne, was holding a dog-eared and taped Bible. A founding member of the Charleston Tea Party who went on to work for Gingrich’s successful South Carolina primary campaign in 2012, Horne lamented over the attacks that Carson was sure to face. “You served us, you served the Lord, just don’t let them steal that from you,” she said. Her friend told him, “You’ve got God behind you!” Such religious evocations trailed Carson constantly while I walked the CPAC floor with him. Evangelicals are impressed not only with his devotion to their politics but also with his career path; as one of them told me, what’s more pro-life than saving babies?","604","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"During our ride to the conference, Carson told me his speech was not looking to “feed the beast.” When his appointed time came, he kept his remarks as tame as promised. “Real compassion” meant “using our intellect” to help people “climb out of dependency and realize the American dream,” he said. The national debt is going to “destroy us,” Obamacare was about “redistribution and control,” but Republicans better come forward with their own alternative before they repeal it, he said.","605","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Because his speech was first, and it started several minutes early, the auditorium was slow to fill. Still, the first day saw a crush of people seeking autographs and pictures as he roamed the hall. The Draft Carson committee’s 150 volunteers swarmed the auditorium, collecting emails and handing out “Run Ben Run” stickers. After a quick interview with Sean Hannity, the conservative-radio and Fox News host — his second in two days — Carson was off to Tampa.","606","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"In the hours that followed his talk, the hall offered a view in miniature of what the next 12 to 14 months might hold for the party. Chris Christie, sitting across from the tough-minded talk-radio host Laura Ingraham, boasted about his multiple vetoes of Planned Parenthood funding, his refusal to raise income taxes and his belief that “sometimes people need to be told to sit down and shut up.” Cruz, an audience favorite, warning his fellow Republicans against falling for a “squishy moderate,” declared, “Take all 125,000 I.R.S. agents and put ’em on our Southern border!” Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, surging in polls, boasted that if he could face down the 100,000 union supporters who protested his legislation limiting collective bargaining for public employees, he could certainly handle ISIS. The next day, the traditional CPAC favorite Rand Paul spoke, packing the hall with his supporters who chanted “President Paul.” He warned, counter to the overall hawkish tenor of the event, that “we should not succumb to the notion that a government inept at home will somehow become successful abroad.” But he also vowed to end foreign aid to countries whose citizens are seen burning American flags. “Not one penny more to these haters of America.”","607","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"
"Perhaps the defining moment came near the end of the conference, when Jeb Bush spoke. In a neat trick of political gamesmanship — and a show of establishment muscle — his team had bused in an ample cheering section for the dozens of cameras on hand for his appearance. But a small contingent of Tea Party activists and Rand Paul supporters staged a walk out. When Bush began a question-and-answer session, they turned and left the auditorium to chant “U.S.A., U.S.A.” in the hallway, led by a man in colonial garb waving a huge “Don’t Tread on Me” banner. Plenty of other detractors stayed in the hall and peppered Bush’s remarks with booing as he stood by positions unpopular with the conservative grass roots: support for the Common Core standards and an immigration overhaul that provides a “path to legal status” for undocumented immigrants. Bush took it all in good humor, but finally seemed to give up.","608","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"

"The official who made the comments to The New York Times would not be named, and the White House declined to comment.

"In a telephone interview late Wednesday, Mr. Dermer said, “I have no regrets whatsoever that I have acted in a way to advance my country’s interests.” He said he never meant to slight the White House by keeping the confidence of the House speaker, who had suggested the invitation.

"“My understanding was that it was the speaker’s prerogative to do, and that he would be the one to inform the administration,” Mr. Dermer said. “The prime minister feels very strongly that he has to speak on this issue.

"In response, the White House has called the invitation a breach of diplomatic protocol and announced that Mr. Obama would not meet with Mr. Netanyahu when he visits. Administration officials maintained that the decision to avoid Mr. Netanyahu was consistent with a policy of not meeting with world leaders close to their elections — Israel’s is two weeks after the speech — to avoid the appearance of influence. But that policy has been ignored in the past. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have called the invitation a political stunt to undercut the president. It has also inserted Mr. Netanyahu into the middle of a dispute between Mr. Obama and congressional Republicans over new Iran sanctions, which the president opposes until international negotiations to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon play out.","719","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/us/politics/white-house-expresses-displeasure-over-speech-planned-by-netanyahu.html?_r=0"

"“This administration has repeatedly sought to both undermine and embarrass this prime minister, and the same Democrats who now profess to be so outraged by this have been notably silent,” Mr. Brooks said. “When the dust settles on this — and the dust will settle — I think that he’ll continue to be effective on the range of issues that are important to Israel’s security.”","727","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/us/politics/white-house-expresses-displeasure-over-speech-planned-by-netanyahu.html?_r=0"

"THE Donald Trump phenomenon is a great gift to pundits because it can be analyzed and criticized in so many different ways. But two shorthands seem particularly useful. First, Trump is essentially using the Republican primary to run a third-party campaign, not a right-wing insurgency. Second, Trump’s appeal is oddly like that of Franklin Roosevelt, in the sense that he’s a rich, well-connected figure — a rich New Yorker, at that — who’s campaigning as a traitor to his class.","AUG. 29, 2015","836","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"
"These two elements of Trumpism are intimately connected. In American politics, the two-party system, no less than the Senate or the Supreme Court, has long served as a check on pure democracy, a means of elite control. So long as there are only two competitive parties, the political diversity of the country will be channeled through their sluice gates, and the (mostly upper-class, highly-educated, self-consciously globalist) people who run the parties will exercise disproportionate control over which ideas find representation.","837","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"
"This does not mean the two parties are interchangeable, a Republicrat conspiracy against the public. A clash between powerful elites can still be a very real clash, as recent Supreme Court decisions attest.","838","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"

"But it does mean certain ideologies and worldviews get marginalized in national political debate. The libertarian who wants to cut defense spending, the anti-abortion voter who favors a bigger welfare state, the immigration skeptic who wants to keep Social Security exactly as it is … all these voters and many others choose the lesser of two evils every November, because neither party’s leadership has any interest in representing their entire worldview.","840","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"
"In certain ways this narrowing can be good for the republic. Elites can have wisdom that populists lack, certain ideas deserve suppression, and multiparty systems are more likely to hand power to extremists or buffoons. (It’s a good thing for the country that neither Henry Wallace’s effectively pro-Soviet leftism nor George Wallace’s segregationist populism outlived their respective third-party bids.)","841","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"
"And when the two-party system is functioning at its best, party leaders can integrate compelling third-party ideas, or even reorient a party entirely to react to a public discontented with its options.","842","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"
"But it has been more than four decades since the last such reorientation, and two decades since the last time a third-party candidate saw his ideas even co-opted by the major parties. Across the latter twenty years, the country has endured a series of disasters that had bipartisan fingerprints all over them. Yet the various movements that have arisen in reaction to those failures — the antiwar left, the Tea Party right, Occupy Wall Street – have yet to even unseat an incumbent president, let alone change the basic lines along which the two parties debate.","843","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"
"Which is where Trump comes in. So far he’s running against the Republican establishment in a more profound way than the Tea Party, challenging not just deviations from official conservative principle but the entire post-Reagan conservative matrix. He can wax right wing on immigration one moment and promise to tax hedge fund managers the next. He’ll attack political correctness and then pledge to protect entitlements. He can sound like Pat Buchanan on trade and Bernie Sanders on health care. He regularly attacks the entire Iraq misadventure, in its Bush-era and Obama-era manifestations alike, in a way that neither mainstream Republicans nor Hillary Clinton can plausibly manage.","844","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"
"And he’s coming at all these issues, crucially, from a vantage point of privilege — which his critics keep highlighting as though it discredits him, when in reality it lends his populism a deeper credibility. He’s the Acela Corridor billionaire (albeit tackier than most) who promises to reveal what the elites are really up to, the crony capitalist who can tell you just how corrupt D.C. really is, the financier who’ll tell you that high finance can afford higher taxes. It’s precisely because he isn’t a blue collar outsider that he may seem like a credible change agent: Because he knows Wall Street, and because he doesn’t need its money to campaign, it seems like he could actually fight his fellow elites and win.","845","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"
"He won’t, of course, but it matters a great deal how he loses. In a healthy two-party system, the G.O.P. would treat Trump’s strange success as evidence that the party’s basic orientation may need to change substantially, so that it looks less like a tool of moneyed interests and more like a vehicle for middle American discontent.","846","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-donald-trump-traitor-to-his-class.html?_r=0"
"In an unhealthy system, the kind I suspect we inhabit, the Republicans will find a way to crush Trump without adapting to his message.

"The rape and near-murder in Central Park rocked New York in the midst of the 1989 mayoral race, becoming a chilling symbol of a city seemingly out of control. Over time, it also came to represent the flaws in the criminal justice system. Five teenagers, four of them black, one Latino, were arrested and imprisoned for carrying out the attack. Known as the Central Park Five, they had their convictions vacated years later after another man, Matias Reyes, confessed to the crime.","1462","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/nyregion/trumps-instinct-for-racially-charged-rhetoric-before-his-presidential-bid.html?_r=0"

"‘I don’t worry about anything,’’ Donald J. Trump told me aboard his 757 as we were flying to the recent Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. He was dividing his attention between the brick-size slice of red-velvet cake he was annihilating and the CNN commentator on the 57-inch television who at that moment was talking about Trump, as most commentators have been at pretty much every moment for the last three months. The commentator, Dylan Byers, was saying that Trump now ran the risk of ‘‘jumping the shark’’ because voters were becoming so familiar with his act. ‘‘Nah,’’ Trump said, smirking at the screen. As the real estate and reality-­show tycoon sees things, this is all win-win for him. Peggy Noonan of The Wall Street Journal wrote something to this effect recently, Trump told me, explaining that even if he loses, ‘‘he goes back to being Donald Trump, but even bigger.’’","SEPT. 29, 2015","1533","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/magazine/donald-trump-is-not-going-anywhere.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=677B8A6E4CC69AA20C1C7D2AE6B3A724&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"
"The Trump campaign may be a win-win for Trump, but it is a monstrous dilemma for a lot of other people. It is a dilemma for the Republican Party and a dilemma for the people Trump is running against. They would love to dismiss him as a sideshow and declare his shark jumped, except he keeps dominating the campaign and the conversation, and they have no clue whether to engage, attack, ignore or suck up in response. It is a dilemma for the elected leaders, campaign strategists, credentialed pundits and assorted parasites of the ‘‘establishment.’’ They have a certain set of expectations, unwritten rules and ways of doing things that Trump keeps flouting in the most indelicate of ways. And, of course, it is a dilemma for the media, who fear abetting a circus. This is why The Huffington Post announced in July that it would publish stories about Trump only in its ‘‘entertainment’’ section, so that when it all ended, as it surely would soon, the website could remain pristine and on the side of the high-minded. A similar sort of worry prevented me from writing about Trump throughout his rise this summer. Initially, I dismissed him as a nativist clown, a chief perpetrator of the false notion that President Obama was not born in the United States — the ‘‘birther’’ movement. And I was, of course, way too incredibly serious and high-­minded to ever sully myself by getting so close to Donald Trump.","1534","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/magazine/donald-trump-is-not-going-anywhere.html?_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=677B8A6E4CC69AA20C1C7D2AE6B3A724&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"

But I’ve been paying close attention and it seems to me that of all the problems that face the nation, two stand out.

"The studies I’m talking about were done at Harvard by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren and Lawrence Katz. They looked at the results of a Clinton-era program called Moving to Opportunity, which took poor families and moved them to middle-class neighborhoods. At first the results were disappointing.

This is the third official policy position he has laid out in the three and a half months he’s been running for president.","SEPT. 29, 2015","1589","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"
"His opening salvo, of course, was his absurd proposal to round up the 11 million illegal immigrants living in this country and deport them, en masse, while also building an impenetrable wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “It’ll actually be a wall that will look good,” he actually told Scott Pelley on “60 Minutes” on Sunday night.","1590","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"
"His second position paper, which hasn’t gotten nearly the attention it deserves, is a no-holds-barred defense of the Second Amendment that the National Rifle Association could have written. Among other things, Trump says that we don’t need expanded background checks, and that concealed carry permits — he has one himself, in case you were wondering — should be valid in all 50 states, just like a driver’s license.","1591","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"
"His tax plan, at least, is not completely irrational. Then again, “a broken clock is right twice a day,” as Edward Kleinbard, a law professor and tax expert at the University of Southern California’s Gould School of Law, puts it.","1592","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"
"Kleinbard told me he likes the fact that Trump wants to tax profits that companies earn abroad at the time they are earned, just like domestic profits. That would help end the practice of American companies parking their profits overseas, because they are now taxed only upon repatriation. (Trump also wants to impose a one-time tax on those overseas profits, which would raise some $200 billion.)","1593","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"
"A second tax expert I spoke to, Robert Willens, noted that Trump’s plan would end corporate “inversions,” whereby companies list an overseas “headquarters” to take advantage of another country’s lower tax rate. The reason, though, is that Trump’s proposed 15 percent corporate tax rate is so low that companies wouldn’t need to leave to enjoy drastically lower taxes.","1594","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"
"Trump says his plan will also prevent American companies from moving jobs overseas. But it won’t. Companies might move their headquarters back to the U.S., but the main job sources — factories — will remain in countries that have lower labor costs, not lower taxes. And neither Trump nor anyone else running for president can fix that.","1595","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"
"What is irrational is Trump’s belief that he can cut corporate taxes from 35 to 15 percent, can cut the top income tax rate from 39.6 to 25 percent, can allow millions of additional Americans to go untaxed completely (they’ll be able to fill out a form that says “I win”), can abolish the estate tax and can lower the maximum capital gains tax from 23.8 percent to 20 percent, and still be “revenue neutral.”","1596","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"
"Where will the revenue come from to make up for those tax cuts? It’s not going to come from whacking the “hedge fund guys,” as he likes to call them. Though Trump proposes to end their “carried interest” tax break, his new maximum individual rate of 25 percent means their tax burden would barely budge. And though he claims he will get rid of various unspecified deductions, he didn’t dare touch the one individual deduction that matters: the mortgage interest deduction. Somebody must have told him that that would cost him in the polls.","1597","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"
"Like almost everything else about the Trump campaign, his tax plan is hard to take seriously. (To be fair, most of the tax plans put forth by his Republican rivals are hard to take seriously.) During the “60 Minutes” interview, Trump told Pelley that he would force the Chinese to “do something” about North Korea’s nuclear program — while also preventing them from devaluing their currency! — that he would get rid of Obamacare — while instituting universal coverage! — and that he was on more magazine covers than “almost any supermodel.”","1598","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/joe-nocera-is-donald-trump-serious.html?_r=0"

But, as the younger Mr. Trump wrote in “The Art of the Deal,” nobody was doing that by the 1980s because “it’s not profitable and government subsidies have been eliminated.” So the younger Mr. Trump shifted toward higher-profile projects in Manhattan, which also depended on government assistance in the form of tax abatements.","1851","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/upshot/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-public-sector-deal.html?_r=0"
"His earliest major construction deal in Manhattan was the redevelopment of the Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal, now the glass-covered Grand Hyatt. Mr. Trump sought and won a 40-year property tax abatement (one so long it is still in place today) over the objections of other hotel operators. Before that, he helped persuade the city to build the Jacob K.

"When seeking tax abatements and zoning variances for his private projects, Mr. Trump emphasized how great his developments would be for the city. The tax breaks for the Grand Hyatt, he said, were the only way to stop the existing building from becoming a closed, blighted eyesore. His planned Television City development (a now scrapped proposal to bring NBC to a site on the Hudson River in the West 60s) would bring “business worth at least $500 million a year from new residents.”","1854","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/upshot/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-public-sector-deal.html?_r=0"

"This is more evidence for what some conservatives have been shouting with increasing alarm: Donald Trump is not one of us, does not share a gut-level suspicion of government, is not a true believer in free enterprise.

"That said, while “The Art of the Deal” is not antigovernment in general, it does contain a lot of complaints about specific actions of government. For example, he disliked Ronald Reagan’s 1986 tax reform, which abolished various tax deductions related to real estate. This move, he wrote, “will be a disaster for the country, since it eliminates the incentives to invest and build — particularly in secondary locations, where no building will occur unless there are incentives.” That is, while Mr. Trump is running on a platform of tax simplification today, he was against it 30 years ago.","1857","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/upshot/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-public-sector-deal.html?_r=0"
"Parts of the book presage Mr. Trump’s recent rants about “stupid” politicians. Mayor Ed Koch, he wrote, “has achieved something quite miraculous. He’s presided over an administration that is both pervasively corrupt and totally incompetent.” One chapter is devoted to an almost gleeful description of how the construction of an ice rink in Central Park was botched — they tried to build it on a slope, can you believe that? — and then Mr. Trump took over and got done in six months what the city had failed to do inside six years.","1858","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/upshot/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-public-sector-deal.html?_r=0"
"But these are not so much arguments against government as against stupidity. Cost overruns on the Javits Center could have been avoided, Mr. Trump wrote, if the city had awarded the construction contract to him as he had suggested.

"Twenty-nine years is a long time, and “The Art of the Deal,” which he wrote with Tony Schwartz, who is now a contributor to The New York Times, will not necessarily be Mr. Trump’s blueprint for governing. But in his campaign speeches, Mr. Trump has often echoed the meddlesome approach to business he learned from New York City officials. As president, Mr. Trump likes to say, he’d call up the chief of Ford with a threat: Move your factories back from Mexico or I’ll slap a huge tax on your imports.","1860","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/upshot/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-public-sector-deal.html?_r=0"

"ROCHESTER, N.H. — Expressing confidence that American voters do not care if he lacks specifics, Donald J.

(Additional money for campaign costs has also come from unsolicited donations and online sales of his trademark campaign baseball hats; advisers did not have a total estimate for that revenue.)

"I’ve been working in reality television for 10 years, and I can tell you that Mr. Trump is exactly what we look for in our casting process. He’s uncomplicated and authentic: You can understand his entire personality from a 15-second sound bite. His brand is blunt self-promotion. His buildings are big and gold, shouting TRUMP in all caps. The Donald has absolute confidence even in his most wrongheaded opinions, and doubles down on every mistake, comfortable in the assurance that his wealth provides evidence for his intelligence. He doesn’t need to be good at his job — if he fails, he creates chaos, and chaos makes good TV.","1899","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/donald-trump-our-reality-tv-candidate.html?_r=0"

Gurney Productions found it with the Robertson clan on “Duck Dynasty.” You might watch a thousand casting tapes before you find a character half as watchable as Uncle Si of “Duck Dynasty” or Kim Kardashian or Flavor Flav. I can tell in 30 seconds of a Skype interview if a person is worthy of a show.

"In the various guilty-pleasure/train-wreck formats of reality TV, development execs look for larger-than-life personalities who speak their mind and don’t shy away from conflict.

"A few years ago, I worked on the WE TV series “Bridezillas,” a show that thrived on the conflict between a bride and anyone in her path. This subgenre of reality TV — terrible people behaving badly — works because friction is baked into the format. At the very least, I could usually count on drunken bridesmaids brawling over the tossed bouquet. Political campaigns have their conflict, too, but it’s often too nuanced for a broad audience. Mr. Trump has cut through all that. His ad hominem insults have become his signature move. Even when he professes to be holding back — as when he said of Senator Rand Paul, “I never attacked him on his looks” — he still gets a jab in there somewhere: “Believe me, there is plenty of subject matter.”","1903","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/donald-trump-our-reality-tv-candidate.html?_r=0"
"Donald Trump is the presidential candidate that reality TV made.

"Reality television has always been fixated on the trappings of wealth, from the Real Housewives to the Kardashians and Vanderpumps. In that sense, it’s no different from any popular entertainment, from 19th-century novels to “Dynasty.” We like stories about the rich for a lot of reasons — they live out our aspirations, and their mistakes and foibles shrink the gulf between their lives and ours. In a sense, Mr. Trump’s immersion in the medium of reality TV normalizes his wealth. He connects with an audience for whom he represents the sort of rich guy they would be if they had the money.","1905","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/donald-trump-our-reality-tv-candidate.html?_r=0"
"Even if Mr. Trump’s poll numbers do begin to dwindle as the G.O.P. electorate gets to know him better, he’ll continue to draw an audience.

"Some analysts, like Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, question whether the establishment can exert enough influence over an electorate that seems to despise it. But the party has succeeded in swaying voters even if conservatives have big reservations, as was the case with Mr. McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012.

The 2008 contest was decided on Super Tuesday with big victories by Mr. McCain in California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois.

But the Obama-voting states still possess the delegates necessary to decide the G.O.P. nomination; Republicans in those states are generally more moderate, less religious and better educated than the red-state Republicans. If it came down to it, G.O.P. campaigns and aligned super PACs could easily spend more than $100 million in California, New York, New Jersey and other big, blue and often winner-take-all states in April, May and June of 2016 to knock Mr. Trump out.","1953","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/upshot/donald-trump-vs-the-party-why-hes-still-such-a-long-shot.html?_r=0"

"It would be unfair to blame Mr. Trump alone for the deadness of the Nov. 7 episode. It’s hardly the first time the show has worked with a host who struggled with comedy line readings (some were professional actors). The bigger problem was the anodyne material. Mr. Trump said he hosted the episode to show he could “take a joke,” but “S.N.L.” hardly threw any his way.","2094","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/arts/television/review-donald-trump-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"
"Instead, having chased ratings by casting the controversial candidate, “S.N.L.” stuck with obvious, anemic political riffs and apolitical sketches that were cringeworthy all around. Mr. Trump himself had said that he had vetoed some material he found too risqué (a prerogative of hosts in the past), so maybe he killed better material that we’ll never see. But “S.N.L.,” having cast a boisterous figure whose political raison d’être is “winning,” delivered an episode that did nothing except play not to lose.","2095","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/arts/television/review-donald-trump-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"
"Arguably the most exciting moment of the broadcast came during Mr. Trump’s brief monologue, when Larry David — on set to reprise his role as Senator Bernie Sanders — called out “You’re a racist!” from the wings. It was a clever move to co-opt the $5,000 bounty that protesters had offered to anyone willing to disrupt the live broadcast. But it was a clear setup; Mr. David delivered his lines half-smiling, and Mr. Trump’s prepared response (“As a businessman, I can fully respect that”) fell flat.","2096","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/arts/television/review-donald-trump-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"
"That bit captured the problem with the episode: no one’s heart seemed to be in anything. “S.N.L.” is not obligated to take sides in the election — or not to take sides — but as a topical comedy show, it needs to have some point of view, an animating idea.","2097","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/arts/television/review-donald-trump-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"
"Instead, the show used Mr. Trump, or the idea of Mr. Trump, in predictable ways, as in a sketch he introduced that mocked a limp restaurant gag with mean tweets. His most specifically political bit was the first full-length sketch, which imagined Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in 2018 after having defeated ISIS, gotten Mexico to pay for a border wall and made the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, cry by insulting him.","2098","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/arts/television/review-donald-trump-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"
"In theory, it was a sharp idea: just as Tina Fey lampooned Sarah Palin in 2008 using variations on her own words, the sketch presented Mr. Trump’s own grand, vaguely sketched campaign promises — “You will be bored of winning” — as their own parody. (Asked in the sketch how he had been so successful, he answered, “Well, you know what, I don’t have to get specific. With me, it just works, you know, it’s magic.”) But the segment fell lifeless and mostly laughless on the Oval Office carpet.

"There is, it turns out, something worse than heckling: silence. The crowd seemed to check out early, creating an energy-sucking vicious cycle.

"The “Weekend Update” segment was more pointed, sending up Mr. Trump along with several other candidates.

"But the rest of the episode deployed Mr. Trump in sketches that played like parodies of late-episode “S.N.L.” filler material: he strummed a laser harp in a bar band, walked on to Vanessa Bayer and Cecily Strong’s “Former Porn Stars” endorsement of him, danced like a tax guy in a parody of Drake’s “Hotline Bling” video, played a sleazy record producer pitching demo recordings to amateurs.","2102","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/arts/television/review-donald-trump-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"
"It’s not as if anyone could reasonably expect “S.N.L.” to blisteringly satirize its own host, any more than it did Hillary Rodham Clinton when she guested on a generally charitable sketch earlier this season. Whatever one can say about Donald Trump, he’s shrewd about the TV business. He knows what pressures producers work under, he knows what he can deliver in ratings and he knows the leverage that gives him.","2103","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/arts/television/review-donald-trump-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"
"He’s used all that to his advantage in the campaign. He’s not only availed himself of free media, he’s often set the terms — for instance, phoning into to news shows that usually prefer candidates to sit in person for questioning. He’s even used television savvy as a political point. In the most recent Republican debate, he said that he had pressured CNBC to limit the length of its debate to two hours and cited that as evidence of his skill as a negotiator.","2104","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/arts/television/review-donald-trump-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"
"On a meta level, Mr. Trump probably left “S.N.L.” with another such victory. The episode is not likely to hurt him among any voting group. He can take credit for the high ratings — adding that he delivered for a network that recently had cut ties with him over his comments about Mexican immigrants — and lay any criticism on the writing staff.","2105","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/arts/television/review-donald-trump-on-saturday-night-live.html?_r=0"

"This past week, in an effort to make his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination seem less somnolent, Jeb Bush released an ad attacking Donald J. Trump. Using years-old footage of interviews with Mr. Trump, the ad intends to show us that the Republican presidential campaign’s current front-runner is an ideological phony — an espouser of liberal beliefs who has variously declared himself in favor of abortion rights, single-payer health care and more aggressively taxing the very rich. (This last position is one he hasn’t even tried to conceal, given that as recently as two weeks ago, he appeared on “Face the Nation” arguing that current tax policy left hedge funders “getting away with murder.”)","SEPT. 4, 2015","2108","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/nyregion/donald-trumps-gomorrah-problem.html?_r=0"
"The ad’s overarching accusation, though, is that Mr. Trump is from New York. Within the span of one minute and 21 seconds we are reminded of where he comes from three times, his provenance presumably his greatest sin, New York the incubator of so many fuzzy-headed ideas. “I lived in New York City and Manhattan my whole life, O.K. So my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa,” Mr. Trump is shown declaring both at the beginning of the ad and at the end. In between, he expresses his admiration for Hillary Rodham Clinton. “I live in New York; she lives in New York,” he says, and you know how it is, the implication follows, “if we’re not bumping into each other at Per Se, we’re hugging on a lawn at a Planned Parenthood fund-raiser in Sagaponack.”","2109","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/nyregion/donald-trumps-gomorrah-problem.html?_r=0"
"New York is of course much more of a liability for Mr. Trump than it is for the former secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton, who is a Democrat, is not a native and officially lives in Westchester County. (And perhaps not an issue either for her opponent Bernie Sanders, who, though he hails from Brooklyn, is singularly associated with Vermont — accent notwithstanding.) In the past 115 years, only two presidents are closely associated with New York City, both of them bearing the name Roosevelt. During the 2008 presidential cycle, Rudolph W. Giuliani had an early and considerable lead in the Republican field before failing to secure a single victory in a primary or a caucus. As Tom McCarthy recently put it in a column in The Guardian, by the time voters really started paying attention, they discovered that “Giuliani was a thrice-married, formerly pro-choice, kind of rude person from New York.”","2110","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/nyregion/donald-trumps-gomorrah-problem.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Trump is arguably a more famous thrice-married kind of rude person from New York — reality television and social media have helped him extend the brand — but presidential politics have not typically favored other wealthy if more genteel prospects from New York. In 1964, Nelson A. Rockefeller lost the Republican nomination to Barry Goldwater, the conservative populist from Arizona, in a moment widely considered to have augured the culture wars. Rockefeller, the Eastern establishment candidate, whose bid for the presidency four years earlier resulted in a compromise agreement over the Republican platform known as the Treaty of Fifth Avenue, was perceived as too rich, too urban and therefore too morally dubious.","2111","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/nyregion/donald-trumps-gomorrah-problem.html?_r=0"
"By 1964 his first marriage had ended; he soon married a divorced woman (Margaretta Murphy, or Happy) who drew comparisons to Wallis Simpson. A 1960s documentary about the presidential race, based on the reporter Theodore White’s series of books, “The Making of the President,” has a narrator earnestly intoning the consequences of this action on Rockefeller’s aspirations: “To men and women of dogmatic morality, this appears the manners of Manhattan — Babylon of the East.” (Nearly a century earlier, Samuel J. Tilden, the consummate New York philanthropist and Democrat, was ultimately defeated — though he won the popular vote — by Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, who accused Tilden of, among other things, being a drunken syphilitic. Their battle was the Bush v. Gore of its day.)","2112","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/nyregion/donald-trumps-gomorrah-problem.html?_r=0"
"In the early 1970s, several years after Rockefeller’s defeat, John V. Lindsay, another patrician New Yorker, unsuccessfully sought the presidency; he, too, seemed out of sync. In a 1971 article in The New York Times exploring Lindsay’s chances of securing the Democratic nomination (by then he had abandoned the Republican Party), William James, chairman of Maryland’s State Democratic Committee, offered, correctly, that the candidate would appeal only to “the hard-core urban area” and would “stop there.” Lindsay, he said, “was like a stranger walking in from outer space.”","2113","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/nyregion/donald-trumps-gomorrah-problem.html?_r=0"

More important, it is home to the power base of the conservative movement, claiming Rupert Murdoch and David Koch within its borders. Fox News, is, for the most part, broadcast from Midtown Manhattan, not from a studio in a mythical heartland.

He also offers an “unapologetic yet winsome call” to resist the temptation to forsake grueling crusades, like the fight against abortion, for less controversial causes, like opposing human trafficking. “We’ve chosen to be passionate about issues that have been the least costly to us,” he told me. “Countering culture” means recognizing the ways American Christians have mistaken both material and social comfort for spiritual rewards.","2198","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-and-the-rise-of-the-moral-minority.html?_r=0"
"Who are the heroes of these countercultural warriors? They have assembled a selective genealogy that omits evangelicals who once used the language of martyrdom and resistance to defend white supremacy. They trace their heritage from Paul and the Apostles (contemporary America reminds Dr. Platt of the fleshpots of first-century Corinth, “a city filled with sexual immorality”) to the Christian reformers of the 18th and 19th centuries, especially William Wilberforce, the evangelical politician who helped end slavery in the British Empire.","2199","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-and-the-rise-of-the-moral-minority.html?_r=0"
"“Wilberforce abolished slavery over many years by working with Christians in different industries,” said Gabe Lyons, who runs a conference and media organization called Q, a Christian version of TED (the Q stands for “Question”). “We want to be a counterculture for the common good,” he said. “A counterculture can be antagonistic, lobbing grenades, but that’s not how Christians should be engaging.”","2200","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-and-the-rise-of-the-moral-minority.html?_r=0"
"When these evangelical leaders scan recent history for role models, they choose Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German theologian who died in 1945 at the hands of the Nazis. “A lot of good Germans looked the other way,” said Eric Metaxas, a Christian author who has written popular biographies of both Wilberforce and Bonhoeffer.

"Scholars might raise an eyebrow at comparing the Obama administration’s contraception mandate to the policies of Nazi Germany, but Mr. Metaxas stands by the analogy.

"Conservative evangelicals cherish the word “winsome.” They use it frequently in sermons, books and blogs. (One translation of Colossians 4:6 reads: “Your speech should always be winsome, seasoned with salt.”) It is the key to their political strategy, a signal that they are not the barefoot bumpkins whom H. L.
