"DEMOCRATS WHO have been filibustering the Senate’s consideration of legislation to combat human trafficking cited concerns with language they claimed would greatly expand the reach of Hyde Amendment restrictions on abortion. But when John Cornyn (R-Tex.), chief sponsor of the trafficking bill and Senate majority whip, offered a compromise that would seem to answer their stated objections, it was rejected out of hand. Perhaps Democrats thought they could score political points, or maybe they didn’t want to anger their traditional allies in the abortion rights lobby. Either way, it became depressingly clear that what they weren’t thinking about was the needs of vulnerable people, mostly young women and girls, who are the victims of sex trafficking.","March 20","1","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-new-party-of-no/2015/03/20/bd7ce3ec-cf3f-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"The stalemate over the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 has now occupied two weeks, and with the Senate next set to take up the budget, it’s unclear when — or how — the impasse will be resolved. At issue in the legislation, which had been expected to glide through the Senate with bipartisan support, is a provision — backed by Republicans and initially overlooked by Democrats — that would prohibit a new trafficking-victims compensation fund from being used for abortions save for exceptions covered by the Hyde Amendment. Democrats didn’t like the application of Hyde restrictions to funds that are not taxpayer dollars — the compensation fund was to be drawn from criminal fines — and they objected to the anti-abortion provision being in place for five years.","2","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-new-party-of-no/2015/03/20/bd7ce3ec-cf3f-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"Mr. Cornyn responded by offering to create the compensation fund with an annual congressional appropriation drawing on the fines. Since all such appropriations are already covered by the Hyde Amendment, there would be no change in the political status quo on abortion. “Can they take yes for an answer?” asked Mr. Cornyn on Thursday, contending, “We’ve made a proposal to them to give them what they’ve asked for.” The answer was no.","3","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-new-party-of-no/2015/03/20/bd7ce3ec-cf3f-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"Democrats unfortunately seem to believe that response is in their political interest. Not only are Republicans denied boasting rights for getting something done, but also Democrats don’t risk running afoul of the abortion rights groups that are scoring the vote. The ill-advised decision of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to hold up confirmation of Loretta Lynch, the first African American woman nominated to be attorney general, until the trafficking bill impasse is resolved only gives the Democrats a further motive, as the GOP can be hammered for stalling a highly qualified nominee for a top Cabinet position.","4","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-new-party-of-no/2015/03/20/bd7ce3ec-cf3f-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"There are legitimate concerns about whether the Hyde Amendment’s provisions — it allows abortions only in the cases of rape, incest and danger to the mother’s life — are broad enough to cover young women forced into sexual exploitation. But the question of whether and how congressional appropriations can be used for abortions has long been settled, for better or worse. There is, as we wrote earlier this week, a reasonable way for the two sides to compromise on the trafficking bill, but both sides need to be reasonable. Sadly, that was not the case for Senate Democrats this week.","5","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-new-party-of-no/2015/03/20/bd7ce3ec-cf3f-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"

"House Democrats are gathering in Philadelphia Thursday and Friday to talk about that most compelling and complex of topics: the future. High on that agenda will be how -- and when -- they can hope to retake the majority they lost in the 2010 election.","January 29","41","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"The short answer to that question is: It's going to be a while. The long answer is: It's going to be a while. Here's why.","42","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"Democrats need to net 30 Republican-held seats in order to win the majority. At first glance, that doesn't seem all that tall a task; after all, Democrats won exactly that number in 2006 when they took control of the House.","43","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"But, one major thing happened between the 2006 and 2016 elections. (Okay, LOTS of major things happened, but only one that's super-relevant to this conversation.) Republicans, following a titanic good year for them in 2010, had control of the redistricting process -- the redrawing of the nation's congressional lines -- in a large majority of the states. The result? A Republican-tilting national re-draw that has made it very difficult for Democrats to make the sort of inroads they need to win back the House.","44","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"David Wasserman, the House editor at the Cook Political Report and an absolutely savant with this stuff, has an amazing stat that illustrates what that 2011 redistricting did to the map. He writes:","45","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"The difficulty for Democrats that Wasserman identifies is that simply getting more votes in the two party House splits won't even get Democrats close to the 30-seat pickup they need. The way that the districts are packed and the increasing tendency for like-minded people to cluster together means that Democrats have to win upwards of 55 percent of the overall House vote to come close to claiming a majority of the House seats.","46","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"But, wait, there's more. The 2011 redistricting also strengthened many weak GOP incumbents, making them far more difficult to beat in any year -- even one that tilts toward Democrats nationally. Again, Wasserman: ""In 2010, 42 of the 242 Republicans who prevailed (17 percent) won by a margin of less than 10 percent. In 2012, 30 of the 234 Republicans who won (13 percent) won by less than 10 percent. But in 2014, only 16 of 247 GOP winners (six percent) won by less than 10 points.""","47","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"Looking at Cook's list of incumbents who won with under 55 percent of the vote -- a traditional marker of potential future vulnerability -- in 2014, the slimness of Democratic opportunity is further revealed. In total, 23 Republican members won their seats with 55 percent or less in 2014, but only 13 won with less than 52 percent -- the true sign of future electoral problems. By comparison, 14 Democrats won their races last November by 52 percent or less of the vote.","48","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"But, wait. There's EVEN more. Of the 246 seats that Republicans currently control (they might hold 247 depending on the outcome of the special election to replace New York Rep. Michael Grimm) just 28 were won by President Obama in 2012. That's just 11 percent of their majority. And while it might seem simple for Democrats to add those 28 seats and a few more to win back the majority, many of the Republican incumbents holding Obama districts have shown an ability to win in terrible years. As the New York Times's Nate Cohn has noted, people like Reps. Frank LoBiondo (N.J.) and Dave Reichert (Wash.) have won in very adverse conditions and won't be easily picked off in 2016.","49","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"Now, hope is not all lost for Democrats. A look back at recent elections suggests that Democrats could, theoretically win 55-ish percent of the overall House vote in a presidential election where the national dynamics are extremely good for their side. In 2008, Democrats won 55.54 percent of the national House vote as then-Sen. Barack Obama swept to a massive victory. If Hillary Clinton, the widely-presumed Democratic nominee, won as sweeping a victory in 2016 as Obama did in 2008, it's possible she could carry Democrats into a House majority. Heavy emphasis on possible.","50","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"And there is, of course, the wide and somewhat unpredictable swings in the electorate in between elections these days. Democrats win 30 seats in 2006, Republicans 63 in 2010, and so on and so forth. “There’s no conventional wisdom in politics anymore,” said Rep. Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.) told the Post's Ed O'Keefe. “Would anyone have predicted that [former Republican House majority leader Eric Cantor] would lose his seat? We’re in an environment where anything can happen.”","51","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/29/it-could-be-a-while-before-democrats-are-in-the-house-majority-again/"
"True enough. But rather than rely on the unexpected to happen, Democrats would do well to see their fight to retake the House as a three-election mission. Narrow the Republican majority in 2016. Go absolutely all out at the state legislative and gubernatorial level in 2018 to win in the places where the lines will be drawn in 2021.

"No matter whom Republicans nominate to face Hillary Rodham Clinton in November 2016, that candidate will start at a disadvantage.

"Yes, the somewhat arcane — yet remarkably durable — way in which presidential elections are decided tilts toward Democrats in 2016, as documented by nonpartisan political handicapper Nathan Gonzales in a recent edition of the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report.","55","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"Gonzales notes that if you add up all of the states that are either “safe” for the eventual Democratic nominee or “favor” that nominee, you get 217 electoral votes. (A candidate needs to win 270 to be elected president.) Do the same for states safe or favoring the Republican standard-bearer, per Gonzales’s rankings, and you get just 191 electoral votes.","56","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"That Democratic advantage becomes even more pronounced if you add to the party’s total the states that “lean” Democratic, according to Gonzales. Put Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes), Iowa (6) and Nevada (6) into the Democratic column and the party’s electoral vote count surges to 249 — just 21 votes short of winning a third straight presidential race. (Gonzales doesn’t rate any states as “lean Republican.”)","57","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"Such a scenario is decidedly realistic given that President Obama not only won all three of those “lean” Democratic states in 2008 and 2012 but that he did so by an average of eight points in Iowa and nine points in Nevada. And, the last Republican presidential nominee to carry Pennsylvania was George H.W. Bush, way back in 1988.","58","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"Gonzales’s analysis, which some will dismiss as premature but I applaud (it’s never too early!), reaffirms one of the most important — and undercovered — story lines in presidential politics in the past decade: the increasing Democratic dominance in the electoral college.","59","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"After the near-ties of the 2000 and 2004 elections, Obama ushered in this new era. He won 365 electoral college votes in his sweeping 2008 victory and, perhaps even more surprisingly, 332 electoral votes in the 2012 election, which was regarded by many neutral observers as something close to a tossup going into Election Day.","60","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"This harks back to the sort of upper hand that Republicans enjoyed in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan won 489 electoral votes in 1980 and 525 electoral votes in 1984; Bush followed that up with 426 electoral votes in 1988.","61","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"Democrats are hoping for a similar run in 2016, and there’s some reason to believe it might happen. Of the six states with the largest number of electoral votes (the number of House members plus two for their U.S. senators), only one — Texas (38 electoral votes) — is safely in the Republican column, and California (55), New York (29) and Illinois (20) are all safely Democratic, according to Gonzales.","62","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"Then there is the fact that Democrats have become increasingly dominant among Hispanics, which has turned states such as Nevada, New Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colorado, much more friendly to their side. Consider this: In 2004, George W. Bush won New Mexico over John F. Kerry. About a decade later, neither party spent a dime in the Land of Enchantment, and Obama won it by 10 points. (This trend, if not disrupted by Republicans, will make Arizona and Georgia potentially competitive by the 2020 election.)","63","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"It’s not all gloom and doom for Republicans, though. And that’s because the one thing we definitely know about 2016 is that Obama won’t be on the ballot. That’s a very good development if you are a Republican interested in reclaiming the White House.","64","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"Gonzales writes: “Over the last two presidential elections, Democrats expanded their advantages among some key constituencies, including Hispanic voters and younger voters. But, it’s unclear whether those are data points along a semi-permanent trend toward the Democratic Party or whether the party’s gains are the result of Barack Obama’s unique appeal.”","65","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"Gonzales goes on to note that Obama won big electoral college prizes — Ohio, Florida and Wisconsin — in 2008 and 2012 but that, Obama excepted, there’s little evidence that the states have moved at some elemental level toward Democrats. All three, for example, have Republican governors who are serving second terms and were elected for the first time two years after Obama won the presidency.","66","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"If Florida and Ohio are put into the Republican column — 47 electoral votes between them — then, all of a sudden the GOP nominee is up to 238 electoral votes (if you include all the states that Gonzales ranks as safe or favoring the party.) Put North Carolina and its 15 electoral votes in the GOP column — Gonzales rates the state, which Obama won in 2008 and lost narrowly in 2012, as “tilt Republican” — and the party’s nominee stands at 253 electoral votes, only a hop, skip and a Virginia and New Hampshire away from 270.","67","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-2016-race-an-electoral-college-edge-for-democrats/2015/03/15/855f2792-cb3c-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html"
"In short, Republicans are likely to have more and better options on their map to get to 270 in 2016 than they did against Obama in either 2008 and 2012. But that doesn’t mean the electoral college playing field starts out equal heading into this presidential race. It doesn’t.

"I turned to the political scientist Kenneth Wald, who is the distinguished professor of political science and Samuel R. “Bud” Shorstein Professor of American Jewish Culture & Society at the University of Florida. He is also the author of the newly published article “The Choosing People: The Puzzling Politics of American Jewry.” He graciously responded to some questions via e-mail. Below is a lightly edited version:","120","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"Q: The title of your article refers to the “puzzling politics of American Jewry.” So what is puzzling about their politics?","121","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"In their voting behavior, political identity and attitudes, American Jews are disproportionately clustered on the liberal/Democratic side of the political spectrum. The pattern has held more or less steady since the late 1920s. But we expect most affluent people to favor the party of the right. As a group, even allowing for individual differences, American Jews rank at or near the top on most measures of social class — education, income, occupational prestige and such. That makes their commitment to the Democratic party and liberal values puzzling.","122","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"Q: Your argument discounts explanations that depend on the distinctive aspects of Judaism. For example, you say that it’s not that Jewish values promote liberalism, or that liberals have historically been more accepting of Jews, or that Jews tend to make common cause with other socially marginalized groups on the left, like blacks. What’s wrong with those explanations?","123","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"I criticize what I call “Judaic” theories that emphasize Jewish values, Jewish historical experience, and minority consciousness as the cause of this liberal/Democratic skew among American Jews. I don’t mean to deny that one can interpret Judaism as intrinsically left-liberal or read the historical record to conclude that liberals have historically been supportive of Jewish aspirations, or that having been a stigmatized minority may engender Jewish empathy with other oppressed groups.","124","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"But these explanations don’t help us explain political differences among Jews across countries or over time. American Jews share a religious tradition, historical inheritance, and minority status with most Jewish communities around the globe — and yet only Jews in the United States are concentrated on the left. Jews outside the U.S. are sometimes centrist, sometimes rightist, and occasionally indistinct from the general population, but never as tightly clustered on the left as American Jews.","125","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"And if, as these theories presuppose, liberalism is intrinsic in the Jewish experience, how can we explain short-term fluctuations in American Jewish political behavior? Judaic theories are universal and static, so they cannot account for American Jewish political exceptionalism nor the oscillations in American Jewish voting patterns.","126","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"Q: Your explanation centers on something different: the desire of Jews to defend the separation of religious identity and membership in the state. Where does this desire come from?","127","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"My account of American Jewish political behavior emphasizes the uniqueness of the American context. The U.S. Constitution follows a classic liberal model in separating citizenship and religion. Rather than rooting citizenship in blood or religion, the American system eliminates ethnic particularity as a condition for full membership in the political community.","128","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"This arrangement resonates powerfully with American Jews for practical reasons — it gives them a chance to participate as equals in a way they had not experienced elsewhere — and it differs radically from their historical experience as, at best, a “tolerated” minority whose status often changed on the whims of rulers.","129","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"American Jewish communities in the late 18th centuries celebrated the Constitution’s prohibition on religious tests in Article VI as their Magna Carta. Despite the passage of centuries, they have remained deeply attached to the idea of a secular state, believing that it accounts for their integration in what some have described as the “Kingdom of Kindness.”","130","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"Q: How does this account help us explain why Jews tend to vote for Democrats, and why that tendency is sometimes stronger or weaker?","131","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"Most Jews embrace the classic liberal regime of religion and state in the U.S. and typically support candidates that they perceive as most committed to it. Since the New Deal at least, the Democrats have been that party, but the pattern has occasionally been disrupted. For example, under the influence of identity politics in the late 1960s, Democrats favored policies that seemed to some American Jews to violate the classic liberal idea by granting legal privileges and benefits on the basis of race and gender. In reaction, the Democratic vote share among Jews dropped significantly and oscillated in the 1970s and 1980s.","132","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"When, however, the Republican party reached out to white Protestant evangelicals, who eventually came to constitute the party’s base, Jews reacted negatively because they perceived a threat to the liberal regime. Evangelicals, with their “God talk,” insistence on a “Christian America,” and general willingness to deny fundamental liberties to some minorities on religious grounds, struck many American Jews as a fundamental danger to core values of the polity. Accordingly, Jewish support for Democratic presidential nominees rose from roughly two-thirds to three-fourths in the 1990s and thereafter.","133","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"Even the glaring exception, the Republican-oriented Orthodox Jewish community, manifests similar dynamics. Less concerned with integrating in the manner of most American Jews, some of the Orthodox support Republican candidates who promise policies like tuition tax credits that might facilitate communal integrity. The point is that Jews strategically adapt their political behavior in response to the agendas and rhetoric of the political parties.","134","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"

"Representative King seems to assume that most American Jews are diehard Likudniks, when the evidence runs decidedly in the opposite direction. In fact, much of the estrangement of American Jews from the current Israeli government is rooted in concerns over the growing ethnic and religious nationalism of the right-wing bloc so evident in the Likud’s recent campaign against Israel’s Arab citizens.","136","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"
"For all their commitment to Israel, many American Jews (and Israelis) have long objected to the role of the Israeli state in “establishing” Orthodox Judaism by providing it with generous public funding and quasi-legal authority in matters of personal status. Many activists in the American Jewish diaspora have called on Israel to embrace the classic liberal model, promoting and funding efforts that advance such values as tolerance, democracy and religious pluralism. That really underscores the tenacity of classic liberalism in the political calculus of most American Jews.","137","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/24/why-most-american-jews-vote-for-democrats-explained/"

"It is interesting to watch the Democrats work to fashion “income inequality” into an issue they think they can use. Some Democrats bemoan income inequality as the paramount issue of our time, as if they have been chained, mute, helpless witnesses to policy development for the past six years.

"After all, a Democratic theory of politics — most recently exposed by Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber’s moments of honesty — is to say one thing, do another and count on the voters being too dumb to notice. While the Democrats are lamenting income inequality, they are pushing the very policies that create it. They give lip service to job creation and helping the middle class, but what they really do is increase energy costs, impose punitive regulations on businesses, demand higher labor costs, call for more taxes and make anti-free-market accommodations for labor unions. In the Democrats’ economy, the rich get richer and the poor get more promises — and it is the mega-rich and the very poor who form the bookends of the Democrats’ winning presidential coalition. The middle class is left in an economic dead zone — a zone that used to be populated with jobs in industries that melt steel, gather, consume and fashion raw materials or otherwise produce heat and emissions the Democrats find offensive.","237","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/05/the-insiders-income-inequality-the-issue-the-democrats-want/"
"What exactly is “income inequality”? Well, the U.S. Census Bureau regularly measures it by calculating the “Gini coefficient” for each state. And, as shown in a chart compiled by the New York Times, New York, Connecticut, California and Massachusetts — states where Democrats have an overwhelming advantage in presidential elections — have become increasingly unequal since 1980. In fact, New York and Connecticut actually top the list of the most unequal states, as measured by the Census Bureau, and California and Massachusetts are also in the top 10. Together, these four states had a total of 102 electoral votes in the 2012 elections — all of which went to Barack Obama. It looks like the Democrats’ electoral college base is anchored by the very states where income inequality has exploded under their rule.","238","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/05/the-insiders-income-inequality-the-issue-the-democrats-want/"

"In politics generally and in campaigns specifically, it is important to start from an honest place. Over time, the parties and candidates can drift into a world of their own making, but if they don’t at least start with an honest proposition, they are almost certainly doomed to fail. The Democrats’ attempts to rally their base around the false notion that the Democratic Party is the answer to income inequality should be a non-starter for 2016. If the Democrats can bring themselves to be detached and honest about who they are and what they believe, they might be able to stop themselves before they go too far. The 2016 campaign needs to start with discussions about real challenges and real policy solutions; otherwise, the campaign will just be about personal attacks and phony assertions that don’t address our nation’s problems and that will only continue the deterioration of political participation in America.","240","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/05/the-insiders-income-inequality-the-issue-the-democrats-want/"

A big part of the decline of union density is the decline of manufacturing employment and the rise of non-union service jobs -- at a time when employer opposition to unionization is much stronger than it was in the 1930s and '40s.","382","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/13/to-fix-inequality-democrats-are-pushing-unions/"

"Wonkblog's Chris Ingraham looked at another topline last week: Americans are less likely to live in a household with a gun than at any point in four decades. GSS data is frequently contested, he noted, but other metrics (such as polling from Gallup) reflect that. The Associated Press notes one correlation: The number of Americans who hunt has dropped by half since the late 1970s. At the same time, the number of Americans who live in cities has increased, from 72.7 percent in 1980 to 80.3 percent in 2010.","414","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/10/republicans-are-twice-as-likely-as-democrats-to-live-in-a-household-with-a-gun/"

An important sign of the bill's fortunes will be whether Democrats on the two committees with jurisdiction — the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Energy & Commerce Committee — support the GOP proposal. From what we've seen of the hearings so far, Democrats seem willing to engage.

"Whit Ayres is one of the savviest Republican political strategists around. So, when he speaks, as he did at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Tuesday, I listen — intently. But it was what he didn’t say and couldn’t say during his compelling, hour-long session that stood out.","March 31","437","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/31/what-the-2016-republicans-have-in-common-with-the-1989-democrats/"
"Before I point out what was missing, you need to know what Ayres did say. As he details in his new book, “2016 and Beyond: How Republicans can elect a president in the new America,” demographic changes are wreaking havoc on the GOP’s prospects of winning the White House in the next election. “In every presidential election since 1996 the percentage of whites in the electorate has declined,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons why Republicans have lost five of the last six elections in the popular vote….”","438","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/31/what-the-2016-republicans-have-in-common-with-the-1989-democrats/"
"Turning that around will be a monster task. Ayers said that if the Republican presidential nominee “equals [Mitt] Romney’s 59 percent of the white vote [in the 2012 election], he or she will need to get 30 percent of the nonwhite vote in order to win a majority.” You’ll recall that Romney only snagged 17 percent of the minority vote. To make matters worse, Ayres said this dynamic “requires the nominee to win almost a majority of the Hispanic vote.” A constituency that reelected President Obama in 2012 with 71 percent of its ballots.","439","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/31/what-the-2016-republicans-have-in-common-with-the-1989-democrats/"

"Ayers believes that a Republican can win by being “a transformational candidate who can persuade people who have not voted for a Republican candidate for president in a long time to do so.” Someone who has “the ability to make people take a fresh look at the Republican Party.” When Ayres was asked why the party lost Asian voters (71 percent went for Obama in 2012), he got closer to the problem plaguing the GOP, saying it was “because they have perceived the Republican Party not to be welcoming to nonwhites.” Ayres went on to say, “The transformational candidate I’m talking about will reach out and will say to all Americans, ‘These are our values and if you believe in these values we want you as part of this center-right coalition, regardless of race, creed or color.’”","441","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/31/what-the-2016-republicans-have-in-common-with-the-1989-democrats/"
"Now we get to what Ayres didn’t say. While he made a point of showing how in tone and policy Clinton lurched his party from the left to the center to reclaim the electoral middle, he neglected to provide a concrete example of how his party and its nominee could do the same from the right. When I got to ask him to articulate substantive issues where a Republican candidate could move to the center to be that transformational candidate, he touched on immigration.","442","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/31/what-the-2016-republicans-have-in-common-with-the-1989-democrats/"
"Ayers is referring to Reagan’s famous “Shining City on a Hill” that he talked about in his farewell address in 1989. A “tall, proud city … teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.” And if it were a city with walls and the walls had doors, “the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get there.” That sounds nice. But we’re talking about this “transformational candidate” making it through a primary process that is decidedly less inclusive and accepting.","443","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/31/what-the-2016-republicans-have-in-common-with-the-1989-democrats/"
"Is it possible, I asked in a follow-up, to have that tone of inclusion and acceptance in the primary process? “We’re going to test that proposition, Jonathan.” That Ayres can’t answer the question with confidence shows just how hard it will be for the Republican Party in 2016 to replicate the success of the Democrats in 1992.","444","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/31/what-the-2016-republicans-have-in-common-with-the-1989-democrats/"

"That's assuming people knew what socialism was. Asked to define the term, one-fifth said it referred to government control of the economy. A quarter said they didn't know.

"Just before Christmas, a Post poll revealed the American people’s final verdict. The vast majority agree with the CIA that these techniques were necessary and justified.

"Americans were asked, “Looking ahead, do you feel that torture of suspected terrorists can often be justified, sometimes justified, rarely justified or never justified?” Note that the pollsters used the loaded word “torture” (even though the CIA contends that the techniques did not constitute torture), which should have biased the question in favor of the critics.

"The fact is, in actual practice the techniques were only used “rarely.” Of the tens of thousands of individuals captured since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, only about 30 were subjected to enhanced interrogation of any kind, and just three underwent waterboarding. So “rarely” is the answer that most closely approximates what actually took place.

"That’s not all. While Feinstein was pressing ahead with her politicized investigation, President Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, reopened a criminal investigation of CIA officials involved in the interrogation program. He did this despite the fact that Obama came to office in 2009 pledging to “look forward as opposed to looking backwards” and promising the men and women of the CIA that they would not have to “feel like they’ve got spend their all their time looking over their shoulders.” He did this over the objections of seven former CIA directors, without so much as reading the detailed “declination memos” prepared by career prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia, who had conducted an exhaustive inquiry into allegations of abuse in the CIA program during the George W.

Democratic-leaning outside groups spend millions across the country to register voters, primarily low-income and minority voters who are less likely to sign up through other means. Removing the need to register those voters would ease the strain on liberal groups’ budgets, allowing them to focus more on getting those new voters to return their ballots.","523","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/02/03/democrats-open-new-front-in-voting-wars-in-oregon/"

"The United States’ economic doldrums have been apparent for decades to anyone willing to look. The brief but catastrophic recession of the early 1980s permanently eliminated millions of well-paying manufacturing jobs, chiefly in the Midwest, and few of those displaced workers were able to find work with comparable pay. A gap between productivity gains and average family income — which didn’t exist in the three decades following World War II — opened in the 1970s and has only widened since. The only period during the past 40 years when economic gains registered in workers’ paychecks was the late ’90s, when the economy was close to full employment. But in the current recovery, the marked reduction in unemployment has been accompanied by falling, not rising, wages, with the gains in economic activity going to the wealthiest 10 percent, and most to the wealthiest 1 percent.","528","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-democrats-new-faith/2015/01/22/89fe0470-a26b-11e4-903f-9f2faf7cd9fe_story.html"
"But social reality seldom registers simply because it exists (see: Republicans, climate change). It took the Occupy Wall Street movement, the fast-food strikers, the unions that injected the issue of universal health insurance into the 2008 presidential campaign — in other words, it took activists who dramatized the plight of both the poor and the middle class — to bring to the surface problems that tens of millions of Americans experienced but had yet to hear articulated in our political discourse.","529","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-democrats-new-faith/2015/01/22/89fe0470-a26b-11e4-903f-9f2faf7cd9fe_story.html"

(They should go further and propose reducing tax rates on companies that give their employees wage hikes keyed to increases in productivity and the cost of living.) Last week, the Center for American Progress — a think tank with close ties to Clinton — released a remarkable study, authored by a group co-chaired by former treasury secretary Lawrence Summers, that went beyond the standard diagnosis blaming globalization and technology for workers’ woes. The conduct of U.S. corporations, the authors asserted, is also to blame.","531","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-democrats-new-faith/2015/01/22/89fe0470-a26b-11e4-903f-9f2faf7cd9fe_story.html"

In a world where mobility is always a possibility, they have become less committed to their workforces and their communities.” As remedies, the authors proposed extending profit-sharing to companies’ workers, enacting legislation protecting employees who seek to form unions, and making employers responsible for workers they label as “independent contractors.”","532","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-democrats-new-faith/2015/01/22/89fe0470-a26b-11e4-903f-9f2faf7cd9fe_story.html"
"Democrats have long sought to represent the interests of both business and labor. At times, this has led them into cul-de-sacs of self-negation (something that the president’s simultaneous advocacy of pro-worker tax policies and yet another trade treaty sadly exemplifies). But they seem to be finding a new ideological and political sweet spot: They’re the party that rewards work, that seeks to increase labor income even if — and you’d better believe they’ve polled on this — it means taking a bite out of capital income. Given the weight of money in politics, theirs will be a halting and incomplete conversion, but the signs of their new faith are too numerous to dismiss. Their new emphasis may also help them win back a share of the white working-class voters who have increasingly been electing Republicans.

Here are a few:","538","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/12/yes-conservatives-can-respond-to-democrats-big-new-economic-proposal/"
"Republicans have also proposed direct financial help, although for a smaller portion of the working class. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) wants to make raising children less costly by increasing the child tax credit. Sen.

"There are a couple of complications. The first is that while Democrats have no qualms about proposing major tax increases on investors and wealthy Americans, Republicans do, and they still need a way to replace the money the Treasury loses when the working class pays less in taxes. A tax increase is probably out of the question, but even simplifying the tax code and producing more revenue by eliminating tax breaks would still prove challenging for Republicans, as former Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.) discovered.","540","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/12/yes-conservatives-can-respond-to-democrats-big-new-economic-proposal/"
"Also, even if these tax policies could be paid for, many Republicans still feel strongly that the federal government should not redistribute wealth, and they've argued that Lee's proposal, for example, would redistribute wealth from people without children to parents.

"The United States has more people in prison than any other country.

Prisons are also expensive to maintain, and they'rehampering the economy as a whole. Lee and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), among others, support more leeway for federal judges in handing down sentences, rather than attaching minimum sentences to certain crimes.

"Another idea that Ryan has endorsed is making it easier to work in occupations that currently require a license. You need a license to do all kinds of jobs -- florists, auctioneers and hair-braiders all require licenses in some states. Their work might require special expertise or training, but the license imposes an additional burden of time and money that is arguably superfluous. There are probably many people who are out of work, even though they could make a living in these occupations and would enjoy doing so if only they had a license.","544","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/12/yes-conservatives-can-respond-to-democrats-big-new-economic-proposal/"
"The problem is that almost all of these regulations are imposed by state and local governments, so it would be difficult for a presidential candidate to credibly campaign on reducing occupational licensing. Incidentally, the same is true of prison sentences. Almost all of the country's inmates are in local facilities.

"So, in 1934, Congress began formally delegating some trade negotiating authority to the president.

"This fast-track authority has been granted to every president since Gerald Ford, for limited time windows only, and can be withdrawn whenever Congress fancies. While a speedy, amendment-free vote is what’s technically promised, in practice lots of agreements that had been guaranteed fast-tracking have been altered or delayed before being voted on.

"The key document in the Keystone debate is the State Department voluminous final environmental assessment, released in January of 2014. Both sides like to cherry-pick parts of the report that support their position. For instance, Democrats love to cite the fact that State concluded the pipeline would result in 35 permanent jobs, which is a very minor aspect of the report. But they ignore the bottom line conclusion of the State Department analysis—the environment impact would be minimal because “the proposed project is unlikely to significantly affect the rate of extraction in oil sands areas.”","568","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"

"Even the nomenclature of the material under discussion is in dispute, with the State Department using an industry term, “oil sands,” and foes calling it “tar sands.” Basically it is a hard material known as bitumen, mixed in with sand and clay, which must be extracted, often through open-pit mining, and then refined into crude. (This Pennsylvania State University Web page explains the process; it takes about two tons of oil sands and some barrels of water to yield one barrel of oil.)","571","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"
"That’s difficult work which results in more greenhouse gas emissions than other transportation fuels, on average. The State Department pegged it at 17 percent difference over the life of the fuel (ie, “well-to-wheels”); the Congressional Research Service looked at a range of scientific studies and concluded it was between 14 to 20 percent. (Opponents often cite a much higher figure that looks only at the difference of getting the fuel to the tank.)","572","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"
"Cardin’s staff pointed to news articles and reports by environmental think tanks to make the case that oil sands extraction is harmful to the environment–and that there are potential concerns about the building of the pipeline itself. But the key question before Congress is whether the Keystone pipeline would make a difference in Canada’s extraction of oil sands; the Department concluded it would not.","573","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"
"Indeed, while the pipeline project has been stalled, the Canadian crude increasingly has been shipped by rail. In the second quarter of 2014, crude exports by rail were approximately 163,000 barrels a day, more than 10 times the level in the first quarter of 2012.

"Now, to be fair, the State Department anticipated market conditions of at least $75 a barrel; the price of oil recently dropped below $50 a barrel. Under the State Department calculations, it would cost $10 a barrel to move the crude on the pipeline, compared to $15 per barrel by using tanker cars.","575","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"
"That does not sound like much of a gap, but the State Department said prices below $65 “would challenge the supply costs of many projects, regardless of pipeline constraints, but higher transport costs could further curtail production.” State also said that “higher transportation costs could have a substantial impact on oil sands production levels—possibly in excess of the capacity of the proposed project.”","576","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"
"Those sentences may sound contradictory, but essentially higher transportation costs, when crude prices are below $50 a barrel, would result in oil being left in the ground. But the pipeline would lower transportation costs for the companies that bid for the pipeline space, so some producers would take advantage of that and possibly expand production. Even if production levels remain the same, the industry would consider the pipeline a worthwhile project because it would siphon oil away from more expensive railroads.","577","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"
"It is worth recalling that when the Keystone pipeline was first in its infancy, oil prices were as low as $40 or so a barrel. So one cannot focus too much on gyrations in the oil markets.","578","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"
"The State Department noted that “the dominant drivers of oil sands development are more global than any single infrastructural project” and so “the potential effects of those factors on the industry’s rate of expansion should not be conflated with the more limited effects of individual pipelines.” In other words, the oil industry takes a long view, over 30 to 40 years, and one should not overemphasize the impact of a single project.","579","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"

"We’ve previously fact checked President Obama’s claim that the pipeline was designed to take Canadian crude oil to the world markets. The president earned Three Pinocchios for suggesting that all of the Canadian crude would be exported. First of all, most of the oil would almost certainly stop on the Gulf Coast to be refined into products. On top of that, current trends suggest that only about half of that refined product would be exported.","585","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"

"But the fact remains the reason for the pipeline is because it is taking the crude oil to the refiners on the Gulf Coast, where it would be refined into products such as motor gasoline and diesel fuel. The State Department report disputed claims that the oil “would pass through the United States and be loaded onto vessels for ultimate sale in markets such as Asia,” saying it was not economically justified. The State Department noted that the traditional sources of crude for the Gulf Coast, such as Mexico and Venezuela, are declining, and so refineries would have “significant incentive to obtain heavy crude from the oil sands.”","587","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"
"Obviously, market conditions could change—there are currently about 200,000 barrels a day of unrefined crude exports from the Gulf Coast—but U.S. refineries are now the key destination for the Keystone pipeline.","588","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"

"Oil sands extraction certainly has higher levels of greenhouse emissions than other sources of crude, but the State Department concluded the impact of building the pipeline would be minimal; the material is going to be extracted anyway. Critics of the project say the State Department report is already outdated, given the decrease in oil prices, but the impact on production remains unclear. While the pipeline might offer some cost advantage over rail, if the price of oil keeps dropping, the incentive to mine oil sands will diminish as well.","591","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/08/democratic-claims-on-keystone-xls-impact-on-the-environment-and-oil-exports/"

"Over the weekend, the Democratic National Committee released the preliminary findings of a party autopsy it commissioned in the wake of its major across-the-board losses in the 2014 midterm election.

"This is right on. The reality -- and this is one of the least appreciated stories in politics these days -- is that Democrats have been badly beaten by Republicans at the state and legislative level over the past decade. The election of 2010 was disastrous for many reasons for Democrats but most particularly because it came right before the decennial redrawing of the country's congressional lines. That handed Republicans control of lots and lots of re-draws -- allowing them to cement the majority they won in 2010.

"Cuomo’s speech, given on a July night at the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco, was originally crafted as a response to Ronald Reagan’s frequent and cheery description of the United States as a shining city on a hill.

"The approximately eight-minute speech was also the culmination of the political pitch Cuomo had been honing in the years before, and adhered to his long-held belief that lyrical persuasion was critical to politics, as much as the policies.

"But it was not just well-written phrases that captivated Democrats. It was the fiery way Cuomo took on Reagan, who was riding high in the opinion polls and had frustrated the Democratic ranks with his ability to communicate.

"“President Reagan told us from the very beginning that he believed in a kind of social Darwinism. Survival of the fittest,” Cuomo said that night. “You know, the Republicans called it ‘trickle-down’ when [Herbert] Hoover tried it.

"As noted in “American Voices,” a book on oratory edited by Bernard K. Duffy and Richard Leeman, Cuomo tested out the themes of his 1984 remarks during his 1983 inaugural address as New York governor, where he spoke of the “family of New York, feeling one another’s pain, [and] sharing one another’s blessings.”","622","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cuomos-1984-speech-stirred-democrats-then-and-for-decades/2015/01/01/231fbe1a-922b-11e4-ba53-a477d66580ed_story.html"

"“Do not forget that this entire nation has profited by these progressive principles,” Cuomo said. “They helped lift up generations to the middle class and higher; that they gave us a chance to work, to go to college, to raise a family, to own a house, to be secure in our old age and, before that, to reach heights that our own parents would not have dared dream of.”","625","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cuomos-1984-speech-stirred-democrats-then-and-for-decades/2015/01/01/231fbe1a-922b-11e4-ba53-a477d66580ed_story.html"
"The acclaim from Democrats, inside and outside of the convention hall, was instant and thunderous, and eventually led Cuomo to be touted as one of the party’s leading intellectual lights and potential presidential contenders until he decided against a White House bid in 1992 after much deliberation.","626","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cuomos-1984-speech-stirred-democrats-then-and-for-decades/2015/01/01/231fbe1a-922b-11e4-ba53-a477d66580ed_story.html"

Fifty-one senators -- all Republicans -- voted to move forward with the bill.

"Democrats also dodged a potential electoral nightmare when Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri decided earlier this year not to run for governor in 2016. McCaskill's reelection odds in 2018 are far less certain than Manchin's — she likely would have lost in 2012 had Republicans not nominated Todd Akin — but having her on the ballot gives Democrats a real chance in a state that has moved away from them over the last decade and a half.","656","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/21/why-joe-manchins-decision-to-run-for-senate-reelection-is-a-huge-deal-for-democrats/"

"Why is this poll such good news for Democrats? Because it makes clear that Ohio is very much in play with Strickland as their nominee (the former governor still faces a primary from Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld).

"Rejecting a trade agreement with Asia, expanding entitlement programs that crowd out other priorities and a desire to relitigate the financial crisis are becoming dominant positions among Democrats. Although these subjects may make for good partisan talking points, they do not provide the building blocks for a positive and bold agenda to create jobs and improve the lives of Americans.","973","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-better-agenda-for-democrats/2015/05/28/cfc1c50e-0531-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html"

"First, we should rebuild the United States through a national job-creating infrastructure program that would allow us to invest in transportation, expand our ports and create a new electric grid. Our infrastructure, once the envy of the world, is crumbling before our eyes, hurting Democratic and Republican districts alike. Both parties want to do something about it, but we need a realistic way to pay for it. The answer is bipartisan tax reform that would free up the trillions of dollars of trapped overseas cash and allocate it to investments in the United States. Smart infrastructure investment can create jobs now and into the future, raise overall living standards and improve U.S. competitiveness.","975","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-better-agenda-for-democrats/2015/05/28/cfc1c50e-0531-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html"
"Second, we should create ways for the next generation to access education, which is the ultimate equalizer. The solution is to ask high-income Americans to help pay for it, which I believe they would be happy to do if they knew that 100 percent of the new money would be targeted at proven educational strategies with high levels of accountability. A new focus on universal pre-K and more affordable higher education at results-driven institutions are especially important.","976","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-better-agenda-for-democrats/2015/05/28/cfc1c50e-0531-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html"
"Third, we should take the lead on confronting the existential risk posed by climate change, which, at a minimum, is a clear threat to U.S. prosperity. It’s a big problem that demands an innovative answer. What’s needed is a market-based solution tied to broad tax reform. The free-market U.S. system is uniquely suited to tackle climate change, and we should let it do its work by taxing something we want to discourage — pollution — while reducing taxes on what we want to encourage — businesses that are growing, investing and creating jobs. By leveraging market forces in the service of the planet, we could position the United States to become a global leader in the new energy economy.","977","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-better-agenda-for-democrats/2015/05/28/cfc1c50e-0531-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html"
"Additionally, we need a philosophical shift in the Democratic Party, a new willingness to support programs that create pathways for nongovernmental and philanthropic innovation and investment to help solve the problems of society. We should embrace approaches, such as social impact bonds, that combine private-sector capital and expertise with public-interest goals to produce better government services. Such changes will require Democrats to leave our ideological comfort zone and move away from the idea that government, and government alone, is the answer to our problems.","978","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-better-agenda-for-democrats/2015/05/28/cfc1c50e-0531-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html"
"But instead of being used to voice an agenda that can bring the country together, the party microphone has been hijacked by people more interested in scoring points than in solving problems. They propose expanding Social Security rather than prioritizing serious efforts to preserve the program — even though it will be unable to provide full benefits as soon as 2032, the Congressional Budget Office has made clear. The only way a large-scale expansion could work is by allocating new revenue away from needed investments in the next generation or by shifting the financial burden to workers or our children.","979","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-better-agenda-for-democrats/2015/05/28/cfc1c50e-0531-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html"
"Likewise, as if the global economy will wait for us, protectionists demonize President Obama’s unfinished ­Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. A fair trade deal is a crucial step in bolstering the U.S. manufacturing renaissance, boosting U.S. exports and growing our economy. If done right — something much more likely to happen if the negotiations are directed by this sitting Democratic president — the agreement could create middle-class jobs and allow the United States to set the rules in Asia. Unfortunately, Democratic recalcitrance is increasing the chance that the deal could be done instead by a Republican president.","980","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-better-agenda-for-democrats/2015/05/28/cfc1c50e-0531-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html"
"Lastly, some in our party continue to engage in time-consuming rhetoric attacking banks that has little chance of producing more financial reform and distracts from far more consequential areas of economic risk, such as climate change, chronic underinvestment in the next generation and our broken immigration and housing finance systems.","981","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-better-agenda-for-democrats/2015/05/28/cfc1c50e-0531-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html"
"As Democrats, we should bring forward big ideas to restore broad-based opportunity for all Americans. As progressives, we value fairness, justice and opportunity.

"We’ve gotten so used to Republican infighting over the last few years that it would have been easy to forget that historically it’s the Democrats who have been the most consumed by internecine arguments. Over the weekend we got a reminder, as a group of protesters disrupted a forum at the Netroots Nation gathering of liberal activists where Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley were speaking. By all accounts, neither Sanders nor O’Malley handled it particularly well.","July 20","983","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"But if we look at this event in combination with what’s happening on the Republican side, we can see the stark differences in the relationship of each side’s base, its activists, and its candidates.","984","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"If you want a moment-by-moment account of the event, I’d recommend this one from Eclectablog or Dara Lind’s insightful analysis of the different forces at play. If the protesters wanted to make the point that Sanders in particular is not spending enough time talking about racial injustice, then he did their work for them by reacting in a somewhat combative way and trying to forge ahead with what he wanted to say about economics. But it’s hard to avoid this question: Is Bernie Sanders the guy you want to be protesting? To what end?","985","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"I say that not because Sanders has a strong record on civil rights, though he does. And if the complaint is that Sanders isn’t talking about race as much as he could, well that’s true, too. The truth is that however good his intentions, Bernie Sanders is a longtime Democratic politician who has never really needed the support of the single most important Democratic constituency, African-Americans. He represents the whitest state in the union — only one percent of Vermonters are black. So he may not have the instinctive feel for what African-Americans care about that another politician who had of necessity spent years courting them and working with them would have developed.","986","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"But you know who does have that instinctive feel? Hillary Clinton. She spent her political life in Arkansas and New York, where there are plenty of African-Americans. She’s spent more Sundays in black churches than you can count. Toni Morrison famously called her husband the first black president. Yes, there was plenty of tension and ill feelings when black voters left her and got behind Barack Obama in 2008, but I promise you that they’ll be with her in 2016.","987","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"But Clinton didn’t attend Netroots Nation this year, and Sanders and O’Malley did, so they’re the ones who got protested, for little reason other than the fact that they were handy. And while they suffered some discomfort, one thing the protesters weren’t demanding was that Democrats vote against either one of them in the primaries. In fact, I’m sure that if you asked the protesters what primary voters should do, they’d say that it’s not their real concern — elections aren’t the point.","988","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"Which is where the contrast with Republicans couldn’t be more stark. The Tea Party started just as much as a movement of self-styled outsiders, but unlike activists on the left, they pursued an inside strategy from the outset, one focused clearly on elections. They saw the path to achieving their goals running through Congress and the White House, and they all but took over their party by mounting successful primary challenges to Republican incumbents. How many prominent Democratic incumbents have faced the same kind of strong grassroots challenge from the left in recent years? There was Joe Lieberman, who was beaten in the 2006 Democratic primary in Connecticut by Ned Lamont. But apart from a backbench House member here and there, that’s about it.","989","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"In contrast, Republican activists have gotten one prominent scalp after another, from incumbent senators like Richard Lugar and Bob Bennett to important House members like Eric Cantor. The result is that Republican politicians regard their base with barely-disguised terror. You can see it in how they’ve approached Donald Trump, a spectacular buffoon who has tied the party in knots. Even when he was saying one bigoted thing after another about the demographic group the party desperately needs if it’s ever to win back the White House, his opponents stepped gingerly around him, lest they offend his supporters. It was only after Trump’s remarks about John McCain’s war record (which, frankly, he sort of got baited into making) gave them an excuse removed from any policy area that most of them finally started criticizing him.","990","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"Even if Trump pulled out of the race tomorrow (sorry, Republicans, no such luck), the rest of the candidates would still operate from fear of their base, which means that activist conservatives will be able to extract commitments from the candidates on the issues that they care about. You can argue that in the long run this hurts the GOP by radicalizing the party and making its presidential candidates unelectable, and you’d probably be right, but in the short run, it probably feels to those conservative activists like success.","991","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"The situation on the Democratic side isn’t the same at all. The activists involved in Black Lives Matter and similar efforts would say that they don’t want just to become players in the Democratic Party, because they’re looking to create change on entrenched issues with roots that go back centuries. And they might be right that an outside strategy will be more effective at achieving that change than a strategy focused on making gains within the party. After all, you can argue that while tea partiers have almost taken over the GOP, they’ve gotten very little of the substantive change they wanted — the Affordable Care Act lives, Barack Obama got reelected, and history keeps marching forward despite their efforts, even if they’ve managed to stop things like comprehensive immigration reform.","992","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"
"On the other hand, circumstances will eventually produce another Republican president, even if it isn’t next year or four years after that. And when that president gets elected, the conservative activists will come to collect on the commitments he made.","993","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/20/republicans-fear-their-activist-base-democrats-dont/"

"Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, said he recognizes the challenges ahead for him — including broadening his support among African American voters, who will be crucial in states such as South Carolina.

"The announcement of a historic deal with Iran curbing that country’s nuclear program makes it more likely that the 2016 election will be fought, at least partly, around a broad argument over the proper extent of U.S. international engagement as a means to solve the biggest future challenges we face.","July 14","1030","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/14/morning-plum-dont-fear-the-iran-debate-democrats/"
"It also means the presidential contenders will take sides around what has been called the Obama Doctrine: The idea that we should accept the limits of American power to enable us to solve these challenges on our own, even if that entails engaging internationally in ways that carry risks in their own right.","1031","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/14/morning-plum-dont-fear-the-iran-debate-democrats/"
"The details of the deal are listed right here. Congressional Republicans have already condemned it, while some key Senate Democrats — such as Tim Kaine of Virginia — are saying generally positive things while reserving judgment on the details. But the consensus this morning is that it will be very hard for Congress to block the deal from moving forward, at least in the short term. Because of the way Congress has structured its oversight mechanism, even if Congress disapproves of it, President Obama only needs just over one-third of one chamber to stick with his veto of that disapproval, which is very likely to happen.","1032","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/14/morning-plum-dont-fear-the-iran-debate-democrats/"
"Some of the major GOP presidential candidates — such as Scott Walker and Marco Rubio — have already pledged to undo an agreement with Iran, and crucially, they have said they will do so regardless of whether our allies want that deal to continue. Jeb Bush also condemned the previous framework.","1033","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/14/morning-plum-dont-fear-the-iran-debate-democrats/"
"By contrast, Hillary Clinton is likely to support the deal, though it remains to be seen how much hedging she’ll do along the way. Michael Crowley has a useful look at Clinton’s public statements on Iran, noting that she’s generally more hawkish than Obama but that she’s ultimately supportive of his diplomacy.","1034","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/14/morning-plum-dont-fear-the-iran-debate-democrats/"
"Thus, the argument that develops around the agreement may also take shape around the virtues and risks of international engagement. And this could join other issues to feed into a broader contrast, in which Republicans are opposing international engagement on multiple fronts — including Cuba and climate change (on which we may have an accord later this year). Meanwhile, Clinton may well embrace international engagement on multiple fronts, and use this contrast to cast the GOP as too inward looking and trapped in the past to confront the challenges of the future.","1035","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/14/morning-plum-dont-fear-the-iran-debate-democrats/"
"Peter Beinart argues provocatively that GOP opposition to the Iran deal is premised on a refusal to acknowledge the limits of American power. This puts Republicans in the position of opposing the deal mainly because there are risks associated with it, without offering any credible alternative. Obama described his international approach in similar terms in a recent interview with Thomas Friedman, who characterized the president’s position this way: America’s power may not be limitless, but it remains overwhelming, and the U.S. thus “needs to have the self-confidence to take some calculated risks to open important new possibilities.”","1036","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/14/morning-plum-dont-fear-the-iran-debate-democrats/"
"This doctrine also applies to engagement with Cuba and to an international climate accord (we don’t know whether other countries will keep up their end of the bargain). Beinart also suggests that the American mainstream may be more sympathetic to this worldview than pundits (who tend to give the Republican position the benefit of the doubt in such situations) think. I agree. While it’s hard to predict how the specifics of the Iran deal will play politically, Democrats should not fear this broader contrast. They should lean into it.","1037","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/14/morning-plum-dont-fear-the-iran-debate-democrats/"

"Seven years of President Obama’s ad hominem attacks have degraded the country’s political debate. He insults liberal opponents of the trade deal, accusing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as he does with Republicans, of base political motives. “The truth of the matter is that Elizabeth is, you know, a politician like everybody else. And you know, she’s got a voice that she wants to get out there. And I understand that. And on most issues, she and I deeply agree. On this one, though, her arguments don’t stand the test of fact and scrutiny.” Obama’s spokesman kept up the drumbeat, insisting that Democrats didn’t know what they were talking about and insinuating that Warren was motivated by politics, not facts.","1154","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/05/13/democrats-embarrass-themselves-on-trade/"
"An irate Democratic operative writes: “Obama’s current contempt for liberals on trade reinforces a trend that leads to the worst election results for Democrats. For Obama to fire insults against liberals at Nike last Friday only adds insult to insult to injury. Nike is one of the companies most associated with exporting American jobs abroad to low-wage nations that often have abusive practices against workers. Is the president who says liberals don’t know what they are talking about on trade intellectually unaware of this, or callously insensitive to this, or so contemptuous of liberals he simply does not care?” Well, conservatives feel their pain, having been accused of rooting for “dirtier air, dirtier water, less people with health insurance,” war, the end of Social Security as we know it and “Social Darwinism.” Obama claims they put party above country. Anyone who disagrees with him, in his eyes, is guilty of bad faith or ignorance.","1155","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/05/13/democrats-embarrass-themselves-on-trade/"
"Stung by the accusations he usually hurls at conservatives, liberal Democrats cry sexism. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) jumped to Warren’s defense: “I think by just calling her ‘another politician. I’m not going to get into more details. I think referring to her as first name, when he might not have done that for a male senator, perhaps?” And pretty soon the National Organization for Women was piling on. (“I think the president was trying to build up his own trustworthiness on this issue by convincing us that Senator Warren’s concerns are not to be taken seriously. But he did it in a sexist way. . . . [The] clear subtext is that the little lady just doesn’t know what she’s talking about.”) Is the “war on women” being waged by the White House, or have Democrats become so accustomed to demonizing their opponents that they can’t engage in civil debates even among themselves? It does not speak well of the Democrats’ ability to persuade and lead. But it does portend a nonstop stream of gender bias claims in the 2016 presidential election.","1156","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/05/13/democrats-embarrass-themselves-on-trade/"
"On the substance, the Democrats have become the small-minded party of anti-free trade and retrenchment. Ironically, the part that lauds “soft power” is willing to undermine a major part of the soft power equation. As David Adesnik writes: “The benefits of [the Trans-Pacific Partnership] extend beyond economic opportunities. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter recently said that ‘TPP is as important to me as another aircraft carrier.’ This is because Carter understands that the agreement is essential to the U.S. ‘rebalance’ toward Asia. Especially as shrinking defense budgets weaken the military component of the rebalance, TPP has become an even greater priority for policymakers.”","1157","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/05/13/democrats-embarrass-themselves-on-trade/"

"The case for Dem optimism has been fortified by Donald Trump, who in recent days has been spraying inflammatory quotes about immigrants around like a garden sprinkler. It’s true that a number of GOP candidates have condemned his remarks. But as Michael Gerson details, Republicans still appear locked in a debate over the fundamental underlying question of whether their route to the White House lies in pumping up the white vote in the Rust Belt (a strategy perhaps foreshadowed by Scott Walker’s move to the right on immigration) or in broadening their appeal beyond their demographic comfort zone (a strategy that Jeb Bush has urged on the party).","1162","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/07/how-durable-is-the-democratic-advantage-among-latinos/"
"An additional reason for Dem optimism: Some Republicans are reportedly skeptical that the party should bother focusing its energy on nominating a candidate who might appeal to Latinos, on the grounds that those voters agree with Democrats on many issues, so being pro-immigration reform (as Jeb is) won’t be enough anyway.","1163","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/07/how-durable-is-the-democratic-advantage-among-latinos/"

"Simon Rosenberg, the president of the NDN think tank, floats the possibility of a GOP ticket that includes Bush and Nevada governor Brian Sandoval as vice president. Sandoval won a third of the Latino vote in his 2010 race, despite striking a hard-ish line on immigration, from which he has since backed off. Sandoval is relatively young. A Bush-Sandoval ticket would be led by a man with a Mexican wife and Latino-American children, and backed up by a man of Mexican descent — representing a bet that the GOP can contest Florida and western states with large Latino populations by improving its cultural appeal among those voters. Remember, Republicans only need to marginally reduce their historically large 2012 deficit among Latinos to improve their chances in such states.","1165","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/07/how-durable-is-the-democratic-advantage-among-latinos/"
"So Rosenberg thinks Dems should invest more now in using the Trump outbursts to do more damage to the GOP brand among Latinos, as a kind of insurance policy against outcomes such as a Bush-Sandoval ticket. Rosenberg emails me:","1166","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/07/how-durable-is-the-democratic-advantage-among-latinos/"
"To be sure, there are big differences between the current moment and the run-up to the 2000 election. Dems are far more united behind immigration reform today than in the late 1990s, reflecting a changing Democratic Party increasingly reliant on Latinos. Buzzfeed reports that the Hillary Clinton campaign is developing a very comprehensive and aggressive plan for national Latino outreach. She has already pledged to go farther than Obama did on his executive actions on deportations. And today she renewed her support for comprehensive reform and attacked the GOP as backward on the issue. All of these things are signs of Clinton’s commitment to the party’s new demographic realities.","1167","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/07/how-durable-is-the-democratic-advantage-among-latinos/"
"Meanwhile, House Republicans have steadily moved rightward on immigration, passing on a historic chance to act on the Senate reform bill and voting repeatedly to roll back Obama’s deportation actions. That has many Dems confident — to a point.","1168","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/07/how-durable-is-the-democratic-advantage-among-latinos/"
"“The damage may be too great to the GOP brand,” one senior aide to a prominent Latino House Democrat says. “It may take more than Bush-Sandoval to rehabilitate this huge mistake Republicans have been making.

"So, yes, perhaps Republicans have moved so far to the right on immigration that the party can’t conceivably re-run the 2000 Bush immigration strategy, or perhaps even reconstituting that strategy wouldn’t be enough to reverse GOP losses among Latinos at this point.

As Politico notes, many other countries are advocating for far lower ones, which means it could end up being around seven years, not twelve. But with the pharmaceutical industry — backed by some Democrats — advocating for the 12 year threshold, and other Dems lining up against it, this may flare up into a major firefight before long.","1245","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/a-big-battle-looms-among-democrats-over-big-pharma/"

"UPDATE: A quick point of clarification: Sherrod Brown opposes this provision because it could lock in the threshold at 12 years, which could be an obstacle to any future legislative efforts here to bring down the threshold in U.S. law from its current 12-year level. Meanwhile, health groups (and Brown and plenty of other Democrats) oppose the 12-year threshold because it could lock that in for other participating countries.","1247","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/05/a-big-battle-looms-among-democrats-over-big-pharma/"

"As the buzz about Vice President Joe Biden mulling a presidential race takes flight, those sympathetic to his run float a one-term trial balloon. It’s smart on many levels and solves several problems both for Biden and the Democratic Party, the latter which is reeling from the FBI inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s e-mail and her declining poll numbers.","August 17","1249","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/could-a-one-term-biden-presidency-rescue-the-democrats/"
"The latest Fox News poll shows Hillary Clinton dropping to 49 percent, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) up to 30 percent. The 19-point gap between the two is down from 46 percent at the end of June. More worrisome, in general election match-ups Clinton now trails Jeb Bush (44 to 42 percent) and Sen. Marco Rubio (46 to 44 percent). Some 58 percent believe she lied about her e-mails, only 2 percent think she told the truth and 33 percent think there is some other explanation. By a 54 to 37 percent margin, respondents think she jeopardized national security.","1250","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/could-a-one-term-biden-presidency-rescue-the-democrats/"
"In short, it is increasingly possible she will fall beyond Sanders nationally. If she limps through the primary, she would be vulnerable to multiple GOP contenders. Put differently, Democrats no longer have the luxury of denial. They need to have a backup plan. Hence, the “Biden as a one-termer” plan emerges.","1251","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/could-a-one-term-biden-presidency-rescue-the-democrats/"
"The most obvious purpose of a one-term plan is as a preemptive response to the age issue. The Post observed, “Biden is 72 years old and would be 78 upon completing his first term. That’s five years older than the oldest president to be sworn in for a second term — Ronald Reagan, at 73. Which, we’ll note, is how old Hillary Clinton would be at her second inauguration.” But then age seems not such a big concern for Democrats. (Sanders is 73.)","1252","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/could-a-one-term-biden-presidency-rescue-the-democrats/"
"More important, however, is the appeal to the cadre of not-yet-ready presidential candidates who would rather not wait eight years to take their shot. With Clinton or a GOP winner, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and other aspirants get the benefit of a few years of preparation and maybe a shot at the VP spot. They therefore have less reason to oppose a Biden run, even if they are nominal Clinton supporters.","1253","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/could-a-one-term-biden-presidency-rescue-the-democrats/"
"And finally, Biden positions himself as the quintessential pinch hitter. If Clinton goes down swinging due to scandal or a plain-old lack of likability, Biden is there — an experienced hand with national name recognition who is simply doing the party a favor.","1254","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/could-a-one-term-biden-presidency-rescue-the-democrats/"
"As stale and lacking in political skills as Clinton may be, we would not be here if not for the e-mail debacle. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” put responsibility directly with her “for having her own personal server, for exclusively using private email, for telling us the Sidney Blumenthal emails were unsolicited and then we later find out that they were not. For telling us there was no classified information and we later find out that there was. For telling us the public record was complete and then we find 15 emails she never turned over to the State Department.” As he put it, “Sometimes when people are frustrated they look in the mirror and engage in a little bit of self-reflection and then sometimes they lash out and blame nonexistent right-wing conspiracies, and apparently she’s chosen to do the latter.”","1255","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/could-a-one-term-biden-presidency-rescue-the-democrats/"
"No matter who one believes is responsible for her current travails, Clinton is a seriously damaged candidate. We wouldn’t have the prospect of a gaffe-plagued, aging VP running to become an automatic lame duck if she weren’t. And given the choice between scandal-scarred Clinton and a loyal VP, Democrats would be foolish to reject the hand Biden seems prepared to offer his party.","1256","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/08/17/could-a-one-term-biden-presidency-rescue-the-democrats/"

"The Black Lives Matter movement appears to be louder and more pointed, but is perhaps even more aimless than Occupy. In fact, the Black Lives Matter protesters have contorted their message into a political statement meant to intimidate politicians from even acknowledging that “all lives matter.” Democratic presidential candidate and former Governor Martin O’Malley actually felt he had to issue an apology for saying “all lives matter” when he was confronted by Black Lives Matter protesters at the Netroots Nation Conference earlier this August. Then, at a rally for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Seattle just a few days ago, Black Lives Matter protesters actually took the microphone from Sanders to make demands that weren’t really clear. It was disruption for the sake of disruption. What’s Bernie Sanders supposed to do? And Hillary Clinton, in true form, held a closed-door meeting with some of the Black Lives Matter protesters who tried to crash one of her events earlier this week. It’s toe-curling to watch her try to be an invisible candidate while running for president of the United States.","1463","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/12/the-insiders-the-black-lives-matter-movement-is-bad-for-democrats/"
"Anyway, if Black Lives Matter protesters are already disrupting Democratic candidates for president in their appearances across the country, it’s only a matter of time before they show up at GOP events. Republicans should not take the bait. The Black Lives Matter movement is misguided, much like Occupy Wall Street. Their dishonest, anti-police views belong exclusively in the Democratic Party. Gasp! Yes, I said it. I won’t pretend their movement is anything more. Anyone who contorts their politics in a way that brings us to a state where saying “all lives matter” is wrong can no longer be considered legitimate. They are aggravating racial divisions rather than promoting coherent solutions and they have moved beyond the harmless, eye-rolling political correctness that permeates America’s liberal politics.","1464","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/12/the-insiders-the-black-lives-matter-movement-is-bad-for-democrats/"

"The more interesting question is whether Democrats’ stronger support for the ACA has led them to sign up for health insurance at faster rates than Republicans who remain overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare. While establishing the causal influence of partisanship on health insurance coverage is difficult, there are strong reasons to believe that Americans’ partisan attachments have played an important part in their Obamacare enrollments.","1541","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/16/more-democrats-are-getting-health-insurance-thanks-to-obamacare-why-are-republicans-staying-away/"
"For starters, party identification was a powerful determinant of whether uninsured Americans planned to purchase health care insurance or pay the ACA’s fine down the road for failing to do so. According to Gallup surveys of nearly 4,000 uninsured adults in the last quarter of 2013, Republicans were three times more likely than Democrats to say they would remain uninsured and pay the fine (45 percent to 15 percent respectively).","1542","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/16/more-democrats-are-getting-health-insurance-thanks-to-obamacare-why-are-republicans-staying-away/"
"Second, I examined data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) and the Kaiser Foundation’s monthly Health Tracking Surveys, which together asked over 200,000 respondents if they had health insurance between 2010 and 2014. After controlling for several demographic factors in those two large surveys—e.g., age, race, ethnicity, gender, income, marital status, education, and state of residence—Democrats’ uninsured rates still fell significantly faster than Republican rates did after Obamacare took effect.","1543","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/16/more-democrats-are-getting-health-insurance-thanks-to-obamacare-why-are-republicans-staying-away/"
"Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to buy their own insurance from health care exchanges created by the ACA–so much so that partisanship was the strongest predictor of purchasing health insurance from a state or federal exchange in the 2014 CCES survey. Even after controlling for the aforementioned demographics, the figure below shows that strong Democrats were twice as likely as strong Republicans to buy their insurance from a health care exchange.","1544","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/16/more-democrats-are-getting-health-insurance-thanks-to-obamacare-why-are-republicans-staying-away/"
"Finally, and perhaps most important, party identification was a highly significant predictor of individual-level changes in health insurance status from 2012 to 2014. The final figure below graphically displays those results from the 2012-2014 CCES Panel Study—a survey that re-interviewed over 900 individuals in 2014 who did not have health insurance when they were surveyed back in 2012. That display shows that strong Democrats who did not have health insurance in 2012 were nearly 20 percentage points more likely to be insured in 2014 than their strong Republican counterparts (after controlling for several demographic factors).","1545","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/16/more-democrats-are-getting-health-insurance-thanks-to-obamacare-why-are-republicans-staying-away/"
"Taken together, the results suggest that Republican opposition to the ACA has spilled over into enrolling for Obamacare.

"Given many Democrats simply don't know Sanders, the difference in views of him by subgroup are not gigantic. But lagging support from these groups could prove troublesome. Moderate and conservatives accounted for an average 53 percent of Democratic primary voters in 2008 across all states with exit polls, and non-college graduates accounted for 54 percent of the electorate.

"That's how many Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in a new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll said they could see themselves supporting Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination in 2016, a stark sign of how little genuine resistance there is within the party to the idea of the former secretary of state as the nominee.","1619","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/23/theres-a-new-poll-number-that-shows-just-how-likely-hillary-clinton-is-to-be-the-democratic-nominee/"
"In fact, support for Clinton on that question has risen since NBC-WSJ last asked it in March, even as Bernie Sanders appears to be picking up momentum in his primary challenge to Clinton.

"How then to reconcile that 92 percent number with the fact that six in 10 (62 percent) of those same Democrats said they prefer a ""challenging primary"" over an ""easy"" one for Clinton? A couple of ways: (1) Human nature makes us like some level of competition. We like the idea that no one gets anything without hard work. (2) There is a desire to see Clinton tested in some way to prove that she is ready for what Republicans are going to throw at her.

"The way that someone who is as big a favorite as Clinton loses a party nomination (or comes close to losing one) is a failure to understand that a significant pocket of discontent — ideological, generally — exists and is in search of a candidate.

"Black people in the United States continue to be sicker and die sooner than whites. These health inequalities have persisted even though they are contrary to what some policymakers anticipated in the post-civil rights era, when blacks gained greater access to health services, employment opportunities and other determinants of health. Because blacks lag behind whites in infant mortality, life expectancy and a wide variety of morbidity rates, they suffer from “excess mortality” — that is, black deaths that would not have occurred had the death rate among blacks been the same as that among whites.","May 10","1627","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"But what are the political consequences of excess mortality among blacks? A new article by Javier Rodriguez, Arline Geronimus, John Bound and Danny Dorling — “Black lives matter: Differential mortality and the racial composition of the U.S. electorate, 1970-2004” — answers this question. It finds that excess mortality among blacks reduces their voting power significantly, perhaps costing Democratic candidates several elections.","1628","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"Rodriguez and colleagues estimate that excess deaths among blacks totaled 2.7 million between 1970 and 2004, that 1.74 million would have been of voting age, and that 1 million would have voted in the 2004 election. Combining excess mortality with the consequences of felon disenfranchisement, they find that about 1 in 7 blacks (15 percent) did not have the opportunity to vote in 2004 for one of these two reasons.","1629","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"In that election, 166 presidential electoral votes (62 percent of the 270 needed to win) were contested in states where at least 15 percent of voting-age blacks did not participate because of premature death or felony disenfranchisement. Nevertheless, even though the authors calculate that John Kerry would have won 86.6 percent of the black votes lost to excess mortality, these deaths were not enough to have changed the outcome of the presidential race.","1630","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"But in down-ballot races, the story is different. The authors estimate that between 1970 and 2004, Democrats would have won seven Senate elections and 11 gubernatorial elections were it not for excess mortality among blacks.","1631","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"All of these numbers could actually be underestimates. Given limitations in data availability, the authors could calculate excess mortality only over the 1970-2004 period and, thereby, could not count deaths that would have accrued among earlier cohorts.","1632","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"The authors’ data also are not perfect in other respects. Their calculations of excess mortality could not take into account socioeconomic status, for example, because health records in the United States often do not contain information about income and education.","1633","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"There is also the broader challenge of identifying a counterfactual — that is, what would have happened had these additional blacks been eligible to vote? Answering this question depends on assumptions, such as those necessary to estimate how these blacks would have voted. Of course, we cannot know how the strategies of parties or candidates would have changed had these additional black voters been in the electorate.","1634","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"Nevertheless, the article demonstrates that black people are dying much sooner than whites, on average, and that this fact may affect the outcomes of elections. It is crucial to be clear about the first point to fully appreciate the second. Research has shown that blacks are not dying in excess because of differences in genetic endowment or health behavior. Instead, health disparities reflect racial and class inequality and an accumulation of stressors, including segregation, discrimination, exposure to pollution and unequal access to health-care resources, to name a few.","1635","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"These social determinants of health depend to a great extent on politics. Thus, the harsher physical and social environment that blacks face is the direct and indirect result of political decisions, past and present.","1636","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"Ultimately, the authors point out a troubling feedback effect whereby premature deaths among blacks affect the balance of political power among blacks and whites in the United States. And given the differences between blacks and whites in their political agendas and policy views, excess black death rates weaken overall support for policies — such as antipoverty programs, public education and job training — that affect the social status (and, therefore, health status) of blacks and many non-blacks, too.","1637","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/10/blacks-die-sooner-than-whites-how-many-votes-has-this-cost-democrats/"
"The tragic deaths of unarmed black men have again generated conversations about racial inequality in the United States. This paper shows us another way in which “black lives matter” — one that affects a key element of our representative democracy: the composition of the electorate.

"It's up for debate whether Democrats can take the credit for their record on economic performance. Blinder and Watson note that Democrats have benefited from overall lower oil prices. Increases in productivity — which more or less reflects the speed of technological progress — were greater under Democrats. And more Democrats have served as commander in chief during wartime.

"Maybe the pending King v. Burwell decision will finally put Obamacare out of its misery. No matter what President Obama or Health and Human Services secretary Sylvia Burwell say, the truth is Obamacare is just limping along as another misguided, over-priced and underperforming government program. In practice, it’s not doing anything like what was promised. Like other big government programs, Obamacare is slowly building a constituency as more people succumb to the coerced dependency Democrats see as vital to their political strength.

"If the Supreme Court rules against the subsidies and the Democrats were smart, they would secretly admit Obamacare is a failure, blame Republicans and take it as an opportunity to quickly dispatch with their grandiose notions of a single-payer system as part of a government takeover of healthcare. Just a few Democrats could quietly join with Republicans to provide vouchers for the uninsured and make a few other relatively modest fixes, plus keep parts of the law that people like, and take credit for turning healthcare in America into a market-driven success instead of a government-managed failure. And while they do it, most Democrats could continue to demagogue on the issue from the safety of their minority position in Congress.","1667","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/06/11/the-supreme-court-would-help-democrats-by-killing-obamacare/"
"One of the smartest long-term Republican plans to replace Obamacare is from Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a former physician. His plan would allow states to “opt out of Obamacare mandates and instead receive tax credits for health savings accounts,” relying on incentives for individuals to buy health insurance coverage. ‎His Patient Freedom Act is already backed by a number of Senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and is a solid conservative plan in the event that the court rules against the Obama administration later this month.","1668","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/06/11/the-supreme-court-would-help-democrats-by-killing-obamacare/"

Of course, if the president gets his way, the court will rule in his favor and this will be a moot point for the time being.

"The Obama administration is a case study in mismanagement. Republican presidential candidates should remind voters that management matters. And it isn’t just about government process.

"The failure to produce “shovel-ready” projects, the IRS targeting malfeasance, the calamity of the Obamacare roll-out, the bungling of the Fast and Furious operation, the mass confusion surrounding the enforcement of America’s southern border, the Veterans Affairs neglect, the lack of transparency in the White House, the bewildering events surrounding the Secret Service, the oblivious Office of Personnel Management, the tolerance of “sanctuary cities” that may have directly led to the death of an innocent American citizen and, now, a revelation that accused Charleston, S.C., shooter Dylann Roof was able to purchase a gun that he otherwise should not have been able to buy because there was a “lapse” in the FBI background check system.

They perceive the most critical threats as Iran’s nuclear program (75 percent) and Islamic fundamentalism (72 percent). Democratic opinion leaders surveyed see climate change as the top threat (79 percent) and limiting climate change (84 percent) their top goal.

"Taken together, it’s clear that the Republican elite have a greater tolerance for sending troops and drones abroad, as well as arms to Syrian anti-government groups. GOP candidates are already appealing to their base with the philosophy of “might is right.” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) emphasized the importance of continued military strength in a May 13 speech at the Council on Foreign Relation: “When America has the mightiest Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and intelligence community in the world, the result is more peace, not more conflict.” And in an interview with Fox News last month, former governor and expected GOP candidate Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) went on the offensive, stating that, “And the narrative that the left wants to bring which is either you’re for this nuanced view of pulling back and they were leading from behind and that we’re part of the community of nations and blah, blah, blah, that if you don’t believe that, you’re a warmonger, I just reject that out of hand.”","1736","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/08/are-republicans-or-democrats-closer-to-general-american-public-opinion-on-the-middle-east/"
"While these statements might sit well with Republican influentials, they do not dovetail quite so neatly with American public opinion. For the most part, Americans lean toward staying out of conflicts abroad (aside from anti-terrorism efforts and to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon), even in hypotheticals when an ally is attacked. While other polls have shown dissatisfaction with President Obama’s handling of foreign policy, public preferences nevertheless do seem to align with the administration’s general restraint. Moreover, the public’s top priority is to protect American jobs (76 percent of overall public) – which does not register very prominently among either Republican, Democratic or Independent opinion leaders’ radars in this survey.","1737","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/08/are-republicans-or-democrats-closer-to-general-american-public-opinion-on-the-middle-east/"

"Despite bipartisan support from South Carolina lawmakers to remove the Confederate flag from the state Capitol grounds, recent polling on the flag controversy tells a now-familiar story — Democrats and Republicans have strikingly dissimilar worldviews about race.

"That’s consistent with the enormous gulf between how Democrats and Republicans have reacted to race-related events in the age of Obama. In the last two years alone, reactions toward George Zimmerman’s acquittal, Donald Sterling’s forced sale of the Los Angeles Clippers, the Ferguson protesters, the decision not to indict police officers involved in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner respectively, Freddie Gray’s death while in Baltimore police custody, and even the Oscar for best picture for “12 Years a Slave” were all powerfully polarized by partisanship.","1740","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/09/democrats-increasingly-think-the-confederate-flag-is-racist-republicans-dont/"

"It’s not surprising, then, that the figure below shows that Republicans and Democrats have had increasingly different opinions about the Confederate flag. In 1992, when Gallup first asked its respondents what they thought the Confederate flag symbolized, Democrats were only 16 percentage points more likely than Republicans to say it symbolized racism. By last month, that modest difference between Democrats and Republicans had widened into a 44 percentage point schism when CNN/ORC Poll asked the exact same question.","1742","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/09/democrats-increasingly-think-the-confederate-flag-is-racist-republicans-dont/"

"Even using the more conservative CNN/ORC estimate, the graph shows that the percentage of Democrats who see the Confederate flag as a symbol of racism has nearly doubled from 31 percent in 1992 to 58 percent in 2015.

"Why? There are several plausible reasons. As we know, public opinion about a number of issues has become more divided along party lines in recent years. And Southern realignment from the Democratic to the Republican Party over the past half-century has also surely contributed to the growing partisan divide over race in general and the Confederate flag in particular.","1745","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/09/democrats-increasingly-think-the-confederate-flag-is-racist-republicans-dont/"
"But a large piece of the puzzle can still be explained by the central claim of my book: Mass politics has become more polarized by racial attitudes because of Barack Obama’s rise. As I show, the election of President Obama helped usher not a post-racial but a “most-racial” political era. Racially liberal and racially conservative Americans are now more divided over a host of political positions — evaluations of public figures, policy preferences, vote choices for Congress and party identification — than they have been in modern times.","1746","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/09/democrats-increasingly-think-the-confederate-flag-is-racist-republicans-dont/"

There's just not a ton of evidence that's true.

"There is, has been and will be somewhere between 30 and 40 percent of the national Democratic electorate who wants to support someone other than Clinton. But, there's little evidence of a groundswell against her among rank and file Democrats.","1797","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/28/6-things-we-know-about-the-2016-democratic-presidential-primary/"

"This New York Times story, detailing conversations with 75 high-level operatives and politicians, was an absolutely brutal read for Clinton and her campaign. Former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell's (D) quote -- “They’ve handled the e-mail issue poorly, maybe atrociously, certainly horribly"" -- is just a total gut punch for the Clinton folks.","1799","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/28/6-things-we-know-about-the-2016-democratic-presidential-primary/"

"The concerns of the Democratic elites has undoubtedly played a role in encouraging Vice President Biden to more actively consider entering the race. It's also forced Clinton to re-calibrate her answers on questions about the e-mail server in order to show that she understands that it is a big deal. If the Democratic chattering class continues to see Clinton as a wounded candidate, it could slow down her money and her momentum -- such as it is.","1801","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/28/6-things-we-know-about-the-2016-democratic-presidential-primary/"

"Per point No. 1 above, I don't think the Vermont democratic socialist senator is going to win the Democratic nomination. But, I do think he is a real threat to Clinton in New Hampshire.

"But even if Sanders does win New Hampshire, where does his next win come from? Given Clinton's strength among black voters, South Carolina seems like a likely win for her. Ditto Nevada, where Clinton's organizational strength will shine. So, yes, Sanders might win New Hampshire -- something previously thought unthinkable.

"I was skeptical when I first heard leaks coming out of Bidenworld that he was seriously considering running. The main reason for my skepticism was that he had just lost his eldest son to brain cancer, and it didn't seem to me to be likely that the vice president was spending much time doing anything but grieving.","1807","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/28/6-things-we-know-about-the-2016-democratic-presidential-primary/"

"Given that, it's incredibly difficult to know what he is thinking. From a practical standpoint, I have written that I think it doesn't make a ton of sense for Biden to run -- he just can't differentiate himself enough from Hillary to build a plurality -- but I am not sure practical concerns are what are motivating Biden at the moment.","1809","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/28/6-things-we-know-about-the-2016-democratic-presidential-primary/"

"From this quote by Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin about how Biden might make a good secretary of state in a Clinton administration, to Friday's release of Clinton's decisive edge among Democratic superdelegates, it's clear that the Clinton people do not want Biden in the race. That's smart, because for all of the talk about Biden helping to make Clinton a better candidate if he runs, the hard truth is that a candidacy by the vice president complicates Clinton's path to the nomination. He sits in the same establishment space as she does and, almost by default, would have to make a case that he has more and better experience in office than she does -- an argument that goes right to Clinton's greatest strength in the race.","1811","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/28/6-things-we-know-about-the-2016-democratic-presidential-primary/"
"What's much less clear to me is whether the ""we've basically already won this thing"" message being pushed by Clinton folks on superdelegates will have any impact on Biden. I could see Biden taking umbrage at such a heavy-handed approach and the tactic back-firing on Clinton.","1812","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/28/6-things-we-know-about-the-2016-democratic-presidential-primary/"

"If Clinton's continued strength in a Democratic primary is one major story in the race, her weaknesses in a general election are the other.

"It is very difficult for a politician as well-known as Clinton to change broad-scale perceptions about her. And the perception out there is that she has not been entirely forthcoming about why she had a private e-mail server at the State Department.

"The key for Democratic chances at the majority lies in landing top-tier recruits such as Gov. Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire and former senator Kay Hagan in North Carolina.

"10. Arizona (Republican-controlled): The decision of Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D) to run was a surprise to many. She seems to be gambling that a serious primary challenge to Sen.

"And, perhaps predictably, the two sides in the abortion debate credit themselves. Antiabortion activists credit new restrictions in many states, while abortion rights supporters credit the contraception mandate in President Obama's health-care law.","1852","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"Both miss some other huge factors.","1853","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"What hasn't received as much attention is the rapid rise in the share of women using stay-in-place, constantly active forms of birth control with very low failure rates such as under-the-skin implants and IUDs. In the medical world, these contraceptives are known as “long-acting reversible contraceptives.”","1854","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"And what has happened with IUDs is particularly interesting.","1855","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"IUD use reached its peak in the United States in the 1970s, then declined sharply before the devices were removed from the market because of safety concerns. Products that manufacturers and federal regulators declared safe began to return to the U.S. marketplace in 1990 but really took off beginning in the 2000s.","1856","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"The use of long-acting reversible contraceptives rose from 1.5 percent in 2002 to 7.2 percent in 2011 among girls and women ages 14 to 44, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth -- the most recent data of its kind available. And most of that growth happened because young women opted for IUDs.","1857","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"

"Another sizable factor: a sharp decline in teenage pregnancy. In 2013, the most recent year for which detailed federal data is available, there were 26.5 births among every 1,000 teenage girls in the United States. That’s down from a high of 61.8 teen births in 1991. But that decline began nearly 25 years ago. In fact, federal government statisticians say the teenage pregnancy rate actually has been in a state of slow decline since the 1950s. And perhaps more significantly, even the nation’s improved teenage pregnancy rate remains far larger than those of other countries with advanced economies.","1859","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"These two things aside, with the news about abortions in the headlines, the two sides are eager to point to their own policies.","1860","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"Abortion clinics nationwide have effectively closed as antiabortion activists have pursued a strategy of state-level regulations restricting access to them, requiring pre-abortion sonograms and waiting periods, creating new credential requirements for doctors who perform the procedures and other measures. In Mississippi, for example, only one abortion clinic remains open in the state. (That same clinic was seriously damaged in March after vandals attacked the facility while it was closed.) Proponents of these laws say they have helped shift the culture to include greater respect for life and prompted more women to carry their pregnancies to term. And to maintain these gains, groups such as Americans United for Life have lobbyists in several states.","1861","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"At the other end of the spectrum, groups that advocate for access to safe abortions say that an expansion in the availability of free and constantly active, low-failure-rate forms of birth control – such as IUDs – has fundamentally reduced the rate of unintended pregnancy among teenagers and women, therefore lowering the demand for abortion services.","1862","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"Provisions of the Affordable Care Act that have required insurance companies to cover the full cost of birth control since 2012 have ended the cost challenges that made it difficult for at least 48 million women to manage their fertility, according to a report released by the National Women’s Law Center this year. The cost of contraception was, according to the report, forcing some women to choose between such things as food, rent and birth control.","1863","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"For what it's worth, the Associated Press’s analysis of national abortion data centers around the fact that abortion rates have dipped in states with new abortion restrictions and those without them at about similar rates. But the National Women's Law Center report also found significant evidence that many insurance plans -- half of the 100 plans in 15 states that the center's staff examined in 2014 and 2015 -- simply have not complied with the Affordable Care Act. (In this case, failure to comply means refusing to cover maternity care, birth control, breast-feeding support and supplies, genetic testing, well-woman visits and prescription drugs or forcing women to share the cost of services for which the Affordable Care Act has mandated full coverage since 2012.)","1864","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"So it seems that although the Affordable Care Act does deserve some credit, it does not deserve it all. Women -- who have improved access to contraception and have chosen more reliable methods -- probably do.","1865","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/09/abortions-are-way-down-democrats-and-republicans-should-stop-congratulating-themselves/"
"On Tuesday, my Post colleagues Dan Balz and Peyton Craighill discussed the results of a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, which found that Hillary Clinton’s favorability ratings were lower than in any Post poll since 2008. The University of Wisconsin’s Charles Franklin put together this helpful graph, which shows that other polls are registering this same trend.","June 3","1866","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"","1867","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"Here was my question: who is driving this decline? Is it Republicans, in which case Clinton is losing support among voters who mostly won’t vote for her anyway? Or is she losing support among independents, or even Democrats?","1868","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"Craighill provided me some additional numbers. He broke down the trend among three groups: (1) Democrats and independents who lean Democratic, (2) “pure” independents who don’t lean toward any party, and (3) Republicans and independents who lean Republicans. This helps isolate those independents who are truly independent and not, as much research has found, closet partisans.","1869","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"Clinton’s standing among Republicans hasn’t changed in the past two months. Only 14 percent had a favorable view of her in this poll (vs. 82 percent who had an unfavorable view). The split in March was nearly identical: 15 percent-82 percent.","1870","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"But Clinton has lost support among independents. In March, 45 percent had a favorable view and 44 percent had an unfavorable view, for a net approval rating of +1 point. That has now fallen to -14 points (37 percent-51 percent). Craighill notes that the sample size of pure independents is small (86 in the March survey and 97 in the May survey). So take this trend with a grain of salt.","1871","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"Even more striking is that Clinton has lost support among Democrats. In March, her net favorability rating was +59 points (78 percent-19 percent). It is now +50 percent (72 percent-22 percent). Of course, she is still very popular among Democrats. But because Democrats are far more numerous than pure independents, they are driving most of the trend that the Post polls document.","1872","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"On the one hand, this is bad news for Clinton. Pure independents are less likely to vote than partisans, but at least some will. No candidate wants a net favorability rating of -14 points among this group.","1873","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"And the fact that Clinton has lost ground among Democrats suggests that the negative news coverage of the past two months — e.g., regarding her e-mails while secretary of state — actually took some toll. If it were just making Republicans like her less, that would be one thing. This is different.","1874","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"But there is good news for Clinton too. Clinton’s standing among Democrats will likely only improve as the campaign goes on — particularly when there she has a clear Republican opponent. As I’ve noted before, campaigns almost always rally each party’s voters behind their nominee. So Clinton’s decline among Democrats is probably temporary.","1875","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"
"Moreover, as Franklin also observed, Clinton is viewed more favorably than almost every GOP candidates — and none of the Republicans are viewed that favorably, period. The interesting question ahead is how views of these Republicans change, or don’t change, as more and more Americans become familiar with them.","1876","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-are-falling-among-democrats/"

"On style, however, Clinton has told them that she will campaign and then govern side by side with them, with the hope that it will make lawmakers feel more invested in her success.

"There's a fascinating finding in a new NBC-Wall Street Journal national poll: Republicans say that national security/terrorism is the single most important issue facing the country.","May 4","1912","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"
"More than a quarter of Republicans (27 percent) chose that option, putting it ahead of ""deficit and government spending"" (24 percent) and, somewhat remarkably, ""job creation and economic growth"" (21 percent), which has long dominated as the top priority for voters of all partisan stripes.","1913","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"
"Beyond those top line numbers, there are two other telling nuggets in the data.","1914","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"
"The first is that Republican voters are twice as concerned as Democrats about national security and terrorism. In the NBC-WSJ survey, just 13 percent of Democrats named national security as the most pressing issue for the government; job creation and economic growth was far and away the biggest concern among Democrats (37 percent), with health care (17 percent) and climate change (15 percent) ranking ahead of national security and terrorism.","1915","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"
"The second is that national security is a rapidly rising concern for Republicans. In NBC-WSJ poll data from March 2012, just eight percent of Republicans named it as the most important issue for the government to address.","1916","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"
"There's no single or simple explanation for that threefold increase, although the focus on the Islamic state and its barbaric (and high-profile) killing of hostages has clearly played a major role. In a recent conversation, a savvy Republican media consultant told me that the Islamic State attacks coupled with the release (and subsequent controversy) over ""American Sniper,"" a film that tells the story of Chris Kyle, has had a profound effect on the average Republican base voter.","1917","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"
"That effect amounts to an unease about the idea that the Islamic State operates by no rules or common humanity combined with a sort of rally-around-the-flag sentiment occasioned by a belief that some Americans have lost the necessary focus on the threat posed by militant groups.","1918","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"

Most obviously that GOP candidates staking out traditionally hawkish policy views on foreign policy are likely to gain traction in the primary race while those not hewing that line -- Rand Paul, I am looking at you -- may struggle.","1919","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"
"It also suggests that the outlines of the 2016 general election campaign could resemble those of 2004 when the central issue in the election was which candidate would keep Americans safe. Obviously, it's an imperfect comparison because that election came just three years removed from the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and featured a president who had been in office during those attacks.","1920","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"
"What remains to be seen is how and whether the eventual Republican nominee can make the case that Hillary Clinton the eventual Democratic nominee is insufficiently committed or able to keep the country safe. That could be a tough sell given the relative thinness of the GOP field's experience on foreign policy -- especially when contrasted with the depth and breadth of Clinton's resume on those same issues.","1921","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/twice-as-many-republicans-as-democrats-believe-national-security-is-the-1-issue-facing-the-country/"
"MINNEAPOLIS — Hillary Rodham Clinton sought to cement her standing as the rightful leader of the Democratic Party here Friday, but two of her challengers launched a fierce counterattack against her and a party establishment they see as trying to hand her the 2016 presidential nomination.","August 28","1922","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-challengers-launch-attacks-against-clinton-party-leadership/2015/08/28/722bc1c6-4d9b-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html"
"What began as a routine forum of candidate speeches evolved into a surprisingly dramatic day at the Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting, as Sen.

"Speaking from the dais, with DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz sitting a few feet away, O’Malley blasted the party’s limited number of sanctioned debates as a process “rigged” in favor of the front-runner.

"The barbs from Sanders and O’Malley came as Clinton and her campaign flexed their organizational muscle here.

"In her address to a ballroom full of DNC members, Clinton sought to position herself as the undisputed Democratic standard-bearer. She fired up the party faithful with a call to arms against Republicans as dangerously out of touch and peppered her remarks with gibes at current GOP front-runner Donald Trump — including a suggestion that his hair, although natural, is dyed like her own.","1931","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-challengers-launch-attacks-against-clinton-party-leadership/2015/08/28/722bc1c6-4d9b-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html"
"“The party of Lincoln has become the party of Trump,” Clinton said. She mocked Trump for suggesting that she did not understand women’s health issues and that he would be a better advocate. “Now that’s a general election debate that’s going to be a lot of fun,” she said.","1932","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-challengers-launch-attacks-against-clinton-party-leadership/2015/08/28/722bc1c6-4d9b-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html"
"Clinton said that Trump is getting most of the media attention this summer but that the other Republican candidates are making statements that ought to scare mainstream voters. “They’re Trump without the pizazz and the hair,” she said.","1933","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-challengers-launch-attacks-against-clinton-party-leadership/2015/08/28/722bc1c6-4d9b-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html"
"Clinton made no reference in her speech to the controversy surrounding her use of a private ­e-mail server while secretary of state. When asked about it later in a news conference, Clinton said: “I have said repeatedly that I did not send nor receive classified material, and I’m very confident when this entire process plays out, that will be understood by everyone. It will prove what I have been saying.”","1934","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-challengers-launch-attacks-against-clinton-party-leadership/2015/08/28/722bc1c6-4d9b-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html"
"Former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee raised eyebrows when he touted himself as ­scandal-free in his remarks. He later said this was not “a direct swipe at anybody.” But pressed on how Clinton has handled the ­e-mail issue, Chafee said: “The rules are the rules, and we all have to adhere to them, and when you don’t, you suffer the consequences. Unfortunately this is self-inflicted.”","1935","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-challengers-launch-attacks-against-clinton-party-leadership/2015/08/28/722bc1c6-4d9b-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html"

"O’Malley used his time onstage to highlight his dissatisfaction with the DNC’s management of the debates. He argued forcefully that as Trump and other Republican candidates dominate news coverage with inflammatory rhetoric, Democrats would be wise to hold more, not fewer, nationally televised debates to highlight the differences between the parties.","1937","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-challengers-launch-attacks-against-clinton-party-leadership/2015/08/28/722bc1c6-4d9b-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html"
"“Will we let the circus run unchallenged on every channel while we cower in shadows under a decree of silence in the ranks? Or will we demand equal time to showcase our ideas?” O’Malley asked.","1938","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-challengers-launch-attacks-against-clinton-party-leadership/2015/08/28/722bc1c6-4d9b-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html"

Voters don't dislike Clinton — they like her! But, they don't love her.

"First of all, let's emphasize that it's not too surprising that people choose upward mobility over income inequality. After all, helping ""middle and working class"" Americans get ahead makes inequality less of an issue in and of itself. It's like killing two birds with one stone.

"But even if the poll question is something of an imperfect or false choice, it does hint at the limits of the income inequality argument.

We took exit poll data and compared mortality rates from 2009 (for the 2008 voters) and 2013 (for the 2012 ones) to figure out how many of the voters would have shuffled off their voting coil by the next election cycle. Our figures are lower than McGraw's, mostly because we used the bottom-tier mortality rate for each age group.

"We have our own cascade of caveats here. A 65-year-old voter in 2008 will be 73 by the time 2016 rolls around. The Baby Boomers kept getting older and their mortality rates keep increasing. So it's safe to assume that the death rate will have ticked upward more between 2012 and 2016 than between 2008 and 2012.

"Again, the question comes back to how they vote. The Republican party has done a good job of solidifying the existing over-65 vote, but it remains to be seen if people who age into that demographic will vote increasingly conservatively as well.

Hillary Clinton, in a recent speech, offers a version of the Democratic narrative — that Bill Clinton balanced the budget and left behind a huge surplus that was squandered by his successor, George W. Bush.","2041","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"Given that Hillary Clinton might end up facing former Florida governor Jeb Bush in the general election, it certainly makes political sense for her to suggest that her husband rescued the economy from George H.W. Bush, only to have it wrecked by his son George W. Bush — and Barack Obama had to pick up the pieces. As she also said in her speech, Republicans “just don’t know the theory of original sin, because we wouldn’t have had to have a recovery if we hadn’t had the kind of poor management and bad economic policies that put us into the ditch in the first place.”","2042","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"

"Regular readers know that The Fact Checker frowns on claims that suggest a president is responsible for every good or bad thing that happens to an economy on his watch. The U.S. economy is huge — and decisions made long ago continue to reverberate in the future.

"The Clinton campaign offered David Kamin, a campaign adviser and New York University law professor, to make the case. Essentially, he argued that the boom in the 1990s was the direct result of policies advanced by Bill Clinton, in particular a 1993 budget-deficit plan that attracted no Republican votes. Moreover, he said the shift from budget surpluses to budget deficits in the 2000s was not inevitable and was the direct result of policy choices made by the George W. Bush administration. (Under ground rules set by the campaign, direct quotes from Kamin could not be used.)","2046","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"

"Republicans predicted gloom and doom if Clinton’s plan was passed into law, but they turned out to be wrong. But it’s important to remember that Clinton’s plan was never intended to achieve a balanced budget. After the bill’s passage, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the deficit would decline modestly — from $290 billion in 1992 to $200 billion in 1998. In the phrase of the era, there were still “deficits as far as the eye could see.”","2051","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"The Clinton budget plan was actually slightly smaller, on an inflation-adjusted basis, than the bipartisan deficit-reduction package signed into law in 1990 by George H.W. Bush. Both budget deals included a mechanism known as “PAYGO” — pay as you go — which prevented lawmakers from boosting spending without paying for it with additional revenue.","2052","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"Fast forward to 1995. The Democrats had lost control of the House and the Senate, largely because of bruising budget battles. Clinton’s fiscal 1996 budget proposed $200 billion deficits every year for the next five years. So, again, the target in 1998 (when surpluses later emerged) was a deficit of $196 billion.","2053","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"But Republicans, who were now in charge of Congress, immediately set the goal of achieving a balanced budget within seven years. After resisting for a few months, Clinton shocked many fellow Democrats by announcing that he, too, would embrace the idea of a balanced budget.

"As The Washington Post editorial page put it at the time, Republicans had forced Clinton’s hand: “Mr. Clinton’s new position on the budget is much better than the old one. He should have taken it six months ago. The Republicans have driven him to say that he too wants, if not to balance the budget, at least to get the deficit into the neutral zone.”","2055","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"

"Meanwhile, there were economic forces that had little to do with either Democrats or Republicans; Clinton was lucky to have become president just as a revolution in computer and information technologies was unleashed. A gusher of tax revenue emerged, primarily from capital-gains taxes, because of the run-up in the stock market, as well as taxes paid on stock options earned by technology executives.","2057","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"From 1992 to 1997, CBO estimated, tax revenue increased at an annual average of 7.7 percent in nominal terms, or about 2.4 percentage points faster than the growth of the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy. CBO Deputy Director James L. Blum in 1998 attributed only one percentage point of that extra tax revenue to the 1993 budget deal. The rest, he said, came from capital gains.","2058","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"

"Dean Baker, a left-leaning economist, has written that CBO projections indicate that the stock bubble led to a $780 billion decline in the deficit after 1996. “The hero of the budget surplus story was the stock bubble,” not President Clinton’s tax policies and budgets, he says.","2060","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"There were other factors as well, such as lower-than-expected health costs that reduced an expected drain on the budget. George H.W. Bush, Clinton’s predecessor, also had kicked in motion a huge decline in defense spending (which Clinton accelerated) and had overseen a painful restructuring of the banking industry. Even a potential shock, such as the Asian financial crisis in 1997, brought the silver lining of lower oil prices that bolstered the U.S. economy.","2061","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"

"In the 2000 campaign, both George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore had grand plans for tapping the surplus. (In January 2001, the CBO estimated that the surplus would total $5.6 trillion over 10 years, but the campaigns had based their plans on a July 2000 estimate of $2.2 trillion — which shows how quickly these numbers can change.)","2064","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in 2000 produced an analysis that concluded that Bush’s proposed policies would tap $1.9 trillion of the surplus, while Gore had proposed using $1.4 trillion. Bush, of course, touted a $1.3 trillion tax cut, but Gore had countered with a $500 billion tax cut — and had planned to hike spending. For instance, he proposed to spend $350 billion on a Medicare prescription drug benefit.

"“The stock bubble began to burst in 2000,” Baker noted. “By the summer of 2002 stocks had fallen to roughly half of their peak values, destroying $10 trillion in wealth. This gave us a recession which, although officially short and mild, led to the longest period without net job creation since the Great Depression” (before the 2008 recession).","2068","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"The economy also suffered a major shock with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 — and, of course, the nation embarked on wars in Afghanistan and then Iraq. The PAYGO spending restraints expired, and Bush and Congress funded the wars and homeland security improvements, and a Medicare prescription drug plan, through deficit financing. (Previously, Congress generally would finance wars through increases in taxes or a tax surcharge, but Bush pushed through a second tax cut to bolster the economy.)","2069","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"Within a year of the $5.6 trillion-surplus estimate, a chagrined CBO had to come back to Congress and admit that its revenue estimates were off — way off. A weakened economy, the popping of the bubble in tech stocks and other factors meant that hundreds of billions of dollars in expected revenue had turned out to be ephemeral. In just a year, capital gains returns fell 20 percent; income growth from stock options fell as much as 40 percent, the CBO estimated. Suddenly, the years of supposed surpluses had turned into deficits.","2070","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"“The ending of this bubble was the biggest factor turning the surplus into a deficit. The Bush tax cuts were very much secondary in this picture, as were his wars and the Medicare drug plan,” Baker said. “The Bush administration might deserve serious grief for all three of these, but they were not the story of the end of the Clinton-era surpluses. The end of the stock bubble was the end of the budget surpluses and that one cannot be blamed on President Bush.”","2071","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"Kamin points to the fact that by 2003, it was very clear that the surpluses were gone, and yet Bush persisted on additional tax cuts and deficit-financed war funding, thus digging the fiscal hole even deeper.","2072","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"
"By contrast, Kamin said, Bill Clinton in his first year as president pushed through significant deficit reduction, which helped change the fiscal trajectory, without any votes from Republicans. Clinton, he said, maintained that fiscally prudent course by vetoing GOP efforts to pass a tax cut and instead committed the nation to fully paying down the national debt in his last budget plan. “We have started to pay down the national debt and are on a path to make the Nation debt free by 2013 for the first time since 1835,” Clinton declared in his budget introduction.","2073","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"

"In 2012, the CBO issued a final document demonstrating exactly how much it had erred in its 2001 forecast — and how much the swing from surpluses to deficits could be attributed to policy choices made by Congress and either George W.

"In other words, much of the money that Gore had said he would have saved for paying down the debt, after paying for all of his other projects, would not have been there. Of course, we can’t go back in time and determine exactly what would have happened in a Gore presidency.

"It is certainly fair game for Hillary Clinton to compare the fiscal record of the Clinton administration with the record of the George W.

"Al Gore’s tax cut probably would have been smaller than Bush’s $1.3 trillion plan, but would Gore have financed the post-9/11 wars with a tax hike? Perhaps. But he would have needed approval from a GOP-controlled House opposed to tax increases, especially in a weak economy. That would have been a contentious debate. One could also make a case that a President Gore would not have attacked Iraq — but that’s also not entirely certain, given that his vice president would have been Iraq hawk Joe Lieberman.","2078","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-claim-that-a-democratic-president-would-have-paid-down-the-national-debt/"

"Democratic Party fundraisers, activists and strategists recognized early this year that this deficit must be addressed, because it’s allowing major GOP policy advances on the state level, and imperiling Democratic chances (due to the role of state legislatures in redistricting, which will happen again after 2020) of winning back the House anytime soon.

"This problem received a new burst of attention this week when Vox’s Matthew Yglesias published a piece painting the Dem state-level woes in unusually vivid and sobering terms, arguing that Dems are “in denial” about them and “don’t even admit that they exist.” Some on the left pushed back, noting it is unfair to say Democrats are unaware of this; indeed, some Dems have been publicly and privately discussing what to do about it for a year.

"One possible answer lies in winning back governorships. That’s not just because governors obviously wield great influence over state policy; it’s also because they can exercise far more influence over redistricting (the province of state legislatures) in most states than is commonly known.

"The big years are 2017 and 2018, when we have 38 races. Nine out of 10 of the largest states are up in that cycle. There will be at least 20 or more open seats.

"PEARSON: Yes. No doubt this has been problematic for Democrats. There has not been as much focus on state level politics. That has not been the case on the Republican side.

"SANDERS: Let's begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA. Let's also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons. And over the years, I have strongly supported instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole. And I think we've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers. Correction: An earlier version of this transcript misquoted Bernie Sanders as saying, ""And over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole.""

There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world.","2470","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-oct-13-democratic-debate-who-said-what-and-what-it-means/"

"As 538’s Harry Enten has pointed out, if Wasserman Schultz does stick to the six debates, it would be the fewest the party has held in a year when there wasn’t a Democratic president seeking a second term since 1980.

"“It’s bad for us as a Democratic Party to act in undemocratic ways and try to limit debates in some sort of misguided effort to prop up or circle the wagon around this year’s inevitable front-runner,” O’Malley told a local TV station over the weekend, adding that Wasserman Schultz was committing “party malpractice.”","3049","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-have-a-growing-debate-problem-on-their-hands/2015/09/20/e3d8194c-5fc9-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"

"There is something wrong with the Democratic Party. The candidate who is providing the only real sizzle in the Democratic presidential race right now is Bernie Sanders, a 74-year-old socialist senator from Vermont who is something of a oddball. Hillary Clinton, their front-runner, a soon-to-be 68-year-old party stalwart, is stale, bogged down in scandal and can’t draw a crowd. So, who is it that many in the Democratic Party are looking to as the party’s “savior” in the face of the unremarkable Democratic field so far? Answer: Joe Biden, a 72-year-old, former six-term senator from Delaware and the current vice president. And this isn’t the only evidence that the Democrats have a problem. There is fundamentally something wrong with their candidate pool. In the 2014 midterm elections, the Democrats’ top two senatorial candidates, Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky and Michelle Nunn in Georgia, were generational retreads trying to capitalize on famous fathers from a generation ago. And the Democrats’ trophy gubernatorial candidate, Charlie Crist, was a former Republican governor of Florida.","September 23","3064","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/23/the-insiders-where-are-the-democrats-fresh-faces/"
"So what does this say about the Democratic Party? It’s interesting to note that the Democrats spend a lot of time wagging their fingers at the Republican Party for being too old and too white. Well, the common denominator for all three of the Democrats’ most viable presidential candidates in 2016 is that they are white and over 65. The Democrats savor their diversity, and the primary composition of their party base is young people, Hispanics and African-Americans. But their candidates do not reflect that demographic composition. Barack Obama is president because he was able to produce a spike in turnout among young voters, blacks, Hispanics and Asians. It is hard to make the case that any of the Democratic candidates are going to be able to produce the same type of enthusiasm that generated the spike in turnout that propelled Obama to the presidency.","3065","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/23/the-insiders-where-are-the-democrats-fresh-faces/"
"Republicans thought in 2012 that even if Mitt Romney’s candidacy lacked excitement, voters’ disillusionment with the Obama presidency would be enough to drive Republican turnout and win back the White House. Well, we were wrong. And no matter how much the Democrats try to make people fearful of Republicans, if they do not have energy and enthusiasm on their side, the Democratic coalition may not vote for the Republican nominee, but it also may not vote at all.","3066","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/23/the-insiders-where-are-the-democrats-fresh-faces/"

"Early in the debate, Clinton seized on Sanders’s record on gun control, arguing that he had not been strong enough in standing up to the National Rifle Association.

"Clinton and Sanders were at the center of attention on the stage in Las Vegas, but three other candidates — former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, former senator Jim Webb of Virginia, and former Rhode Island senator and governor Lincoln Chafee — sought to intrude, looking to give their lagging campaigns a boost before the biggest national audience they’ve had all year.","3189","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-sanders-dominate-democrats-first-go-on-the-debate-stage/2015/10/13/94d399a6-71cc-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html"
"O’Malley, who has been sharply critical of Clinton in his campaign speeches, was restrained Tuesday as he tried to highlight his record on criminal justice, immigration and other issues.

"The debate was considered a make-or-break opportunity for the low-polling O’Malley, who has struggled to make good on what had appeared to be a promising position as an accomplished and telegenic executive.

"The argument, initiated by former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley but embraced by Sen.

"The most obvious is that debates offer free publicity. Instead of paying for TV spots that hit a few thousand people at a time, debates offer candidates — especially less-well-known candidates — primetime coverage of their ideas and their handsome former-Maryland-governor faces. Carly Fiorina polled second in a recent CNN/ORC poll based almost entirely on her performances in the first two Republican debates.","3229","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/21/why-non-clinton-democrats-are-upset-about-the-lack-of-debates-and-why-they-should-be/"
"Which is the next reason candidates want more debates: It can move the polls. In 2012, debates offered a chance for voters to hear from a wide range of candidates —some of whom then went on to surge in the polls. And then the surges would end, sometimes also because of what happened in the debates. It's worth noting, in the graphs above, that the biggest spikes in polling tend to come after voting starts. Obama's big surge came after Iowa; McCain was already ascendant before the voting began but took off after. In 2012, Mitt Romney and his opponents saw spikes after they did well on primary ballots. That's why we put the free TV point first.","3230","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/21/why-non-clinton-democrats-are-upset-about-the-lack-of-debates-and-why-they-should-be/"
"O'Malley and Sanders also get to imply that the system is rigged. Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz — who was speaking in New Hampshire during the chanting in the video above — has been accused of curtailing the number of debates to help Clinton, whom she backed in 2008. Regardless of the veracity of that claim, it's a powerful motivator for the non-Clinton candidates. Sanders gets to bolster his anti-establishment credentials by arguing that the establishment is literally introducing roadblocks to his success. Making that point loudly doesn't hurt — especially since Clinton doesn't appear to be terribly eager for more debates.","3231","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/21/why-non-clinton-democrats-are-upset-about-the-lack-of-debates-and-why-they-should-be/"

"Clinton (and the DNC) probably recognize that the outcry over the number of debates will fade as soon as the party has its first event — which is coming up in mid-October.

"We’ll get to the answer Sanders gave in a moment, but first, some context. When Barack Obama was elected, congressional Republicans made what was in some ways a strategically shrewd decision, that they were going to oppose him on basically everything. Because he started with huge majorities in both houses of Congress, he had an extraordinary record of legislative achievement in his first two years, that opposition notwithstanding. But in 2010 Republicans won the House, and four years after that they took the Senate. For all intents and purposes, legislating was over.","3235","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/14/why-the-democratic-candidates-cant-confront-the-real-elephant-in-the-room/"
"In those two wave elections of 2010 and 2014, a generation of extremely conservative Republicans who viewed all compromise as betrayal were elected, moving the party to the right ideologically and making it far more obstructionist. Now let’s say a Democrat wins in 2016. What happens then?","3236","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/14/why-the-democratic-candidates-cant-confront-the-real-elephant-in-the-room/"
"It’s almost a certainty that Republicans will retain control of the House. Democrats have a chance to win back the Senate (Republicans have to defend many more seats, because everyone who won in 2010 is up for reelection), but even if they do, it certainly won’t be with a filibuster-proof majority. Not only that, if Democrats make gains, it will be in those few competitive states and House districts, which would mean that the remaining Republicans would as a group be even more conservative than they are now. Are they going to be in the mood to work with a Democratic president?","3237","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/14/why-the-democratic-candidates-cant-confront-the-real-elephant-in-the-room/"

"In 2007, Mark Schmitt called the argument among Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards the “theory of change primary.” As Clinton would describe it in speeches, Edwards thought you demand change, Obama thought you hope for change, and she thought you work for change. Sanders’ theory, as he lays it out here, is essentially that you force change, by making it too politically dangerous for Republicans to resist.","3239","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/14/why-the-democratic-candidates-cant-confront-the-real-elephant-in-the-room/"
"Which is realistic in one way and unrealistic in another. On one hand, Sanders is not bothering to indulge the dream that you can reach across the aisle and bring Democrats and Republicans together. In fact, no candidate from either party is saying that — and after the last seven years, who could do so with a straight face? But that’s a dramatic change from the last couple of decades.","3240","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/14/why-the-democratic-candidates-cant-confront-the-real-elephant-in-the-room/"
"Though they all ended up inspiring partisan passions, our last three presidents all ran as conciliators who could unite Washington and the country. Bill Clinton was going to create a liberal/conservative synthesis, a “Third Way” that could attract support from both parties. George W. Bush touted his record working with Democrats in Texas. “I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect,” he said in his 2000 convention speech. Barack Obama, who became a national figure in a 2004 convention speech where he said, “there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there’s the United States of America,” thought that he could sit down with everyone, earnestly listen to their concerns, and bring them around at least some of the time. All three presidents failed at this goal.","3241","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/14/why-the-democratic-candidates-cant-confront-the-real-elephant-in-the-room/"

Ryan Claassen is a political scientist at Kent State University and the author of a provocative new book called “Godless Democrats and Pious Republicans?” that seeks to explain the “God Gap” between the parties.

"JS: The “God Gap” means that people who are more religious have become a larger part of the Republican Party base, and people who are less religious have become a larger part of the Democratic Party base. What’s the conventional explanation for this trend?","3338","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/04/how-democrats-became-secular-and-republicans-became-religious-its-not-what-you-think/"

"In reaction to the rising influence of the Christian Right, the story goes, “seculars” – those who do not attend religious services or claim an association with an organized religion – moved to the Democratic Party.","3340","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/04/how-democrats-became-secular-and-republicans-became-religious-its-not-what-you-think/"

"RC: That’s right. I question the conventional wisdom. Take the rise of evangelical Republican activists. One reason why they’ve increased as a part of the Republican base is as simple as an increase in the number of evangelicals in society as a whole. This is because of their robust birthrates, the fact that the children of evangelicals tend to identify as evangelicals as adults, and the fact that some people have converted to an evangelical faith. This helps to create the appearance of mobilization, but it’s not necessarily mobilization.","3343","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/04/how-democrats-became-secular-and-republicans-became-religious-its-not-what-you-think/"
"Similarly, if more evangelicals are voting, and more evangelical voters are supporting the Republican Party, then it is possible that the rise of evangelicals among GOP activists has nothing to do with mobilizing evangelical campaign activists.","3344","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/04/how-democrats-became-secular-and-republicans-became-religious-its-not-what-you-think/"

"JS: But how about the idea that certain groups within the public — like Evangelicals — have just become more political? There’s this idea that Evangelicals used to shun politics in the here-and-now because they were more focused on, well, the afterlife. But not any more. Has this affected the God Gap?","3347","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/04/how-democrats-became-secular-and-republicans-became-religious-its-not-what-you-think/"
"RC: I know something about this topic. As a Mennonite I graduated from a college owned by the Mennonite Church, Goshen College in Indiana, and my adviser there was an outspoken advocate of avoiding politics for religious reasons. But I vote regularly and I do not appear to be unusual among evangelicals in that sense. Relatively high turnout rates among evangelicals dating back to the early 1960s suggest that non-participation for religious reasons is not a major part of the story.","3348","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/04/how-democrats-became-secular-and-republicans-became-religious-its-not-what-you-think/"

"JS: If it’s less about turnout, what about the idea that partisan loyalties have simply changed?

"RC: I do find that changes in party loyalty matter a great deal, but don’t forget that loyalty changes, while more impressive than turnout changes, are mostly dwarfed by demographic changes. It is true that evangelicals have become more loyal to the GOP over time, and this helps explain why they’re a larger fraction of Republican activists, but loyalty is one of several factors and not the most important one.","3352","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/04/how-democrats-became-secular-and-republicans-became-religious-its-not-what-you-think/"
"Also the Republican Party has always been dominated by religious people. It used to be that these religious people were mostly mainline Protestants, and now they’re mostly evangelical Protestants. A democratic trend among mainline Protestants is an important part of this change — even though such a trend runs counter to God Gap punditry.","3353","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/04/how-democrats-became-secular-and-republicans-became-religious-its-not-what-you-think/"

"In fact, most religious people that are not evangelical Protestants are actually trending Democratic. In recent elections, there are Democratic trends in every major religious tradition except for Evangelical Protestants.

"RC: Of course it’s true that activists are different than “ordinary” voters in well-established ways, but I find that they are no more different now than they were in the 1960s.

"This is oversimplified. Yes, seculars have always voted for Democrats at higher rates than for Republicans.

"When Anderson asked Sanders whether he could be elected while identifying as a “democratic socialist,” he said: “We’re gonna win, because first we’re gonna explain what democratic socialism is.” Sanders said that he wanted to replicate conditions seen in other industrialized countries, including free health care and paid family leave.","3404","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-debate-may-lack-gop-fire-but-clinton-rivals-seek-to-score-hits/2015/10/13/abd904b2-719d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"“We are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America, and it’s our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism,” she said, referring to Sanders’s statement that he was not a capitalist. “We would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class” in the world, she said.","3406","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-debate-may-lack-gop-fire-but-clinton-rivals-seek-to-score-hits/2015/10/13/abd904b2-719d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Sanders struck back when Clinton was questioned about her relationships with Wall Street. She sought to combat suggestions that she is too closely aligned with the big banks, saying she had personally scolded Wall Street bankers to “cut it out,” months before the financial crisis of 2008.","3407","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-debate-may-lack-gop-fire-but-clinton-rivals-seek-to-score-hits/2015/10/13/abd904b2-719d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"“I respect the passion and intensity. I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York,” Clinton said, after hearing Sanders outline a plan to break up big banks. She described meeting with Wall Street bankers in 2007. “I basically said, cut it out. Quit foreclosing on homes. Quit engaging in these speculative behaviors.”","3408","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-debate-may-lack-gop-fire-but-clinton-rivals-seek-to-score-hits/2015/10/13/abd904b2-719d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"As the five candidates onstage debated that issue, Chafee, who could afford few missteps, appeared to make one. Asked why had supported a measure that repealed a decades-old regulation and empowered Wall Street banks, Chafee’s answer appeared to be that he didn’t fully understand the bill.","3411","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-debate-may-lack-gop-fire-but-clinton-rivals-seek-to-score-hits/2015/10/13/abd904b2-719d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"“I just arrived in the Senate. I think we get some [do-overs],” Chafee said. At the time, his father Sen.

"For Chafee, Webb and O’Malley, performance in the debate was critical. They are all polling below 1 percent, according to the average of polls at Real Clear Politics. If they were Republicans, they’d be relegated to the undercard, debating other margin-of-error candidates at dinnertime.","3415","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-debate-may-lack-gop-fire-but-clinton-rivals-seek-to-score-hits/2015/10/13/abd904b2-719d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"But in the smaller Democratic field, there is room for them. And all of them needed to make an impression, in order to attract donors and voters.

"O’Malley, trying desperately to stand out, had his most memorable moments in the opening and closing statements as he seemed to try to take some of Sanders’s thunder by seizing on economic inequality. He also challenged Sanders on his stance on gun control, noting that as governor, he led Maryland in passing such measures.","3418","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-debate-may-lack-gop-fire-but-clinton-rivals-seek-to-score-hits/2015/10/13/abd904b2-719d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"Webb, at one point, complained of not being called on at all. “I’ve been standing over here for about 10 minutes here,” he said, before finally being asked his opinions about foreign policy.","3420","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-debate-may-lack-gop-fire-but-clinton-rivals-seek-to-score-hits/2015/10/13/abd904b2-719d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Webb tried to score some points where he could. He took a jab at Sanders call for a “political revolution” to bring him to the White House and other changes to Washington. Webb questioned whether — even under a President Sanders — that kind of revolution was possible.","3421","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-debate-may-lack-gop-fire-but-clinton-rivals-seek-to-score-hits/2015/10/13/abd904b2-719d-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"Hillary Rodham Clinton: People forget that of the 203 debates — that’s a rough estimate — in the 2008 Democratic primaries, Clinton won 80 percent of them. She’s a far more tested debater than anyone else who will be on the stage Tuesday and has faced far tougher circumstances than this one; in 2008, she went against Barack Obama, John Edwards (who made his fortune as a trial lawyer), and the likes of Biden and Chris Dodd — who knew something about debating given their time in the Senate.","3427","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-to-expect-from-tuesdays-democratic-presidential-debate/2015/10/11/5b87a22c-7024-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

She’s an able counter-puncher when she needs to be.","3428","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-to-expect-from-tuesdays-democratic-presidential-debate/2015/10/11/5b87a22c-7024-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"The important question in this debate is one that is out of her hands. How hard do any of her opponents go after her, and on what? Does the controversy over her e-mail server come up? If so, who does the attacking, and how negative (if at all) does Clinton go in return?","3429","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-to-expect-from-tuesdays-democratic-presidential-debate/2015/10/11/5b87a22c-7024-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Bernie Sanders: This debate has almost nothing but an upside for the Vermont socialist. His supporters will drink up his authenticity and willingness to say things that the others — most notably, Clinton — won’t. For Democrats who might not know Sanders yet, his strict adherence to liberal principles will appeal.","3430","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-to-expect-from-tuesdays-democratic-presidential-debate/2015/10/11/5b87a22c-7024-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Sanders would be well served to push his differences with Clinton — his early opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for instance — in front of what will be the largest audience of the campaign to date. But his stated unwillingness to attack may preclude a true hit on her. That would be a mistake.","3431","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-to-expect-from-tuesdays-democratic-presidential-debate/2015/10/11/5b87a22c-7024-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"O’Malley is well aware of his need to break out — and that makes him the most interesting and unpredictable force in this debate.

"But will he take on Clinton’s e-mail server and the questions of whether she is honest and trustworthy enough to be the party’s nominee?

"Jim Webb: The former one-term senator from Virginia is an acerbic personality who doesn’t back down — ever.

"On what? That’s harder to know, because why Webb is running — and on what issues — has been remarkably hard to figure out.

"Stylistically, Chafee will have a hard time standing out — or being noticed at all — as he is unassuming and very soft spoken. He will benefit from the fact that only four other people will be onstage, meaning that by default, he will get a decent amount of speaking time.","3441","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-to-expect-from-tuesdays-democratic-presidential-debate/2015/10/11/5b87a22c-7024-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

Senior Dems such as Nancy Pelosi and Howard Dean have criticized the DNC.

Between those two and the one in January, there will be only three Dem debates in 2016, during the period in which Democrats will be voting in dozens of contests — from the early contests through the big state primaries in early and mid March, a period that could very well settle the outcome. By contrast, Republicans have six debates scheduled throughout that period, many on major networks.","3458","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/21/how-democrats-got-bogged-down-in-a-messy-dispute-over-debates/"
"As it is, the GOP debates are drawing very big audiences. It’s true that this is due to the Trump carnival — making this in some ways a negative for the GOP. But the positive side for the GOP is that enormous numbers of voters are seeing the other GOP candidates in strong moments, which is good both for GOP organizing in the primaries and for giving them and their ideas exposure beyond the GOP primary audience. Add to this the imbalance in the number of debates in this 2016 window, when voters are seriously tuning in, and Dems risk ceding the airwaves and squandering a chance to build excitement and engage more voters, some party officials have argued.","3459","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/21/how-democrats-got-bogged-down-in-a-messy-dispute-over-debates/"
"“Left unchecked, the superior RNC schedule could easily reach 50 to 100 million more eyeballs than the current Democratic schedule — meaning tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of lost opportunities to persuade, engage and excite the audiences all Democrats will need to win in 2016,” argues Dem strategist Simon Rosenberg.","3460","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/21/how-democrats-got-bogged-down-in-a-messy-dispute-over-debates/"

Clinton won’t clarify whether she actively wants more debates, and her campaign very well may not want that at all, given the details of the tick-tock I’ve laid out above. Even if the DNC’s original decision to set six debates is somewhat defensible, given how this all unfolded, things seem to be spiraling out of the committee’s control, now that we have the schedule itself and now that we’re seeing huge audiences tuning in to the GOP debates.","3462","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/21/how-democrats-got-bogged-down-in-a-messy-dispute-over-debates/"

This time, the DNC has also instituted an “exclusivity” clause: If a candidate participates in a non-DNC-sanctioned debate, he or she is theoretically forbidden from participating in DNC-sanctioned ones, making it a lot less likely that non-sanctioned ones will take place.","3465","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/21/how-democrats-got-bogged-down-in-a-messy-dispute-over-debates/"

"In the fall of 1991, a Democratic presidential candidate I was covering as he campaigned across New Hampshire had a line in his speeches that surprised me.

"On Tuesday night, I was forcefully reminded of the then-Arkansas governor’s unanticipated endorsement of Scandinavian democratic socialist policy by former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s takedown of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) invocation of Denmark as a model for progressive change in the United States. My point isn’t that Bill Clinton was a socialist in liberal garb; his support for increasing the size and clout of the financial sector is proof positive that he wasn’t. It’s that the relationship between the European social democracy that Sanders extols and the American progressivism that Hillary Clinton champions is complicated and at times symbiotic, with clear areas of overlap and difference.","3479","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-democrats-need-both-clinton-and-sanders/2015/10/14/c64e944e-729f-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"The social democracies of Northern Europe have higher and more progressive tax rates than we do, which fund a far greater range of social benefits than we do as well. U.S. liberals also favor more progressive taxation and greater social benefits (paid sick days, expanded health coverage). To the extent that this is not just a quantitative but a qualitative distinction, it’s because the European social democratic belief in citizens’ rights extends deeper into the economic realm — particularly the workplace — than American liberalism’s does.","3480","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-democrats-need-both-clinton-and-sanders/2015/10/14/c64e944e-729f-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"The great irony of Northern European social democracy is that it has produced perhaps the world’s most successful capitalist economies. The Swedish full-employment policy that so intrigued Bill Clinton, for instance, made workers confident that they could get jobs with at least comparable pay if their companies failed, thereby eliminating popular resistance to shuttering moribund industries and incubating new ones. The German economy — by any measure the most successful of any advanced capitalist nation over the past decade — confers on employees considerable say in company policy by giving their representatives half the seats on corporate boards. It is also home to the world’s most successful small and medium-size businesses, the Mittelstand, the kind of small manufacturers whose numbers have diminished in the United States as Wall Street has pressured our big retailers and manufacturers to offshore their suppliers.","3481","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-democrats-need-both-clinton-and-sanders/2015/10/14/c64e944e-729f-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"The crucial distinction between Europe’s social democrats and the Democratic Party in the United States is that the former have institutionalized worker power to a far greater degree than have our Democrats, who are quintessentially a party of both capital and labor. This has mattered most particularly in the post-1970 era of globalization. While the major corporations of all Western nations have gone global, those in Northern Europe have, as a result of the power that workers wield, retained the best jobs in their home nations and still identify themselves with their home countries. The vast majority of U.S. corporations, by contrast, identify themselves as global, seem content to offshore jobs and don’t invest much, if anything, in training workers for highly skilled jobs here. That’s not because U.S. corporate chief executives are less patriotic than their European counterparts, but because social democratic parties have vested workers with the power to constrain corporate conduct, and crafted policies that favor their home nations’ economies through, for instance, increased public investment. They have limited the size and sway of finance, whose demand for profits accords no special status to the notion of a “home country.”","3482","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-democrats-need-both-clinton-and-sanders/2015/10/14/c64e944e-729f-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"All that said, both Sanders and Hillary Clinton favor extending Americans’ economic rights, as their support for policies such as paid family leave makes clear. Both favor economies with vibrant small businesses, which Sanders helped incubate when he was mayor of Burlington, Vt., and which is entirely consistent with social democratic theory and practice. Both favor constraining the economic and political power of banks, though Sanders clearly more so.","3483","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-democrats-need-both-clinton-and-sanders/2015/10/14/c64e944e-729f-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"The difference — the socialist difference, if you will — is that Sanders understands the inherent threat that Wall Street poses to the U.S. economy, and that bolstering worker power and rights has to become the Democrats’ defining mission in good times and bad. He also understands that the kind of movement his campaign is building is essential to realizing not just his “revolutionary” agenda, but Clinton’s “progressive” agenda as well. The great bursts of progressive reform in the 1930s and 1960s were the joint product of liberal presidents and turmoil in the streets — general strikes in the ’30s, civil rights protests in the ’60s. In the United States, liberalism advances only when radicalism is bubbling, which is why Clinton and Sanders need each other, and why the Democrats need them both.","3484","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-democrats-need-both-clinton-and-sanders/2015/10/14/c64e944e-729f-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

So, he becomes a figure aroud which a lot of white conservative Southern voters rallied.

The really big moment came with the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Johnson famously says, we have signed the South over the the Republican Party for the next generation and he was prescient. Get to the 1968 presidential election and LBJ [Johnson] steps aside. [Vice President Hubert] Humphrey steps in. Martin Luther King is killed. Robert Kennedy is killed.

But just as clearly, no one with any understanding of history would deny that in the '60s and certainly by the '70s, the two parties changed places, with the Democrats supporting civil rights expansion and Republicans taking on a kind of neo-Confederate stance.

"The fall budget battles will turn on the question of the spending level at which the government will be funded; Dems want Republicans to agree to new revenues as part of any budget deal, to help fund the government at a higher rate than the sequester-capped rate that many Republicans prefer (at least on non-defense spending; Republicans want to bust the caps on defense spending).","3630","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/16/how-democrats-will-use-trump-as-a-weapon-against-congressional-republicans/"

"Trump has not rolled out a tax plan, but he has vowed to raise taxes on “hedge fund guys.” Jeb Bush’s tax plan, meanwhile, nixes the loophole in which hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate on “carried interest,” i.e., profits on investments. Still, Jeb’s plan would result in a huge overall windfall for the wealthy, meaning it isn’t “populist” in any real sense.

However, the argument from Democrats that Republicans should follow Trump’s lead is more than just a one-off political stunt. (Schumer has previously supported ending the carried interest loophole.)

"With Congressional conservatives vowing to oppose any government funding measure that does not also defund Planned Parenthood — a nonstarter for Obama and Dems — Republicans appear likely to need Democratic help to pass anything that keeps the government open.

"Trump may end up proving unexpectedly useful in this regard. In vowing to raise taxes on the wealthy, Trump has claimed his rivals would all “continue to let Wall Street and the hedge fund guys rip off the people by paying no or very little in taxes.” In so doing, Trump may be ripping the mask off of the GOP’s ongoing “populist” makeover, revealing — from the vantage point of a billionaire insider who gets how the joke really works — that the GOP still remains committed to the same old supply-side dogma that requires the other GOP candidates to continue vowing to cut taxes for the rich.","3637","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/16/how-democrats-will-use-trump-as-a-weapon-against-congressional-republicans/"

"The hope among senior Democrats is that the rise of Trumpism could end up helping them press their fiscal arguments. As Ross Douthat has noted, it’s not inconceivable that the success of Trump’s brand of populism might lead Republicans to contemplate seriously reorienting themselves to being “less like a tool of moneyed interests,” rather than simply trying to find a way to destroy Trump without “adapting to his message.” If so, that could end up making it harder for Congressional Republicans to sustain their continued opposition to new revenues in the budget wars to come.

"By Democrats’ account, Gowdy and Cummings communicated fairly well when the Benghazi committee was created in spring 2014.

"In an example of their early cooperation, Gowdy asked Cummings to reach out to Clinton in late 2014 about testifying before the committee. Clinton accepted after Cummings’s request.

Instead, Democrats are pushing their own alternative proposal, which would tighten up loopholes in the Visa Waiver Program (through which people from some countries enter for a limited time without a visa), by blocking people from being eligible for it if they’ve visited Iraq or Syria in the last five years and improving information sharing in other ways.","3774","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/19/can-democrats-block-the-gop-bill-stalling-syrian-refugees/"
"If I understand this correctly, the basic idea is two-fold: This gives Senate Democrats something security-oriented to be for, allowing them to oppose the House bill, and it changes the subject from the refugees to what they view as a much more serious security threat. (This is actually what they believe on the substance; for more detail, see this Huffington Post article.) This also has the virtue of being supported by progressives such as Senator Chris Murphy and some Republicans.","3775","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/19/can-democrats-block-the-gop-bill-stalling-syrian-refugees/"
"The question is whether Democrats will remain united behind this proposal as an alternative to supporting the bill to impose stricter verification procedures on the Syrian refugees. It’s possible a number of Dems will want to be seen doing something about them. Remember, six Democrats have to support the GOP proposal for Republicans to break the Democratic filibuster, and if that happens, 13 Dems have to support it to override a presidential veto. Asked if it would even come to a veto battle, Reid said today: “Don’t worry, it won’t get passed. Next question?”","3776","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/19/can-democrats-block-the-gop-bill-stalling-syrian-refugees/"
"That may sound overly optimistic. But people with long memories will recall the widespread predictions to the effect that the politics of the Iran deal were so awful that Democrats would splinter, leading to a veto fight. That didn’t happen. Of course, now there’s been a terrorist attack (on another country), so maybe things will be different this time.","3777","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/19/can-democrats-block-the-gop-bill-stalling-syrian-refugees/"
"2) Will a long break cool everyone off? This is the big factor that no one is discussing: It’s a bit of fortuitous timing that the Senate is heading into Thanksgiving recess. That means it won’t address the House bill until the week after next. Democratic aides appear (somewhat) confident that public passions will subside sufficiently to allow Dems to push their alternative, thus bogging the debate down in Washington procedural mumbo jumbo and weakening the Republican position.","3778","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/19/can-democrats-block-the-gop-bill-stalling-syrian-refugees/"
"“The House vote took place in a perfect storm,” one senior Senate Democratic aide tells me. “That bill is peaking today. It’s all downhill from here.”","3779","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/19/can-democrats-block-the-gop-bill-stalling-syrian-refugees/"
"Of course, it’s also possible that Dems could find their constituents in a state of hyper-alarm for the next 10 days straight, requiring them to demonstrate their anti-terror prowess by standing up to the Syrian refugees and supporting the GOP bill in large enough numbers to override an Obama veto. But it’s not likely things will end quite like that, though the end of the story could still be troubling.","3780","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/19/can-democrats-block-the-gop-bill-stalling-syrian-refugees/"
"3) What sort of face-saving Rube Goldberg contraption might emerge? One possible endgame here is some kind of negotiated settlement. After all, even some Republicans say that the Visa Waiver Program may be a more pressing security threat than are the verification processes for entering Syrian refugees. So maybe a bipartisan solution could center on Visa Waver Program reforms, plus some kind of compromise around changes to the Syrian refugee program that are watered down enough to allow Obama and Democrats to support it (because they don’t effect a meaningful pause to the program), but also represent enough of a change to allow Republicans to claim they forced Dems to get serious about protecting the country already.","3781","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/19/can-democrats-block-the-gop-bill-stalling-syrian-refugees/"
"Because, after all, it does appear that there is strong bipartisan consensus behind the idea that Congress must be seen doing something about the Syrian refugees.","3782","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/19/can-democrats-block-the-gop-bill-stalling-syrian-refugees/"

"The three-part proposal — spearheaded by Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Center Chairman Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) — includes closing background check loopholes for Internet and gun show sales, expanding the background check database and cracking down on the illegal gun market, according to a letter to Senate colleagues obtained by The Washington Post.","3785","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/07/senate-democrats-preparing-gun-control-legislation/"

"The principles will reintroduce many of the universal background check proposals contained in the failed bipartisan legislation introduced in 2013 by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WestVa.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Just one of the four Democrats who voted against the bill, Sen.

"The plan is not expected to get much, if any, support from Republicans and may never receive a vote in the GOP-controlled Senate where 60 votes are needed for passage.

"In the first Democratic presidential debate, the five candidates — Hillary Rodham Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee — squared off in Las Vegas. The following is my take on the economics portion of the night.","October 14","3795","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"First, the obvious: The distance between these Democratic candidates on economic issues is infinitesimally minuscule compared to the difference between their agendas and that of Republicans. They were extremely critical of the extent of wealth accumulation by the richest families — families they would tax to meet their progressive agendas. They were unanimous in condemning Wall Street, banks, bankers, shadow banks and financial “engineers.” They even had a pretty robust debate about capitalism itself, in which Clinton got to the right of Sanders by admitting that sure, she was a capitalist, but one who wanted to “save capitalism from itself.”","3796","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"In this sense, inequality and financial excess played the role in the Democrat debate that immigration plays in the Republican debate. The difference is that the Democrats have a point.","3797","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"With that, full disclosure: I’ve long worked in D.C. Democratic economic circles, and though I regularly and roundly criticize and praise ideas from both sides of the aisle, my orientation is certainly closer to what was said on this stage regarding economic policy than what we’ve heard so far from the Republican candidates.","3798","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"And what a difference there is. Listening to the Republican candidates tout their tax cuts for those at the top of the scale and their spending cuts for those at the bottom, you’d quickly conclude that the problem with America is that the rich have too little and the poor have too much.","3799","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"Listening to the Democratic candidates, on the other hand, you get the sense that these are the economic problems they believe government should try to solve:","3800","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"—Inequality: GDP grows but working families struggle to keep up. Clinton made an important point on this. It’s one thing to raise the minimum wage, which they all appeared to support (though she supports going to $12 while Sanders and O’Malley want $15; Chafee and Webb didn’t speak on this point). But Clinton argued that their agendas must go further and reach struggling middle-class households, calling for investments in infrastructure and clean energy (a point with which others agreed). As I’ve written before, it’s harder to raise the median wage than the minimum wage.","3801","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"—College affordability: There were some nuanced differences between their plans. Relative to Sanders and O’Malley, Clinton wants students to have some financial skin in the game. One thing we clearly heard tonight was a role for government in helping students attend college without loading up on debt.","3802","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"—Balancing work and family: Mandated paid family leave was another strong agenda item. When a moderator pushed Clinton and Sanders to defend the issue in the face of Republican claims that it would hurt small businesses, they didn’t back down a bit but noted that both California and most advanced economies provide paid leave without hurting businesses.","3803","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"—Financial market reform: O’Malley came alive on this exchange, stressing a notable difference between him and front-runner Clinton: He wants to reinstate the Glass-Steagall banking legislation that places a firewall between investment banks and commercial banks. (Sanders shares that position.) Clinton believes the “too-big-to-fail” problem can be addressed without reinstating the firewall that was in place from the recession to the latter 1990s. It’s a good, substantive debate; my view is that contemporary financial markets are not vulnerable to size as much as to interconnectedness. Thus, even with Glass-Steagall in place, it is plausible that we’d still be in a position of having to bail out financial institutions.","3804","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"But the larger point is less these nuances than the distance between the Democrats and Republicans on these financial matters. If you believe that markets still need strong oversight, versus repealing Dodd-Frank, then you liked what you heard tonight.","3805","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"—Trade policy: I heard no love for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. In fact, the debate turned on whether Clinton was flip-flopping or evolving by opposing the deal she once touted as the “gold standard” of trade deals. She made a plausible case that she hasn’t liked the way the deal itself has evolved since she last looked in on it, but Jonathan Weisman at the Times notes that, if anything, the TPP has drifted left since then.","3806","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"—Health care: Bernie Sanders basically touts single-payer health care for all, pointing out that Denmark, Norway and Sweden provide such comprehensive social protections. Other candidates argued— fairly, I thought — that we’re not Scandinavia, but that there was more to do to ensure affordable coverage, including dealing with runaway drug costs.","3807","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"And there was more: criminal justice reform, profit sharing, a fairer tax system wherein the wealthy pay more (Clinton mentioned a middle-class tax cut, something I don’t think her campaign has trotted out yet), a tax on financial transactions, fees on over-leveraged banks, accountability on Wall Street by prosecuting people instead of institutions and reeling in the rise of money in politics by taking on the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court.","3808","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"The strong sense from these candidates on the economy, particularly Clinton, Sanders, and O’Malley, was that when it comes to raising the living standards of middle- and low-income families, the American economy has gone off course, and it will take extensive government action to get it back on track. Such actions would empower the least advantaged while holding those at the top of scale who’ve been disproportionately reaping the benefits of growth accountable, through regulation on finance and through higher taxes. Those revenues would be used to provide opportunities for the many of the wrong side of the inequality divide.","3809","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"The difficulty of getting that quite progressive agenda through Congress hardly came up; tonight seemed more about laying out the ideas and exploring some differences, though as I’ve noted, those were pretty minor. Still, I’d like to see more time spent on that question of implementation in later debates and I suspect I’m not alone. A number of good ideas were raised on that stage tonight. It would be useful to hear what the candidates think it takes for them to come to fruition.","3810","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"One final observation. I’m old enough to remember when Democratic candidates, including Clinton’s husband, were compelled to tack to the center in these debates. Bill Clinton pledged to “reform welfare,” not finance. What explains the leftward drift? I’d say it’s (a) decades of inequality, where “unstacking the deck,” as Hillary Clinton put it, or, in Sanders’ words, “going after the millionaires and billionaires,” is widely viewed as a necessary policy goal and (b) the rise of a diverse, multi-racial electorate that is legitimately insisting that their preferences (and their lives) matter.","3811","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/a-highly-progressive-economic-agenda-dominates-the-democrats-first-debate/"
"Vice President Biden might have missed his moment of opportunity. In a critical point in her campaign, Hillary Clinton arguably had the best night of her campaign. She was smooth and unflappable throughout. Her best moment was certainly her attack on Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for his voting five times against the Brady bill. More important, she received exoneration from Sanders on the e-mail scandal. Ironically, she was the least effective on foreign policy.","October 13","3812","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/13/the-democrats-open-their-debate-season/"
"She effortlessly evaded the question on her e-mails, reverting to her talking point that this is all a Republican partisan plot. She bragged that she is still “standing” and insisted that voters wanted to hear about bread-and-butter issues. Challenged that the FBI is not partisan and even the president conceded it is a legitimate issue, she again invoked the “Republican witch hunt” theme. Sanders rode to her defense, suggesting he does not have the will to draw blood. His strong support for her earned a standing ovation, and with that her vulnerability on the scandal is greatly diminished in the primary. The general election is another matter. She had a rousing riff on early education and the New Deal (!), making certain to show her liberal, pro-government bona fides to the base. Her insistence that the economy does better with Democrats again played well with the partisan audience. Her one weak moment on domestic matters came when she pleaded that all the candidates had changed on a “position or two” since they’d all been around so long. That’s a GOP campaign ad that writes itself. And claiming she “never took a position on Keystone until she took a position on Keystone” is likely to call her grief as well.","3813","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/13/the-democrats-open-their-debate-season/"
"She, however, did appear uncomfortable on foreign policy topics. She defended the Russian reset on the grounds Vladimir Putin was not in the presidency, a weak argument to put it mildly. Attacked on Iraq, she hid behind the president, citing his trust in her. (That works in a Democratic debate, but could prove deadly in a general election.) She was pummeled for being too aggressive on foreign policy by Sanders as well as former governors Martin O’Malley and and Lincoln Chafee. Former senator Jim Webb weighed in on Iran, citing that as encouragement for Iran and bad actors. She was forced to defend her role in Libya as “smart power at its best.” Left unsaid was the neglect that followed and the chaos that ensued.","3814","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/13/the-democrats-open-their-debate-season/"
"Indeed, Clinton’s area of “expertise” in both the primary and a general election is her biggest vulnerability. (Webb in his strong indictment of the Iran deal and declaration that China should not be allowed to control the South China Sea sounded more like a Republican.)","3815","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/13/the-democrats-open-their-debate-season/"
"Sanders was feisty, lauding his identity as a “democratic socialist” and condemning “casino capitalism.” His strongest moments came when he reminded the crowd he voted against the Iraq War. If Clinton was smooth, he was intense, reverting to his tell-tale shouting. His anti-interventionist stance and assurance that Putin will regret his aggression is in sync with the Democratic base. His defense of his conscientious objection to fighting in Vietnam and insistence that war should be the last resort got him cheers from the crowd. In his call for a “political revolution” and invectives aimed at corporate America, Sanders enlivens ultra-liberals, who are a larger share of the party than ever before.","3816","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/13/the-democrats-open-their-debate-season/"
"Neither O’Malley nor Chafee showed the verve to present themselves as a credible candidate. It’s unclear why they are in the race.","3817","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/13/the-democrats-open-their-debate-season/"
"Clinton should be pleased that she had no significant error and a few good moments. However, the debate made clear just how problematic her foreign policy record is. Sanders has his finger on the pulse on the left-wing Democratic base. He likely reinforced that appeal, which may be critical in traditionally anti-interventionist Iowa. One sensed, however, that he will need much more to topple Clinton — either further damaging revelations or some major slip on her part. He offers no olive branch to moderates in the party, which both limits his appeal and intensifies the affection of left-leaning true-believers.","3818","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/13/the-democrats-open-their-debate-season/"
"For now the dynamic of the race remains the same: Clinton is not seriously threatened at this point in the campaign. Unless Biden enters or more damaging information emerges, she is the clear favorite for the nomination. Republicans would be happy to face her — and her baggage. That said, they would be foolish to underestimate her. She can appear polished, knowledgable and reasonable. They will need a competent, plausible nominee to beat her.","3819","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/13/the-democrats-open-their-debate-season/"
"Finally, kudos to the CNN moderator Anderson Cooper and his colleagues. The questions were crisp, substantive and aggressive. Given the debate’s excessive length and lack of real fireworks, the audience is likely to be small. And that suits front-runner Clinton just fine.","3820","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/13/the-democrats-open-their-debate-season/"
"The news that Tea Party Republican Matt Bevin snatched the Kentucky governor’s mansion away from Democrats is a particularly stark reminder of how deep a hole Democrats have dug for themselves at the state level, and of the consequences that could have for the long-term success of the liberal and Democratic agenda.","November 4","3821","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/04/morning-plum-a-brutal-reality-check-for-the-democratic-party/"
"Bevin will replace Democratic governor Steve Beshear, who was perhaps the leading evangelist for the Affordable Care Act in the South. Beshear famously set up a Kentucky health insurance exchange and opted in to Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion amid a region of hostility towards the law. Bevin has pledged to transition people off of the exchange to the federal one, and to shut down the state’s Medicaid expansion. But in Kentucky, the law has succeeded at its primary goal: Early on it successfully brought health coverage to some of the state’s (and the country’s) poorest and unhealthiest counties, and Gallup found earlier this year that Kentucky boasted the second largest drop in the uninsured rate of any state in the country.","3822","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/04/morning-plum-a-brutal-reality-check-for-the-democratic-party/"
"Now those policy gains may be in some doubt. It remains to be seen how the state battle over rolling back Obamacare will play out or whether people will actually end up losing benefits. But the loss challenges Democrats’ assumption — one also touted on this blog — that they can win on hostile political turf by successfully demonstrating how government programs can help people and pointing out that Republicans will take all that away from them. As Dave Weigel notes, Beshear had explicitly said this.","3823","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/04/morning-plum-a-brutal-reality-check-for-the-democratic-party/"
"The loss could also impact another policy area, too: Climate change. Obama’s Clean Power Plan aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants by setting carbon reduction targets for states. They can try to hit those targets with their own plan, or the feds will step in and create one for them. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell is a major foe of the CPP. But in Kentucky, under Beshear, the state had actually been preparing to comply on its own. Now the Republican win raises the question of whether that will continue. It’s true that even if the state ends up not complying, the federal government will create a plan for it. But state compliance and participation might increase the odds of success.","3824","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/04/morning-plum-a-brutal-reality-check-for-the-democratic-party/"
"The broader point is that the Kentucky loss underscores once again that there are serious policy consequences to the profound deficit Democrats face on the level of the states. As I’ve reported, Democrats are well aware of this and are trying to something about it: it’s conceivable that by the end of this decade, the picture could look very different. But last night is a reminder of the stakes involved.","3825","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/04/morning-plum-a-brutal-reality-check-for-the-democratic-party/"

"2. Their major donors and top-tier staff talent have generally shown little inclination to fund or work on the low-profile fights for control of state legislatures.

"Nowhere in the DNC autopsy is it mentioned how the party plans to solve those fundamental problems. The party is planning to coordinate its efforts better, target key gubernatorial races and the like. And that's all well and good.

"“We’ve expressed our interest to the presidential campaigns, and we’ll be reaching out to Telemundo, given the Republican cancellation of the Telemundo debate, letting them know that Texas Democrats would like to host a forum with Telemundo and a number of other media partners,” Manny Garcia, the deputy executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, tells me.","3950","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/05/can-democrats-capitalize-on-gop-debate-chaos/"

"Now the Texas Democratic Party is offering to host such a forum.

"There are some signs that Republicans are sensitive to the bad publicity that might result if Republicans don’t end up doing their Telemundo debate, and Democrats end up doing one instead. After the news broke of talks between Telemundo and the DNC about a possible candidate forum, the Republican National Committee quickly clarified that it had only suspended the NBC/Telemundo debate, not cancelled it entirely, meaning it could still happen somehow.","3953","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/05/can-democrats-capitalize-on-gop-debate-chaos/"
"The logic of holding a Texas candidate forum broadcast on Telemundo is that Texas, which holds its primary on March 1st — Super Tuesday — dangles a massive delegate prize before the Democratic presidential candidates and has a very large Latino population. So it might be in the interests of the candidates to attend such an event.","3954","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/05/can-democrats-capitalize-on-gop-debate-chaos/"
"“We are the largest prize on Super Tuesday,” Garcia says. “We think Texas, with its over 20 media markets and a Latino population that is 40 percent of the state’s population, is a great place to get exposure.”","3955","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/05/can-democrats-capitalize-on-gop-debate-chaos/"
"Now, these talks are only preliminary, and it’s very possible this won’t end up happening. The candidates may decide they don’t want to take the time for a candidate forum out of their campaign schedules. What’s more, other complications could arise. It might be hard for Dems to agree to a candidate forum broadcast on Telemundo, because that might lead Univision, which has a larger reach, to feel it is being upstaged before the Univision debate on March 9th. And it’s also true that a candidate forum would not command the same size audience that a debate would.","3956","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/05/can-democrats-capitalize-on-gop-debate-chaos/"
"But you’d still think Democrats would try to make this happen, even if it requires a reshuffling of debate schedules to accommodate Univision’s concerns and an effort by the campaigns to find the time for it. Even if the event didn’t command as large an audience as a full-fledged debate, a second candidate gathering broadcast on Spanish-language network — replacing a Republican one — might get a lot of coverage in Spanish language media. And while Republicans did not suspend their NBC/Telemundo debate because of the Telemundo connection — they had many other reasons for doing so — Democrats could argue that the outcome shows that they are far more interested in reaching Latino voters than Republicans are.","3957","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/05/can-democrats-capitalize-on-gop-debate-chaos/"

She did not advocate for the restoration of a law dating to the Great Depression that prohibited firms from combining risky investment banking (the business that makes the big bucks on Wall Street) with ordinary retail banking (the business you do when you stop by the bank down the street).","3980","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/12/four-big-differences-between-the-leading-democratic-candidates-ahead-of-tuesdays-debate/"
"Clinton's husband repealed that law, known as the Glass-Steagall Act, during his presidency. It's one decision he made that his wife does not intend to reverse. Clinton's liberal critics say the end of Glass-Steagall was partly to blame for the recent financial crisis, a position that many Democratic economists reject. O'Malley and Sanders would ask Congress to reenact it, forcing major financial institutions to sell off desks doing business in the wrong category.","3981","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/12/four-big-differences-between-the-leading-democratic-candidates-ahead-of-tuesdays-debate/"

"Yet even without Glass-Steagall, some banks could be forced to downsize or reorganize under her proposal. If regulators thought a financial institution posed a risk to the economy, Clinton would give them the explicit authority to force the bank to make changes or break apart. She'd also impose a tax on debt owed by the largest banks to discourage them from taking on too much risk, with short-term, high-risk liabilities taxed at a higher rate. And the proposal indicated that Clinton could support requirements that large banks keep extra funds on their balance sheets as a kind of airbag in case of a crash.","3983","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/12/four-big-differences-between-the-leading-democratic-candidates-ahead-of-tuesdays-debate/"

"Clinton and O'Malley both argue for stricter gun control. Clinton would require not just customers at licensed gun dealerships to submit to a background check, according to a plan published by her campaign, but also some sellers doing business online or at gun shows. She would bypass Congress if necessary, using her executive authority as president if elected. She would also seek to give the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives more manpower and equipment to identify dealers who are abusing their federal licenses and supplying guns to the black market. And she'd make it a federal crime to buy a gun for someone who couldn't pass a background check on his own. Experts on gun violence say that many people get a hold of a firearm who wouldn't be able to pass a background check by asking their romantic partners or someone in their family to make what is known as a ""straw purchase.""","3986","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/12/four-big-differences-between-the-leading-democratic-candidates-ahead-of-tuesdays-debate/"
"O'Malley's proposal goes even further. He would require authorities to fingerprint anyone who wants to buy a gun, and he would make it illegal for any American under 21 to possess a handgun. He would set new federal standards for gun locks to prevent accidents at home, and he would establish a national registry of gun sales to make it easier for police to trace a weapon recovered at the scene of a crime to its owner.","3987","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/12/four-big-differences-between-the-leading-democratic-candidates-ahead-of-tuesdays-debate/"
"Both Clinton and O'Malley would repeal a law passed in 2005 giving firearms manufacturers immunity from the kind of lawsuits that consumers can bring against most companies when a product is unsafe. Legal experts disagree about what the law really means -- in any case, gunmakers can't be held liable for crimes committed with their weapons. It is one point of contrast between those two candidates and Sanders, who voted for the law and has stood against gun control at several important points in his career.","3988","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/12/four-big-differences-between-the-leading-democratic-candidates-ahead-of-tuesdays-debate/"
"In 1993, soon after his election to the House of Representatives, Sanders voted against the Brady bill, which first established the background-check system.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) said Clinton’s Wall Street donors must be expecting something from her, and called her plan for financial reform “not good enough.” The attack, coming from the famously hands-off Sanders, was enough that Clinton remarked that Sanders had “impugned my integrity.” She defended herself by suggesting that Wall Street bankers liked her mainly because she helped lower Manhattan rebuild after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.","3995","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-will-face-questions-shaped-by-paris-attacks-at-tonights-debate/2015/11/14/18059914-8a4b-11e5-be39-0034bb576eee_story.html"
"She also made a quip that could come back to haunt her: “I come from the ‘60s,” Clinton said, when starting a response to a question about protests on college campuses.

"The fix is in. No less then the leader of the Democratic Party — that is, the current president of the United States of America — has declared that the matter of Hillary Clinton’s home-brew server and e-mail escapades is political in nature and of no harm to national security. That is remarkable, given that any honest outside observer would not draw the same conclusion and that even many of the usual suspects in the media have been tempered in their efforts to vindicate Hillary Clinton. ‎Not to mention, just as President Obama essentially gave Clinton a get-out-of-jail-free card, it turns out that the FBI is actually expanding the scope of its probe to include possible violations of an Espionage Act provision that refers to gross negligence in handling classified information — a violation that could be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.","October 16","4061","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/10/16/democrats-protect-each-other-better-than-republicans-do/"
"While the president’s definitive declaration on “60 Minutes” that he didn’t think Hillary Clinton’s e-mail situation “posed a national security problem” reportedly “angered FBI agents” working the case, it’s not like the president hasn’t done this before. Remember his assertion that there was “not even a smidgen of corruption” regarding the IRS targeting scandal? Well, that scandal is also still being investigated — but conveniently for the president, the person in charge of that investigation is a partisan Democratic donor, Justice Department lawyer Barbara Bosserman. ‎I guess as long as the president’s former employee Lois Lerner continues to take the Fifth and Barbara Bosserman continues to be in the lead, the smidgens will stay locked out of sight. If the FBI didn’t get the message yesterday with the president’s direct order that the conclusion on Hillary’s e-mails should be that it “is not a situation in which America’s national security was endangered” and they get too close to the truth, maybe the White House will put Bosserman in charge of the e-mail investigation as well, just to make sure everything comes out the way the president wants it to.","4062","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/10/16/democrats-protect-each-other-better-than-republicans-do/"

It’s hard to imagine that Democrats somehow get attacked less over their support for the Iran deal in Scenario A. In this scenario, arguably the attacks on Dems could be more potent.

"It's the tale of Kodak, once a production and job-creation giant until it was, almost overnight, crushed under the wheels of the digital photography revolution. The centrist Democratic think tank Third Way offers the company's decline as a telling example of what's ailing America's stagnant middle class — and as a counter to the emerging liberal consensus that the rules of the economy have been ""rigged"" against workers in recent decades.","4101","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"The struggle of the middle class is ""not because the economy is unfair or because the deck was stacked,"" says Jim Kessler, Third Way's senior vice president for policy. ""It's because the economy has fundamentally changed.""","4102","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"The difference there is crucial, for policy and for messaging. One side believes what's gone wrong for the middle class is that wealthy and powerful players have rewritten the tax code, trade deals, labor law and other policies in order to advantage themselves, at the expense of workers. Middle-class stagnation, in this view, is a choice that can be corrected by shifting power back to workers, at the bargaining table and elsewhere.","4103","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"The other side, the Third Way side, believes that the stagnation is a natural consequence of a globalizing economy, which has disproportionately benefited people with high skills and people who own stock, businesses and other forms of capital. That's the story Kodak is meant to represent. Its demise wasn't imposed by someone else's policy choice, it was a failure of the company to adapt. To boost the middle-class, by that logic, workers need to be given the means to adapt.","4104","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"This is a live and sometimes acrimonious debate in the Democratic Party. It is a debate between populists, such as Sens.

"Right now the populist story is winning in the party. Among the three remaining major Democratic candidates for president — Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley — there is broad consensus that the nation's economic power dynamic has shifted to disadvantage working families. The party has placed widening income inequality at the top of its economic agenda.","4107","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"Sanders, in particular, blames inequality and middle-class stagnation on policies deliberately pushed by the wealthy and big corporations. His proposals to counter those trends include large expansions of government programs and regulations, such as massive infrastructure spending to create jobs, higher taxes on the rich, a $15-an-hour nationwide minimum wage and single-payer health care.","4108","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"Clinton, who is more moderate than Sanders and the front-runner in the race, has embraced much of Sanders' rhetoric — and she's moved close to him on key policy areas. These are all wins for populists, and for the liberal economists who are pushing the idea that the rules of the economy must be de-rigged, if you will, for the middle class to thrive again.","4109","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"The Third Way report released Tuesday — ""Ready for the New Economy"" — pushes back against that populism. It starts by asserting that populist arguments about rules and fairness have been losers for Democrats in recent elections. It also says populist prescriptions won't work to restore middle class prosperity.","4110","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"The reports notes that Kodak ""was not undone by economic unfairness,""but by economic changes. To get the economy working again for the middle class, the group says, workers must be given access to better skills, more jobs and more mechanisms to build wealth. The system doesn't need to be overhauled, in other words. Workers just need better help to thrive in it.","4111","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"

"Third Way argues for some things that make government bigger (though it would pay for new programs through other savings and limits to tax deductions that benefit the rich. Mostly it argues for making government better — and making government spending do a better job of spurring private investment.","4114","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"There is, for example, a $400 billion ""strategic investment initiative"" focused on infrastructure and research. There are efforts to improve education at every level. There's a higher minimum wage, but not a blanket one for the country - how high depends on where you live. There's a mandate for companies to divert 50 cents an hour from every worker's paycheck and put it in a retirement fund, in hopes of giving every America a larger chunk of capital. There's an increase in the top capital gains tax rate to pay for economic development in low-income areas across the country.","4115","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"
"The platform will almost certainly be criticized by some other Democrats as too timid and too corporate. Ultimately, the argument, at least in the short term, will have a single arbiter: the party's 2016 nominee, which Third Way assumes will be Clinton. The group's leaders acknowledge she's grown more populist in her rhetoric since she last ran for president eight years ago. But they note she hasn't endorsed the $15 an hour federal minimum wage or the Sanders health care plan, and they hope that means she'll tack back their way in a general election.","4116","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/theres-actually-a-big-economic-fight-happening-in-the-democratic-party/"

And despite Sanders's ability to energize the Democratic base -- as shown by huge crowds turning out to see him -- Clinton's edge is almost as large on intensity; 47 percent see Clinton in a ""strongly favorable"" light, compared with 22 percent for Sanders.

By contrast, 65 percent chose Clinton and 14 percent opted for Joe Biden -- even though he's not actually running just yet. Isolate just self-described liberals -- who comprise Sanders's base -- in that same poll and the result doesn't change much; 67 percent name Clinton as the party's most likely nominee while 13 percent chose Sanders and 12 percent Biden.","4170","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/20/democrats-like-bernie-sanders-they-just-dont-think-he-can-win/"

The best way to convince people that you can win is to, well, actually win something; New Hampshire looks like Sanders's best chance to do that but that's not until February.

"FBI Director James Comey has made two recent speeches where he warns us there is an emerging trend of police officers standing down or demonstrating reluctance to engage criminals because they are worried about sparking a situation similar to the riots in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore. Comey’s comments do not fit the Obama administration’s narrative on crime, and drew criticism from civil rights activists, law enforcement unions and the White House. Well, what do these groups have in common? That’s easy — they’re almost all Democrats, and they may be going down a slippery slope of promoting policies that have the effect of being pro-crime and anti-gun at the same time. Calling Democrats “pro-crime” may sound a tad harsh, but if you are for inhibiting police activity, causing fewer arrests and making mass releases from prison, what else would you call it? The politics of this issue are not fully formed, but if the Democrats don’t watch it, they run the risk of being the “pro-crime” party in the United States.

As you look around the world and see the turmoil abroad and listen to the FBI director at home, nothing seems safer. In the RealClearPolitics polling average, 53 percent of Americans disapprove of Obama’s handling of foreign policy. A recent Gallup poll showed a plurality of 46 percent of Americans think there is more local crime today than there was one year ago. And instead of finding the root cause or showing true leadership, Obama fixates on gun control and making it harder for law-abiding Americans to have guns. In fact, he gave yet another speech today calling for gun control. Meanwhile, a Gallup poll published last week revealed that 56 percent of Americans believe that if “more Americans carried concealed weapons … the country would be safer.” And in the latest Post/ABC News poll, 63 percent of Americans “blame mass shootings on failed mental health treatment [rather than on] inadequate gun control.”","4205","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/10/27/the-insiders-the-fbi-director-is-saying-something-the-democrats-need-to-hear/"

"With calls for more Democratic presidential primary debates mounting, Democratic National Committee chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz today brought the hammer down: There will be six debates and not a single one more!","September 10","4232","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"“We’re having six debates — period,” the Florida congresswoman said today, per Jennifer Epstein’s report. “We’re having six debates and the candidates will be uninvited from any subsequent debates if they accept an invitation to a debate outside the six DNC-sanctioned debates.”","4233","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"Wasserman Schultz added that six debates was just the right amount for voters to see a lot of interaction between the candidates without constraining their campaign schedules. “The purpose of it is so we can make sure that the Democratic Party’s debate process doesn’t get out of control,” she said, dismissing charges that the schedule is designed to rig the process for Hillary Clinton by limiting exposure of challengers Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley.","4234","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"Yet the arguments against Wasserman Schultz continue to gain traction. If there is a good counter-argument to the case being made by those who want more debates, I haven’t heard it yet.","4235","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"One key argument for more debates making the rounds among Dems is that the current schedule may result in too few Dem primary voters tuning in, at exactly the moment when it would be most useful for Democrats to be drawing a sharp contrast with Republicans. Four of the six Dem debates are currently scheduled, for October 13, November 14, December 19, and January 17th (two more are set for February or March but are not scheduled yet).","4236","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"“Three of the four scheduled debates are on weekends,” Deb Kozikowski, the northeast vice president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, tells me. “One is the weekend between Hannukah and Christmas; the other falls on Martin Luther King Day weekend. You can’t expect that we’re going to generate a whole lot of excitement and interest in these candidates.”","4237","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"The Hillary campaign has said it hopes to wrap up the nomination by March 1st or March 15th, by which date many of the states, including big ones, will have voted. If that does happen, the whole primary schedule will have been very front-loaded and compressed early in the season. By contrast, in 2008, the Democratic primary went on for many, many months, into June — giving the candidates far more exposure to not just Democratic primary voters, but to the American people more broadly. More debates might help offset that, as Dem strategist Simon Rosenberg has pointed out in his suggestion of fixes.","4238","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"What’s more, between the start of the new year, when voters start tuning in, and March 15th, the Republican primary season may well hit maximum carnival mode — particularly since it’s now looking like Donald Trump will be with us for the foreseeable future. Some Dems think that this is exactly the moment when the Democratic candidates should be on the air as much as possible, engaging in a sober discussion of issues that contrasts well with Trump-palooza.","4239","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"Depending on when those last two unscheduled Dem debates are set (if, for instance, they are set after March 15th), there could conceivably be only one Dem debate between January and the end of the primary. The maximum would be three. Republicans have at least five — and those will likely get huge audiences.","4240","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"“My concern is that not enough people will see the Democrats, while on the other side of the aisle, they’re putting on the Greatest Show on Earth,” Kozikowski of the Association of State Democratic Chairs tells me. “That just wipes us off the map. It doesn’t make any sense to let the opposition own the airwaves. The majority of my colleagues don’t feel much differently. We are advocating a full and complete discussion of issues among our candidates, whom we believe are far superior to the Greatest Show on Earth.”","4241","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"The infighting over this is getting contentious. Evan McMorris-Santoro reports that some top party officials feel their concerns about the debate schedule are not being heeded by the DNC. And two DNC vice-chairs — Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and former Minneapolis mayor R.T. Rybak — took the unusual step of posting their objections to the schedule on Facebook. They concluded:","4242","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"
"Meanwhile, Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has proposed far-reaching voting reforms and a new scheme of federal matching funds for small contributions. Both of those are designed to maximize participation in the process — a goal Clinton has leaned into with moral urgency. Against that backdrop, it seems infelicitous for Democrats to be embroiled in a very public fight in which party leaders are increasingly being accused of limiting the exposure of the candidates to voters.","4243","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/10/the-case-for-more-democratic-debates/"

"The first Democratic debate of the 2016 election is Tuesday night in Las Vegas. It was long expected to be the official kickoff for the coronation of Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee.

"""The Democrats enter the post-Obama phase in a way that is similar to how the Republicans entered the post-Reagan era,"" said Dan Pfeiffer, a longtime senior adviser to Obama.

"Of course, a two-hour debate isn't likely to answer all of these questions — or perhaps any of them.

"At the center of that conversation — and this debate — is, of course, Clinton. Clinton has staked out a series of liberal positions of late on things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (she's opposed to it) and the Keystone XL pipeline (she's opposed to building it), but generally, seems to be cut from a similar political mold as her husband: a relentless pragmatist, not a dyed-in-the-wool liberal true-believer. That's especially true on foreign policy, where Clinton has said she supports a no-fly zone in Syria, a step opposed by, among others, Obama and Bernie Sanders.","4252","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-fight-for-the-future-of-the-democratic-party-starts-tuesday-night/"
"Sanders represents a considerable contrast to the cautious and centrist policy approach typically favored by Clinton. He is unapologetically liberal about his view of the world, arguing that Democrats have, for too long, been willing to accept a half-loaf rather than pushing for the full one. Sanders also puts economic inequality at the center of virtually every issue he talks about, arguing that the gap between the rich and everybody else is the defining issue of our time and should be what Democrats talk about first, second and third.","4253","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-fight-for-the-future-of-the-democratic-party-starts-tuesday-night/"
"The Sanders candidacy also represents a not-so-subtle rejection of the sort of politics that have been described for the better part of the last two decades as ""Clintonian."" Sanders is, in some ways, what liberals thought they were getting when they chose Obama over Clinton in 2008 — a politician who says what he believes, damn the consequences. Someone who wears the ""liberal"" (and even ""socialist"") label proudly. Someone who is willing to make people — including those in his own party — uncomfortable in trying to achieve a liberal vision of what the federal government can and should do.","4254","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-fight-for-the-future-of-the-democratic-party-starts-tuesday-night/"
"Aside from pure policy disagreements, that contrast is also a stylistic and tonal one. Sanders's great strength in this race — and what has fueled much of his rise to date — is his authenticity. If you were creating the perfect candidate, you would create someone who looked and sounded like John Edwards. You would not create Sanders, a wild-haired, often-ornery, self-described democratic socialist who represents Vermont, a unique state if there ever was one. How Sanders looks and how he sounds (an incredibly strong Brooklyn accent) screams ""authentic."" He is not the sort of person the Democratic Party has nominated in the recent past and, most importantly, he is not a Clinton — and all that being one represents.","4255","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-fight-for-the-future-of-the-democratic-party-starts-tuesday-night/"
"Electing Clinton would likely be a return to the politics and policy that defined her husband's administration. In 2008, Democratic voters rejected that option in favor of a candidate promising a new approach — one that was defined by a more congenial and collaborative attitude toward governance. But there's no one in Washington — including Obama — who can reasonably claim that his ""new"" approach worked or changed anything meaningful in Washington.","4256","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-fight-for-the-future-of-the-democratic-party-starts-tuesday-night/"
"So what's the right next step for Democrats? Do they return to the ways of the Clintons because of the track record of success Bill (and Hillary) Clinton built up? Or do they take another detour — this one far further off the beaten path than the one Obama represented in 2008 — to re-orient the party in the new normal of deep polarization politically, vast inequality economically and broad-scale uncertainty in foreign policy?","4257","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-fight-for-the-future-of-the-democratic-party-starts-tuesday-night/"

"Nine Democrats trying frantically to dispel the impression that their party was sold a bill of goods on the Iran deal came out with legislation Thursday that they said would “strengthen U.S. policy toward Iran and to clarify aspects of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that is set to take effect.” It does nothing of the sort. “Completely toothless” is how one critic of the Iran deal put it. Moreover, in putting forth legislation trying to back-fill what President Obama gave away in the deal, they only highlight the deal’s infirmities and confirm that supporters were motivated by partisanship, not support for the substance of the deal.","October 2","4259","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/02/democrats-look-for-cover-on-lousy-iran-deal/"

They should also pass, now, new sanctions against Iran for detaining Americans, supporting Bashar al-Assad, supplying terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, human rights violations and promoting regional instability in Yemen, among other places.

"The majority leader reversed himself and apologized repeatedly to Gowdy, but the damage seemed irreparable, particularly after two more developments. First, a former Republican staffer with the Benghazi committee, Bradley Podliska, accused his former colleagues of focusing exclusively on Clinton rather than conducting a comprehensive investigation. Then, a rank-and-file Republican lawmaker, Rep. Richard Hanna (N.Y.), said that Gowdy’s investigation was “designed to go after” Clinton.","4390","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/21/democrats-embrace-offense-on-benghazi-ahead-of-clinton-hearing/"

"“I have told my own Republican colleagues and friends, ‘Shut up talking about things that you don’t know anything about.’ Unless you’re on the committee, you have no idea what we have done, why we have done it and what new facts we have found,” Gowdy said during an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation.”","4392","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/21/democrats-embrace-offense-on-benghazi-ahead-of-clinton-hearing/"

"First, the Central Intelligence Agency contradicted Republicans’ claim that the identity of a CIA source sent in one of Clinton’s e-mails was classified.

"Second, Gowdy’s staff appeared to accidentally publish the CIA source’s name online after Gowdy said its release could could jeopardize “not only national security but human lives.” The name was quickly taken down, and staffers blamed an error by the State Department.","4395","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/21/democrats-embrace-offense-on-benghazi-ahead-of-clinton-hearing/"
"And third, The Washington Post reported that Gowdy has past ties to the treasurer of the Stop Hillary PAC, which created a Benghazi-themed attack ad that ran against Clinton during the first Democratic primary debate. The treasurer, Dan Backer, also handles finances for three other PACs that each contributed $2,000 to Gowdy in May. Gowdy returned the donations on Friday after an inquiry by The Post.","4396","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/21/democrats-embrace-offense-on-benghazi-ahead-of-clinton-hearing/"

"The immediate answer: He remains an underdog candidate for the Democratic nomination.

"In a time of economic insecurity and an anti-establishment mood among so many voters here and elsewhere, the unexpected is no longer unthinkable.

"Here and in Britain, a political evolution continues. The election of Corbyn represents a dramatic break with the recent history of the Labour Party, a full and conspicuous rejection of the New Labour philosophy of Tony Blair, the former prime minister who won three successive elections but who now is a reviled figure for his role in prosecuting the war in Iraq in partnership with former president George W. Bush.","4422","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sanders-corbyn-and-the-coming-debate-inside-the-democratic-party/2015/09/12/a23673f4-597e-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html"
"To American audiences, it is difficult to overstate the degree to which Blair is now an outcast in British politics. He may retain some affection here in the United States, but not in Britain.

"Blair weighed in days after the general election, warning that Labour had veered too far left under Miliband and that the road back to power required the party to recapture the center ground it had held from 1997 until 2010.

"Corbyn advocates a return to the kind of policies — nationalization of some industries, withdrawal from NATO — that had decimated the party decades earlier and brought Margaret Thatcher to power.

"Blair was not operating in a vacuum as he sought to modernize his party during the Thatcher era in Britain. Bill Clinton was doing the same thing in the United States in an effort to restore the Democrats to power during the Reagan era.

"Both acknowledged the vulnerabilities of their own parties, adapted to the more conservative views of the electorates of the time — on crime and welfare, for example — and put a relentless focus on middle-class economics.

"Although Democrats have suffered humiliating defeats in two midterm elections in that time, they have not been faced with the kind of back-to-basic question about their philosophy and policies that Miliband’s defeat and resignation triggered there.

"Corbyn’s critics were describing his victory Saturday as a catastrophe for the Labour Party, a development that could relegate one of the two major parties to the fringes.

If that constituency is overwhelmingly in favor of putting a halt to Syrian refugees entering the country, it is both good representation and savvy politics to at least hear that point of view. Democrats may not understand that because their elected officials and their base feel as though this is, at heart, a moral issue. But remember that it's easy to claim morality when there are no political consequences for doing so.","4502","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/republican-voters-dont-want-to-let-syrian-refugees-in-what-should-gop-politicians-do/"

"In other words, there is true diversity, the diversity of ideas. There is also racial, gender, age and professional diversity. The debates have been remarkably substantive, more so than any primary debate I can recall. The candidates have challenged one another and the moderators have tried to pit one candidate against another, properly so. This is a debate, after all, not an infomercial for one candidate or even the party. Conflict means excitement; excitement means viewers.

"The Democrats, however, likely will walk on egg shells. Clinton will claim all her troubles are part of a “right-wing conspiracy” and her opponents will likely say it’s up to the voters to decide.

"As Senate Democrats try to shield the president from the need to veto an overwhelming vote of disapproval on his Iran deal, their political predicament worsens. A new Pew Research Center poll shows: “As Congress prepares to vote on the Iran nuclear agreement, public support for the deal has declined. Currently, just 21% approve of the agreement on Iran’s nuclear program reached between the United States, Iran and other nations. Nearly half (49%) disapprove of the agreement, while three-in-ten (30%) offer no opinion.” Less than a quarter of Americans approve but the president intends to either veto or put Senate Democrats up to filibustering a vote of disapproval that is entirely in line with that expressed public opinion.","September 9","4556","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/09/senate-democrats-vs-voters-on-iran/"
"The more President Obama talks about it and the more the public learns about the deal, the less they like it: “Over the past six weeks, the share approving of the agreement has fallen 12 percentage points (from 33% to 21%), while disapproval has held fairly steady (45% then, 49% now). . . . When opinion about the Iran nuclear agreement is based only on those who have heard a lot or a little about the agreement, opposition to the agreement exceeds support by more than a two-to-one margin (57% to 27%).”","4557","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/09/senate-democrats-vs-voters-on-iran/"
"Even Democrats like the deal less than they initially did. “While the partisan divide over the nuclear agreement remains substantial, support for the deal has slipped across the board since July. Currently, 42% of Democrats approve of the agreement, while 29% disapprove and an identical percentage has no opinion. In July, 50% of Democrats approved, 27% disapproved and 22% had no opinion.”","4558","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/09/senate-democrats-vs-voters-on-iran/"
"No wonder the Democrats want to avoid a vote directly on the merits. Unlike opponents, they seem deathly afraid the public will find out their true positions. But, of course, that makes the situation even more precarious for them. “If ever an issue deserved a full debate and an up-or-down vote, this disastrous deal with Iran qualifies. The Senate has already voted overwhelmingly to have such a vote,” said David Brog, executive director of Christians United for Israel, the largest pro-Israel group in the United States, with more than 2 million members. “It ‘s now time for the Democrats to hold up their end of the bargain and to live up to their responsibilities to their constituents. It’s time for each senator to take a stand the most momentous issue of our time.

"Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), co-author of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, issued a measured statement rebuking Democrats. “With 98 senators on the record voting in support of the legislation, I am very disappointed that some members on the other side of the aisle are reversing their positions and now are threatening to filibuster to keep the Senate from voting on this consequential agreement with Iran.”","4560","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/09/senate-democrats-vs-voters-on-iran/"

"One can understand how difficult it might be to insist there be no vote after 60 days of heated public discussion and long written statements explaining their vote. Senators like Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who supported the deal with a bizarre written statement reviewing at length all its infirmities. His constituents’ irate reaction to his decision to vote for the deal have necessitated fence-mending meetings. What does he tell them — ‘And by the way I’m not going to allow anyone to really vote on this‘ ? With a large Jewish constituency and New Jersey’s other Democrat, Sen. Robert Menendez (D), the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying he will vote against the Iran deal, Booker may have permanently injured his political prospects. But what about Senate Democrats on the ballot in 2016? Aside from defending a deal the public dislikes overwhelmingly, Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) will find it difficult to defend ducking the vote altogether.","4562","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/09/senate-democrats-vs-voters-on-iran/"
"What has become apparent during this is that the Senate Democrats’ priority is a partisan defense of the White House. Whether refusing to take a sanctions vote in 2014 or trying to avoid a vote now, their prime objective has been to circle the wagons for a failing president at the end of his term. They’ve been unable to defend their position except to say (falsely) that the choice is this deal is war. And now their leadership expects them to look ridiculous (they did vote to demand Congress get a vote) simply to spare the president the need to exercise his veto. Democrats don’t seem to feel an obligation to listen to voters, or even cast a vote, on this critical issue. Maybe voters will conclude it is better to keep the Republicans in the majority (at least they take votes on the merits) and replace Democrats who think the Senate should be nothing more than a political rubber stamp for the president.","4563","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/09/senate-democrats-vs-voters-on-iran/"
"UPDATE: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), always seeking to make a name for himself and trash GOP leadership, just rose on the Senate floor to demand his leadership oppose cloture on the grounds the president has not submitted all the documents to Congress under Corker-Cardin, a bill he opposed. This is a singular act of betrayal of anti-Iran forces who have been fighting for a big bipartisan vote of disapproval. That is exactly what the White House fears, and it is therefore trying to cajole Democrats into a filibuster. An incensed official at a pro-Israel group tells Right Turn, “Nothing many of the supporters of the deal would like better than not being forced to cast a vote on an accord that is overwhelmingly opposed by the American people. If you loathe the deal, the only course of action is to demand an up or down vote on the resolution of disapproval.” He blasts the Cruz maneuver: “Otherwise, you are enabling the deal’s supporters to evade accountability.”","4564","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/09/senate-democrats-vs-voters-on-iran/"

"Democrats and climate advocates have thus far failed miserably in their quest to make the accelerating risk of immense future human suffering and dislocation something that sufficiently motivates voters.

"Today billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer is sending a memo to CNN’s Anderson Cooper, the moderator of the first Democratic presidential debate on October 13th, urging him to devote as much of the debate as possible to climate change and clean energy issues, and to try to force the Dem candidates to be more specific about their proposals.","4611","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/29/voters-dont-care-that-much-about-climate-change-democrats-should-talk-about-it-anyway/"

"In other words, climate and energy issues are an increasingly consequential area in which party doctrine is taking shape.

"Whether or not climate and clean energy will motivate voters, discussion of these issues in the high profile setting of a Dem debate would make for a compelling contrast with Republicans. At their debate, Republicans remained trapped in a feedback loop where it is now permissible to allow that climate change may be real, but it remains a requirement to assert that whatever Obama proposes to do about it would only destroy the American economy, and to maintain that American action would be futile at any rate, since whatever steps China is said to be taking don’t actually exist.","4614","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/29/voters-dont-care-that-much-about-climate-change-democrats-should-talk-about-it-anyway/"

"The thing is, a confluence of factors that are new to this cycle just might conspire to make it a bit harder to sustain that position. As Steyer notes, there is the Pope’s advocacy and the new existence of the Clean Power Plan, which requires states to set up plans to meet targets for reducing carbon emissions or accept a federal plan. It might be easy for the GOP presidential candidates to tell GOP primary voters that they’ll do all they can to undermine or cancel the plan — after all, Obama talks about it as important, so it must be unspeakably horrible — but that might be a tougher case to make to a general election audience.","4616","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/29/voters-dont-care-that-much-about-climate-change-democrats-should-talk-about-it-anyway/"
"What’s more, by the time the voting starts in the GOP primaries, we may have a global climate deal. Presumably the Republican candidates will feel compelled to pledge to withdraw the United States from any such deal, which will suddenly ratchet up the real-world stakes — the global stakes — of GOP opposition to climate action. That might also be a tough stance to maintain in a general election.","4617","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/29/voters-dont-care-that-much-about-climate-change-democrats-should-talk-about-it-anyway/"
"The more Democrats talk about this stuff, the more there is at least a chance that this contrast will impress itself in some kind of meaningful way on voters. When candidates and/or elected officials talk about issues, it can make a difference, generating more media coverage that can help set the political agenda over time. And Dem primary voters do deserve to know more specifics about the contenders’ solutions: this would help further develop party doctrine on the issue; and promises made by candidates often are kept once in office.

"The comment was odd in part because it echoed remarks made by Mitt Romney in 2012 that prompted a strong backlash. It's similar to Romney's famous ""47 percent"" remarks, but also, as our Sean Sullivan notes, is precisely the language Romney used at a separate fundraising event that year. Even if Bush thinks that the Democrats win votes by giving ""free stuff"" to black voters, it's not a smart thing to say.","4621","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/25/why-jeb-bushs-free-stuff-argument-about-black-voters-is-so-off-the-mark/"

Her problem — both in 2008 and at the start of this campaign — is that some element of liberals believed she is not truly one of them even while they largely liked her and thought she would do a good job as president.

"AMidwestern humorist, Indiana’s Kin Hubbard, said people often confuse bad management with destiny. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel knows better.

"During the past 84 years, the growth of the public sector has been mostly driven by the alliance between elected politicians and public-sector unions.

"It is not Emanuel’s fault that Chicago’s three largest employers, after the federal government, are the public school system, the city government and Cook County’s government.

"A circle with a radius of 275 miles from Chicago’s Loop includes nine Big Ten campuses (and the University of Chicago, the University of Notre Dame and many others) that furnish a steady stream of graduates drawn to urban life.

"The vast swath of Chicago known as the “bungalow belt” reflects the city’s tradition of homeownership. However, more than 20 percent of Chicago homeowners owe more than their houses are worth. In the Great Recession, Illinois had the nation’s third-highest foreclosure rate. Nevertheless, pensions will now be funded in part by a huge property-tax increase. The levy, of more than half a billion dollars, will be made progressive by exempting property below the median ($250,000) value. And approximately 25 percent of the tax will be paid from the thriving downtown business district. Although Cook County has until recently been losing more affluent residents than it has been attracting, Emanuel is working to reverse this wealth subtraction.","4668","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rahm-emanuel-reaps-the-whirlwind-of-democratic-rule/2015/10/14/2bad09d2-71d4-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"The world is indeed wonderfully out of joint when Emanuel, the embodiment of pugnacious progressivism, is proud, and properly so, of the booming market for downtown residences. This is evidence of increasing numbers of affluent people, including many young workers, who are weary of ever-longer commutes on ever-more-congested freeways. Traditionally, the only things true-blue progressives dislike more than suburbs are suburbanites who, not knowing their place, become gentrifying urbanites.

"Although Emanuel may not know this, he is trying to reverse what has been called (in a 2002 essay by Harvard economists Edward Glaeser and Andrei Shleifer) “the Curley effect.” James Michael Curley was Boston’s four-term mayor intermittently from 1914 to 1950, and apart from his five months in prison. He built his power base by taxation and redistribution policies that drove away the affluent, making the city’s low-income population a larger percentage of the electorate and increasingly dependent on government.","4670","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rahm-emanuel-reaps-the-whirlwind-of-democratic-rule/2015/10/14/2bad09d2-71d4-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"2. No Democratic rival really wants to cross Clinton. The toughest critic of Clinton on that stage was CNN moderator Anderson Cooper, and many of his questions to her were soft-pedaled.

"But if Cooper wasn’t too tough on Clinton, her fellow candidates were even nicer, no matter what David Francis and John Hudson claim in Foreign Policy. Her most important challenger gave her political cover on the e-mail question. None of the candidates called Clinton out on her Trans-Pacific Partnership flip-flop. Her most effective debate moment was responding to Lincoln Chafee’s milquetoast critique by stating that she didn’t feel the need to respond. She was right, too.","4679","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/14/five-quick-hits-on-last-nights-democratic-debate/"

"The biggest problem, unions say, is the low penalties employers face for intimidating or retaliating against workers who try to organize. Companies can effectively kibosh a union drive by firing its leaders, knowing that it might take months for the National Labor Relations Board to do anything about it.

"While Democratic leaders are being careful not to implore Obama directly to cut Congress out of his decision-making process, they are giving the president ample political cover to use executive authority to shutter the controversial detention facility.","4773","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/11/democrats-hint-they-are-ready-for-obama-to-shut-down-gitmo-alone/"
"“This president, time and again, has said that he wants to do everything in his power to close Guantanamo before he leaves. The Republicans in congress continue to do everything in their power to stop it,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the Senate’s second-ranking Democrat, on Tuesday. “I think there reaches a point where Congress is just being stubborn. They are just opposing everything he suggests, and he has to make decisions in the best interests of the country, and I think closing Guantanamo is one of them.”","4774","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/11/democrats-hint-they-are-ready-for-obama-to-shut-down-gitmo-alone/"

"“Congress has done their job.

"Republicans have spent the last week sounding the alarm that Obama’s tardiness delivering a plan to Congress suggests the president is trying to make an end-run around them and close the detention facility through executive order. GOP members have decried the anticipated move as unconstitutional, illegal, and disrespectful of Congress’ rightful role in determining Guantanamo’s future – a future they’d like to see preserved for a long time.","4781","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/11/democrats-hint-they-are-ready-for-obama-to-shut-down-gitmo-alone/"

"Many Democrats support shuttering Guantanamo and transferring detainees to facilities in the U.S. – even when those facilities could be in their backyards. Durbin, for example, supports the idea of bringing detainees to the U.S., even though many of them might end up at a top-security prison in his home state of Illinois.","4783","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/11/democrats-hint-they-are-ready-for-obama-to-shut-down-gitmo-alone/"

"Democrats and the White House are currently locking horns over whether the administration can carry out a campaign against the Islamic State under what many Democrats consider a defunct congressional authorization. Republicans, meanwhile, have been joyously pointing to a federal appeals court decision blocking an executive order on immigration, predicting a similar action to close Guantanamo would meet the same fate.","4785","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/11/democrats-hint-they-are-ready-for-obama-to-shut-down-gitmo-alone/"

"Clinton holds large leads over Biden on all of these issues. It has been widely suggested that Biden might be able to draw a contrast with Clinton on foreign policy in particular, since he is in some ways less hawkish than she is. Yet Clinton leads Biden on this issue by 62-20, perhaps undercutting how much that would matter (though I would add that a Biden challenge in this regard would be a very good thing for the quality of the Dem primary debate).

"Major caveat: this is only one poll, and Clinton has been talking about the issues on the campaign trail for many months, and Biden hasn’t. If he were to enter, all these numbers on policy likely would change. Still, they raise at least the possibility that there may not be any clear policy lane for Biden to distinguish himself from Clinton.","4792","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/19/morning-plum-among-democrats-hillary-leads-bernie-and-biden-on-all-the-issues/"
"It’s also notable that Clinton leads Sanders on the economy and income inequality (though on this one issue he’s much closer to her), given that the core of Sanders’ challenge is that his agenda to combat inequality is significantly more robust than hers, and more in sync with the scale of the structural economic challenges we face.
