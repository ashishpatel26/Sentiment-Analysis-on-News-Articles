"The latest Hillary Clinton flap has begun, prompted by a story in Tuesday’s Times revealing that, during Clinton’s four years as Secretary of State, she used a private e-mail account rather than a government-issued one. The story raised the possibility that this practice may have violated federal record-keeping requirements, and also raised possible security concerns, especially if she was using an e-mail account that wasn’t encrypted. Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Michael S. Schmidt, of the Times, “I can recall no instance in my time at the National Archives when a high-ranking official at an executive-branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business.”","March 3, 2015","1","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"

"I happened to be on Twitter last night, when the story broke, and the reaction must have almost crashed the site. After a couple of hours monitoring the responses, which included a tweet from Jeb Bush calling on Clinton to release all of her unclassified e-mails, I went to bed wondering: What the heck was that all about?","3","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"In the light of day, the question can be disassembled into three subsidiary queries: How did Clinton set up the private account? Why did it happen? And what are its implications, if any, for the 2016 campaign?","4","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Senior government officials are typically allotted official e-mail accounts. Evidently, Secretary Clinton chose not to use one. In a statement released overnight, her spokesman said, “Like Secretaries of State before her, she used her own email account when engaging with any Department officials. For government business, she emailed them on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained. … Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government emails, as long as appropriate records were preserved.”","5","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"The Times didn’t reveal which e-mail service Clinton chose, but, citing commercial records, Philip Bump, of the Washington Post, pointed out that, on January 13, 2009, the same day Clinton’s Senate confirmation hearings began, someone registered the domain name clintonemail.com with the technology firm Network Solutions.","6","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Perhaps, this clears up a bit of the mystery—though knowing the domain name and registrar doesn’t say anything about what security measures, if any, Clinton took. Nor does it address the larger issue of whether legal counsel with the State Department signed off on the decision to use a private account. Did the Secret Service and the White House know about it? The Secret Service, in particular, is very concerned about security breaches. Early in President Obama’s term, we subsequently learned, its agents stripped him of his personal BlackBerry and provided him with a more secure version. (As far as I’ve seen, it hasn’t been revealed what sort of e-mail account the President uses.)","7","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Now, to the question of why Clinton would have chosen to use a private account. There is a history here. In 2007, it emerged that some Bush Administration officials had been using non-White House e-mail accounts, the archives of which were subsequently deleted. At the time, Democrats and public-interest groups accused the Bushes of seeking to shield their correspondence from government record keepers, inquisitive Congressional committees, and journalists making Freedom of Information requests. (A story by Vox’s Max Fisher provides more details.)","8","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Until the Clinton camp provides a convincing explanation to the contrary, many observers will assume that Hillary, too, was taking steps to shield her correspondence from prying eyes. Given her family’s history, that wouldn’t be particularly shocking.","9","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"In light of the scandals and enmity that have surrounded them, the Clintons have long taken an assiduous approach to guarding their records and their privacy. On one level, that’s perfectly understandable. By the start of 2008, Clinton had been embroiled in bitter partisan warfare for more than a decade and a half. Upon agreeing to become the Secretary of State, she would have known perfectly well that her political enemies, on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, would be seeking to put her down at every turn—making allegations, holding hearings, and demanding internal documents, including records of her personal communications. It’s also fair to assume that Clinton had at least half an eye on another Presidential campaign, during which those same political foes would scrutinize every record and document available from her time at Foggy Bottom.","10","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Clinton’s concerns, assuming she indeed had them, turned out to be justified. Since the deadly assault in September, 2012, on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, House Republicans and others have spent an inordinate amount of time and effort trying to pin responsibility for the attack on her, demonstrating, along the way, that there are few tactics that they won’t stoop to in order to tar her image. Now, doubtless, they will try to use the e-mail flap to resurrect the Benghazi controversy.","11","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Whether there will be broader political fallout is another matter. As the Times article pointed out, and the Clinton camp’s statement repeated, previous Secretaries of State, Colin Powell among them, have used private e-mail accounts for some (but not all) of their communications. That gives Hillary some cover. Journalists and Republican opposition-research teams will continue to dig, but, unless they can come up with something juicier and more specific, such as a damaging e-mail that was withheld from Congressional investigators, the story may not go much further.","12","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Of course, these revelations become part of a steady drip of negative articles that are doing some damage to Clinton’s nascent Presidential bid, starting with the various revelations about the fund-raising activities of the Clinton Foundation, which my colleague Amy Davidson wrote about last week. There is a widespread feeling, among political professionals and the commentariat, that Clinton, having chosen to delay the launch of her campaign, might be on the point of losing control of its narrative. “We have had our head up our ass,” a former senior Clinton aide told Politico’s Gabriel Debenedetti and Glenn Thrush.","13","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"But it can also be argued that, by publishing these stories now, the media might end up doing Clinton a favor. In the public-relations industry, the standard method of managing potential crises is to get the worst news out early, seek to weather it, and then argue that subsequent revelations are mere wrinkles on a story that has already been told. In 2011 and 2012, Mitt Romney flouted this methodology. Instead of releasing his tax records, which showed that he had paid a very low tax rate, at the start of his campaign, he waited until a few months before the election. That hurt him, a lot.","14","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Thanks to the efforts of the Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post, at least some of the potentially damaging material on Clinton is out there already. By this time next year, will anybody be talking about Hillary’s personal e-mail account or the Clinton Foundation’s donors? We shall see.","15","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-her-e-mails"
"Following his appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” over the weekend, when he declined to offer a full endorsement of Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign bid, Mayor Bill de Blasio found himself on the front of New York City’s tabloids on Monday. “STABBED IN DE BACK,” blared the Daily News. The Post ran with “HILL’S FURY” and the subhead “Blaz won’t endorse as prez run official.”","April 13, 2015","16","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"As a former newspaper headline writer, I could admire the “DE BACK” formulation, but I was also keen to read what de Blasio had actually said. He turned out to have described Clinton as “a tremendous public servant” and “one of the most qualified people ever to run for this office.” But unlike New York’s two Democratic senators, Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as Governor Andrew Cuomo, de Blasio declined the opportunity to issue a full public endorsement of Clinton’s candidacy, saying, ”We need to see the substance.”","17","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"

"Coming from a politician who served in Bill Clinton’s Administration and who helped to run Hillary’s successful campaign for Senate in 2000, these comments were a bit surprising, especially since they were spoken a few hours before Hillary’s official announcement. I am sure they irked some people in the Clinton camp. But before we extrapolate this story into a major breach between Hillary and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, it’s worth looking in a bit more detail at the economic issues that might divide the two sides.","19","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"“I think progressives all over the country, I think everyday Americans are demanding that their candidates—the President and every other level—really say that we have a plan that we can believe in for addressing income inequality,” de Blasio said, in explaining his wait-and-see attitude. “It has to include increases in wages and benefits. It has to include the willingness to tax the wealthy so we can invest in infrastructure, so we can invest in education.”","20","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"This statement was certainly more specific than what Clinton offered in the video she released to announce her candidacy, in which she says, “Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times. But the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion.” But in identifying the very rich as the beneficiaries of unfair circumstances rather than of individual enterprise and hard work, and in prioritizing the material circumstances of the middle class, Clinton was clearly pitching her tent on the same turf occupied by progressives like de Blasio and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.","21","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"The question, of course, is whether Clinton’s words were just talk. De Blasio was well within his rights to take a noncommittal attitude—indeed, his progressive supporters would have demanded no less. Traditionally, the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party has emphasized promoting “opportunity” over reducing inequality. As Lawrence Mishel, the president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, pointed out in a blog post last week, that approach has sometimes enabled centrist Democrats to “avoid confronting the top 1 percent’s capture of the lion’s share of income growth. After all, addressing runaway executive pay and a runaway financial sector—the main causes of the top 1 percent’s income gains—smacks of redistribution; and besides, those folks are their donor base.” With Hillary and her staff about to hit up hedge-fund managers, investment bankers, tech moguls, and other rich folks for hefty campaign contributions, the suspicion lingers that, when it comes down to it, her campaign will punt, rather than directly confront, the entrenched problems of income and wealth inequality.","22","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"On the other hand, the political center of gravity has shifted in the Democratic Party, and there are reasons to hope that Clinton will embrace a more progressive, far-reaching agenda than anything that her husband and his fellow New Democrats would have endorsed in the nineteen-nineties. Since the financial crisis and the Great Recession, which were widely perceived to have been the work of Wall Street, inequality and wage stagnation have come to dominate the policy agenda in a way that they didn’t a decade ago. Even in what used to be called the Rubinite wing of the Party, after former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, there is a widespread recognition that something more is necessary.","23","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"Earlier this year, for instance, the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank created by John Podesta, Hillary’s campaign manager, issued a lengthy report devoted to the subject of “inclusive prosperity.” It was put together by a commission of economists and policy experts led by Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, and Ed Balls, the senior economic spokesman for the British Labour Party. During the nineties, Summers and Balls were both supporters of a “third way” approach to economic policy, which emphasized deregulation and the power of markets. Today their primary concern is coming up with policies designed to raise wages and ameliorate rising inequality.","24","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"Some of the proposals in the C.A.P. report were familiar. The commission called for a rise in the minimum wage and an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit program, which provides cash subsidies to low-wage workers. These are both good ideas, and ones that the Obama Administration has also championed. But what was novel, and potentially costly, in the report was the idea of providing temporary wage subsidies to working households that earn as much as eighty or ninety thousand dollars a year. (The current phase-out threshold for the Earned Income Tax Credit is about twenty-three thousand dollars.) “Short-term middle-class tax relief would ideally be provided until income stagnation is overcome,” the report said. “The tax relief could automatically expire in three years or automatically phase out based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing improvement in wage growth of a specified amount for the middle class.”","25","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"In another part of the report that seemed to go beyond the New Democrat ethos, the C.A.P. commission endorsed various steps to strengthen the bargaining position of workers and labor unions. In addition to endorsing the more expeditious “card check” method of setting up unions, which is a long-time demand of the labor movement, the report called for automatic government arbitration in instances when employers refuse to bargain collectively with newly formed unions, as well as the mandatory establishment of works councils, before which workers’ grievances could be heard. In an effort to insure that workers reap more of the benefits of corporate profits, which have been growing strongly, the report also recommended expanding tax incentives for employee-share-ownership schemes.","26","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"None of these policies represents a big threat to corporate America. But taken together they could help to tilt the balance of power back toward workers a bit and, over time, to give a boost to wages. After all, it’s no accident that wages and incomes have stagnated in the past thirty years. Under the guise of encouraging economic dynamism and responding to international competition, governments on both sides of the Atlantic have spent three decades undermining the gains that workers made during and after the Second World War. To be sure, factors such as globalization and technological progress were partly responsible for the emergence of wage stagnation, but, with a big gap having opened up between productivity and wages, there is no doubt that policy also played a significant role.","27","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"Those at the top of the income distribution have benefitted greatly from the assault on workers’ bargaining power, and from other policies, such as the emasculation of the inheritance tax—one of the few tools available to tackle glaring wealth inequality. Here, too, the C.A.P. report stopped short of endorsing truly radical measures, such as a new tax on wealth, like ones that Thomas Piketty and some other economists have recommended. But the report did call for eliminating a glaring loophole in the tax code, known as the “step-up in basis,” that enables even the very richest families to pass down their fortunes while minimizing their tax liabilities. The report also advocated reforming the mortgage interest deduction and other quirks of the tax code that benefit the wealthy more than anybody else, noting, “Eliminating the tax rules that shelter high-income households and corporations would raise their effective tax rates, make the tax code more progressive, and avoid the waste created by strategies for tax avoidance.”","28","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"To repeat, there is nothing particularly novel or ground-breaking here. Liberals have long advocated levelling the playing field for capital and labor. The Obama Administration has recently called for eliminating the “step-up in basis” and other tax dodges that benefit the ultra-wealthy. What is striking is the convergence in thinking between the center and center-left that has taken place in recent years, as the basic facts about rising inequality have become impossible to ignore. Now it’s up to Clinton and her advisers to exploit this convergence. As long as they are willing to defy some of their more conservative and tax-phobic donors, there is plenty of common ground on which to construct an inequality agenda that will satisfy de Blasio and many other progressives.","29","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"Of course, whatever Clinton does, there will still be some left-leaning Democrats who regard certain of her choices as a sop to the one per cent, or who oppose her on other grounds. That is inevitable. But despite the flap over de Blasio’s remarks, a lasting schism between Clinton and most progressives isn’t inevitable.","30","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-and-the-democrats-inequality-agenda"
"Since the United Nations complex was completed, in 1952, it has hosted all sorts of events, but surely nothing quite like this one. Hillary Clinton, having earlier in the afternoon delivered an uplifting speech to a conference on women’s empowerment, stood before a blue drape emblazoned with the words “Security Council” and “Conseil de Sécurité” and talked about her e-mails.","March 10, 2015","31","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Actually, that wasn’t the only topic she covered. To begin with, she thanked the United Nations for hosting the conference and putting women’s issues at the fore, and reminded everyone of her past work in that arena. “Twenty years ago, this was a lonelier struggle,” she remarked to the scores of reporters arrayed in front of her, recalling when, in 1995, she travelled to Beijing and spoke at the fourth World Conference on Women.","32","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"If the former Secretary of State and First Lady was nervous, she didn’t let it show. She spoke forcefully and unhurriedly. “I want to comment on a matter in the news today,” she said. But, once again, it was a feint. This time, she upbraided the forty-seven Republican signatories to a newly released open letter, addressed to Iranian leaders, that questions President Obama’s authority to reach an agreement to restrict Iran’s nuclear capabilities. The Republicans were either trying to be helpful to the Iranians or harmful to the Commander-in-Chief, Clinton noted. “Either answer does discredit to the letter’s signatories,” she said.","33","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Finally, she addressed the issue that had occasioned the press conference: the revelations that, during her four years as the nation’s top diplomat, she eschewed an official e-mail account and, instead, used a personal account that fed all of her correspondence through a server located at the Clinton family home in Chappaqua, New York.","34","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"","35","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"There were four things that she wanted to tell the American public, Clinton said. First, “I opted for convenience to use my personal e-mail account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails, instead of two,” she said. “Looking back, it would have been better if I’d simply used a second e-mail account and carried a second phone, but at the time this didn’t seem like an issue.”","36","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Was that an explanation, an apology, or both? Could she not have maintained two accounts on one device? Rather than stopping to parse, Clinton offered her second point: that the vast majority of her work e-mails were sent to the official accounts of her colleagues and were, therefore, captured on the State Department’s server. Third, she pointed out that, after she left office and the State Department asked her and other former officials to send them copies of any personal e-mails related to her job, “I responded right away and provided all my e-mails that could possibly be work-related.”","37","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Now we were getting to the heart of the matter. Shortly before Clinton spoke, David Gergen, a former communications adviser to Bill Clinton and other Presidents, suggested, from his perch at CNN, that she should “surprise everyone” by promising to hand over the family server and to submit to an independent review process, in which a respected third party would go through all of the server’s contents and decide if it contained anything else that should be forwarded to the official archives. “I think concrete steps are going to go a lot further,” Gergen said, referring to the expected verbal statements.","38","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"On the face of it, that seemed like sound advice. But it turned out to be advice that Clinton wasn’t in a position to take. “We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related e-mails and deliver them to the State Department,” she said. “At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal e-mails.” Why so? The messages she jettisoned were “about planning Chelsea’s wedding or my mother’s funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends, as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.” She added, “No one wants their personal e-mails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy.”","39","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"It took a few seconds for me to grasp what Clinton was doing: she was attempting to appeal to voters’ sense of fair play, over the heads of her opponents and the media. Not only did she have no intention of handing over more e-mails but the material had been deleted months ago, or so it seemed, without any outside review.","40","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Winding up her prepared remarks with her fourth point, Clinton said that, by handing over all of her work e-mails to the State Department and asking for them to be made public—the latter step she took last week—she had done something unprecedented. And, finally, she repeated that the whole imbroglio had come about in an innocent fashion. “I thought using one device would be simpler,” she said, “and obviously it hasn’t worked out that way.”","41","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Once the question-and-answer session started, the reporters, some of whom had queued up for hours to obtain U.N. credentials, were understandably eager for more details about the deleted e-mails. She said that there had been about sixty thousand e-mails on the personal server in total, and that about half of them were deemed work-related and half of them personal. You didn’t need to be a mathematician, or an investigator for Congressman Darrell Issa (who over the weekend suggested that Clinton could face criminal charges if she failed to coöperate fully with congressional investigators), to appreciate that about thirty thousand e-mails hadn’t been turned over to the State Department.","42","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"“Those e-mails were not in any way related to my work,” Clinton repeated. “I have absolute confidence that the State Department has everything work-related,” she later added. Once she received the request from the department, she said, she had instructed her staff to carry out a thorough investigation, telling it to “err on the side” of disclosing anything that could possibly have been related to her official duties.","43","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"And that was about that. Toward the end, Clinton engaged in some back-and-forth about whether she had obeyed the State Department’s rules, and whether her private e-mail server was vulnerable to security threats. She insisted that she had obeyed the rules, and said that her server was secure. “I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone,” she added.","44","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"In a way, it was a bravura performance. Her body language suggested that she didn’t want to be there, but she stood and answered awkward questions for about fifteen minutes, without losing her cool. The public show of determination looked strong to her supporters, and afterward one of them, the Democratic strategist and pundit Hilary Rosen, said on CNN, “I think she passed a reasonableness test.”","45","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"It remains to be seen whether the public agrees. Practically everyone I have spoken with believes that Clinton set up her private e-mail system not just as a matter of convenience but in order to exert control over what eventually became public. In different circumstances, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and many other politicians appear to have done this, too, including some who were serving in the White House during the Bush Administration.","46","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Clinton’s critics will say that, as Secretary of State, she had a duty to meet a higher standard than those who hold less sensitive and powerful offices. They will also continue to demand that she turn over her e-mail server, just in case there’s anything left on it that should be preserved. Her supporters will point out, as she did, that previous Secretaries of State, including Colin Powell, also used personal e-mail accounts, and they will accuse the critics of being conspiracy theorists. One thing’s for sure: the press conference, extraordinary as it was, didn’t put an end to the story.","47","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-and-her-e-mails-it-was-all-about-convenience"
"Hillary Clinton’s official announcement that she is running for President comes almost ten months to the day that she set out on a book tour to promote “Hard Choices,” a memoir of her four years as Secretary of State. Much has happened since that day, when supporters lined up for hours to get into the Barnes and Noble in Manhattan’s Union Square, where Clinton was signing copies, and some of it will work to her advantage.","April 11, 2015","48","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"With Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to jump into the Democratic primary, Clinton still lacks effective competition, whereas early indications that the Republican contest would turn into a slugfest have been confirmed, with at least half a dozen serious candidates entering, or preparing to enter, the race. In the past year or so, the U.S. economic situation has improved—job growth has picked up (with the exception of last month), and the number of people without health insurance has continued to fall as the effects of the Affordable Care Act have taken hold. Assuming Clinton wins the nomination, both of these things will make it easier for her to defend President Obama’s legacy, and to point to the potential folly, with things improving, of the economy coming under the tutelage of extremist Republicans.","49","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"

"Doubtless, the Republican candidates will subject Clinton to virulent attacks on all manner of subjects, but that could well help her to unite the Democratic Party behind her, and to rally the activists whose support she will need to get out the vote in places such as Florida and Ohio. Moreover, the electoral map remains favorable to the Democrats. If Clinton can carry all of the eighteen states, plus the District of Columbia, that have gone blue in every election since her husband’s first victory, in 1992, she will have two hundred and forty-two electoral votes, leaving her within striking distance of victory. As always, the contest is likely to come down a few battleground states, including Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. If Clinton can hold together the “Obama coalition” of young voters, women, and minorities, she has a very good chance of winning. (On the online-betting sites, she is the firm favorite.)","51","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"While the external circumstances favor Clinton, the preparations for her campaign have been anything but smooth. Her book tour was marred by a series of mini-gaffes—or that’s what the media perceived them to be, anyway. Earlier this year, it emerged that the Clintons’ charitable foundation, which was recently renamed the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, had taken donations from foreign governments, including repressive ones such as the monarchies that rule Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Then came the news that, during her time at the State Department, Clinton set up and operated a private e-mail system, whose server was subsequently wiped clean at her request. Clinton insisted that she had preserved all of the work-related e-mails on her server, about thirty thousand of them, and forwarded copies of them to Congress, but Republicans on Capitol Hill (and on the campaign trail) are unlikely to let the matter drop.","52","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"To be sure, many Democratic strategists insist that the furor over the Clinton Foundation donations and the e-mails are inside-the-Beltway affairs that won’t have any lasting impact on her campaign. But recent opinion polls tell a somewhat different story. In a Gallup poll carried out in early June, 2014, Clinton’s approval rating was fifty-four per cent, and her disapproval rating was forty-three per cent. Now, according to the Huffington Post’s poll-of-polls, her approval rating is forty-eight per cent and her disapproval rating is 46.2 per cent. And two recent polls, from Public Policy Polling and from Fox, show Clinton’s unfavorability rating moving above fifty per cent.","53","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"In the aftermath of the e-mails story, the Republicans also appeared to be eating into Clinton’s putative lead over various G.O.P. candidates in a number of battleground states—gaps that, until recently, had been holding steady. A poll from Quinnipiac University, released a few days ago, showed Clinton tied (statistically speaking) in Colorado and in Iowa with seven Republicans: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, and Ted Cruz. (In Colorado, Walker, Paul, and Rubio were actually leading Clinton, but all of their leads were within the poll’s margin of error.) In Virginia, Clinton still seems to be holding her ground. According to the poll, she leads the Republicans by margins that vary from four points to ten points. But over all, the survey’s message was a worrying one for her campaign: “It is difficult to see Secretary Clinton’s slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail,” the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, Peter A. Brown, said.","54","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Of course, it is very early, and the polling data shouldn’t be taken too seriously. In the old days—I’m talking twenty or thirty years ago—a disapproval rating of more than forty per cent was considered a serious handicap to any candidate, but things have changed. In the current, highly polarized environment, Republicans rarely say they approve of Democrats, or vice versa. At the start of 2012, President Obama’s disapproval rating sat at about fifty per cent, according to Gallup, yet, he handily won reëlection. The key to victory isn’t being popular. It’s being less unpopular than the other candidate and getting your supporters to turn out.","55","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"With a formidable Democratic campaign apparatus to call on and a bruising Republican primary ahead, Clinton shouldn’t have much trouble raising the alarm about the prospect of the G.O.P. controlling the White House, as well as Congress. But, of course, it will be a tough race. The Republicans are coming off a strong performance in the midterms, and the Democrats have occupied the White House for eight years. As Al Gore discovered, in 2000, winning a third Presidential term for your party isn’t easy, even if you win the popular vote.","56","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Clinton’s first task is to switch the focus away from the e-mails story, which has clearly had an adverse effect on her reputation. Until now, her strategy has been to try to tough it out and move on. But she must be aware that the explanation she provided for setting up her own e-mail operation—it was all a matter of convenience—was a flimsy one, and that it didn’t persuade a lot of people. Referring to the Quinnipiac poll in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia, Brown said,“In all three of these states, more, and in Colorado many more, registered voters say she is not honest and trustworthy. Voters do think she is a strong leader—a key metric—but unless she can change the honesty perception, running as a competent but dishonest candidate has serious potential problems.”","57","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Having offered up her version of the e-mails story, Clinton could hardly change tack, but she had to do something to arrest the decline in her numbers. Hence, surely, the decision to launch her campaign now, and then, reportedly, to travel to Iowa in the coming days and, later this month, to New Hampshire. That was clearly the right thing to do. Now Clinton needs to demonstrate that, at the age of sixty-seven, after more than twenty years in the public spotlight, she represents a brighter future rather than a fractious past.","58","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"An important part of her message, and one that the all-male Republican field may well have trouble countering, is that it’s high time for America to elect a female President. But if Clinton is to follow the examples of Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel, and Dilma Rousseff, she will also have to project a powerful message about where she wants to lead the country. In policy terms, all indications are that she will run a traditional Democratic campaign, promoting social mobility and emphasizing the interests of the middle class. That’s what Bill Clinton did in 1992; it’s what she did in 2008; and it’s what Obama did in 2012. Given the enduring problems of wage stagnation and rising inequality, it is the appropriate and right agenda.","59","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"The task is to make it sound fresh and convincing. I well recall Michael Dukakis campaigning on his version of the “middle-class agenda,” and it wasn’t enough to carry him to victory over George H. W. Bush. But things have changed since 1988, when the full scale of the economic challenge facing ordinary Americans was only beginning to be understood. Today there is hardly a policy-oriented economist in the country who isn’t concerned, in some way, about issues relating to wage stagnation and inequality. To tackle these problems and to promote what is often referred to as “inclusive prosperity,” Clinton can call on a wide range of experts, and a number of detailed proposals that Democratic think tanks, such as the centrist Center for American Progress and the liberal Economic Policy Institute have laid out in recent reports. The ideas range from raising the minimum wage and encouraging the growth of trade unions, to changing the tax code and investing in infrastructure.","60","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"
"Policy wonks, myself included, will be watching closely to see what proposals Clinton adopts and which experts she chooses to rely on. (So far, she’s covering all her bases. A few weeks ago, she spoke at a Center for American Progress event. Last week, she attended a meeting organized by the progressive Roosevelt Institute.) But from the broader perspective of her campaign, the imperative is that she taps into the deep economic insecurity that many Americans feel, and that she is seen to have a credible and sensible agenda for tackling it. And on top of that, of course, she will need to craft a foreign-policy message that addresses Americans’ concerns about the chaos they see enveloping many parts of the world, but that hopefully also goes beyond the hawkish stance that she sometimes adopted in the Senate.","61","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-challenge-facing-hillary-clinton"

"Early last week, while the political world was waiting for Hillary Clinton to address the moral, diplomatic, and technological questions posed by her e-mail habits, the United Nations issued a report asserting that more than one in three women experience sexual or physical violence in their lifetimes. One in ten females under the age of twenty is subjected to “forced sexual acts.” In more than thirty countries, it is not illegal for men to beat their wives. In the United States, eighty-three per cent of girls between twelve and sixteen confront sexual harassment in school. Even the earnest bureaucrats of the U.N., who tend to favor euphemism and skip over cruelties like honor killings and “corrective rape,” could not help but label the rate and the variety of mayhem regularly exacted upon half of humankind as “alarmingly high.”","63","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"The report went on to say that female political representation, while creeping higher, is still depressingly low––not least in the world’s oldest constitutional democracy, the United States. The parliaments of South Africa, Ecuador, Finland, Senegal, Sweden, Cuba, Belgium, and Rwanda are all more than forty per cent female. The percentage of members in the U.S. House of Representatives who are women is eighteen. And, since it will soon be political high season on cable TV and at the town halls and diners of Iowa and New Hampshire, it bears repeating that no woman has ever been the President of the United States.","64","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"It was hard not to think of this status report on the condition of women in the twenty-first century while Hillary Clinton stepped into the lights before an agitated crowd of reporters at the U.N. last Tuesday. A large tapestry of “Guernica” hung behind her, and she looked no happier in that setting than the tormented figures in Picasso’s image of civil war. And yet contrition was not in her plans. Instead, she chose a familiar course, offering explanations that were by turns petulant and pretzelled. Asked about the way she chose to deal with federal guidelines on e-mail when she was the Secretary of State, she said, “I opted for convenience.” Clinton’s further explanations were so familiar, such a ride in the Wayback Machine, that you had to wonder, Why do I suddenly feel twenty years younger yet thoroughly exhausted?","65","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"The U.N. Secretary-General’s report is a progress report on the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which grew out of the 1995 World Conference on Women. At that conference, Clinton, as First Lady, gave an unsparing assessment of so many of the grimmer aspects of the female condition: political exclusion, discrimination, rape as a weapon of war, genital cutting, forced illiteracy, forced abortion and sterilization. She performed in a way that suggested both conviction and political talent independent of her role as the President’s wife and counsellor. The speech was as eloquent in its way as Barack Obama’s “race speech,” in the 2008 campaign, not because of its radical originality––like Obama’s, it was rooted in decades of progressive thought––but because of its potential to affect policy and mainstream opinion. “It is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights” was a message she delivered with clarity, particulars, and force.","66","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"This was one reason that the press conference last week—given, presumably, as Clinton was preparing to announce a run for the Presidency, in 2016—was so dispiriting. At that moment at the U.N., she should have been returning to those feminist themes, but she used the opportunity to claim that she was only trying to protect the sanctity of her communications about her “yoga routines,” her daughter’s wedding, and her mother’s funeral. This was a notably transparent exploitation of gender. It’s one thing for a politician to be stupid; it is quite another for her to assume that we are. And what to make of a politician who protested the war in Vietnam and investigated the Watergate scandals but now writes a valentine to Henry Kissinger in the Washington Post—a book review in which Clinton calls Kissinger “surprisingly idealistic”? The peoples of Chile, Cambodia, Argentina, Bangladesh, and East Timor surely want to know more.","67","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"As the Clinton campaign machinery creaks into motion, voters, too, will want to know more. For one thing, who will compete with her? The likeliest Republican candidates do not exactly stride the earth as political colossi. Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, is fast accumulating pots of right-wing money, but that is no guarantee that he can emerge from the ideological margins. Jeb Bush only recently secured his mother’s blessing to run and cannot hope to inspire a frenzy of support with the proposition that he is somewhat brighter than his retired older brother.","68","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"
"It is the job of the press to put pressure on power and on pretenders to power. Even in a solo primary race, reporters will scrutinize not only Hillary Clinton’s record but also her hawkish foreign-policy impulses, the dealings of the Clinton Global Initiative, and the contradiction between the need to ease the inequality gap and the candidate’s tropism toward big money.

However vexed by the politics of gender, America is ready for a woman President. Long past ready. A female President committed to the kind of vision Clinton set out twenty years ago in Beijing could exert a powerful influence on the lives of women all over the world. But if, in the end, Hillary Clinton’s only competition is herself, if all she has to contend with is the press and her less attractive instincts, she will have gained a too easy path to power at the cost of being less prepared to exercise it.","70","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/todays-woman"

"This week, as the Democratic National Committee was preparing to announce that Philadelphia will host the Party’s 2016 convention, Hillary Clinton’s still undeclared Presidential campaign was running into a media squall about money—two of them, actually. First, David Brock, the conservative activist turned liberal activist, resigned from Priorities USA Action, a big money-raising group that is supporting Clinton, and accused the group of taking part in an “orchestrated political hit job” on two other pro-Clinton groups that Brock is involved with. Then, the Guardian revealed that a number of wealthy donors to the Clinton Foundation, a philanthropic organization set up by Bill Clinton, were clients of the Swiss division of H.S.B.C., a big bank that is embroiled in a tax-avoidance scandal.","February 13, 2015","72","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"The upshot of the Brock story was that Hillary’s money guys and gals are squabbling, and that Priorities USA Action, the political-action committee that spent seventy-five million dollars supporting Barack Obama, in 2012, is off to a slow start this year. (According to Politico, it had less than half a million dollars in the bank at the end of 2014.) The Guardian story, which was based on leaked documents from H.S.B.C., identified seven rich donors to the Clinton Foundation who had bank accounts at H.S.B.C.’s Geneva branch. One of them, Richard Caring, a British entrepreneur, “used his tax-free Geneva account to transfer $1m into the New York-based foundation,” the newspaper reported. “The HSBC records suggest Caring’s $1m donation was paid in return for former president Bill Clinton’s attendance at a lavish costume charity ball organised by Caring in St Petersburg, Russia.”","73","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"

"Outside of the political bubble, I doubt that one likely 2016 voter in twenty noticed either of these articles, or the follow-ups. But, at a moment when Hillary is reported to be consulting with numerous experts about how to tackle rising inequality, the articles raise anew an awkward question: How far will the Clinton family’s ties to moneyed interests complicate Hillary’s efforts to fashion a populist campaign built around the theme of defending the middle class?","75","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"One way of seeking to answer that question is to point out that, in politics (and philanthropy, too), cultivating donors and raising a lot of money are unavoidable parts of the business. And, although some people, myself among them, will never be wholly persuaded that he who pays the piper doesn’t call the tune, the average voter doesn’t seem to judge candidates by their financial backers. In 2008, and, to a lesser extent, 2012, Barack Obama’s campaign received a lot of cash from Wall Street. That didn’t prevent him from running as an agent of change, and as someone who was willing to take on vested interests. Hillary, too, has already shown some aptitude in this regard. After falling behind Obama in the campaign of 2007 and 2008, when she seemed to lack a defining theme, she did a pretty good job of reinventing herself as a scrappy fighter for the working stiff, even if, ultimately, it wasn’t enough to save her campaign.","76","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"

"One way to do that is to put together a formidable campaign apparatus and a big war chest. Until the Brock story broke, few people in the political world had believed that these objectives would present a major issue. Evidently, they might. The first task facing John Podesta, the departing White House official who is slated to become chairman of the Clinton campaign, will be to gather together the various Democratic fund-raising groups and persuade them to coöperate. That won’t necessarily be easy. The Brock flap made clear that there are residual tensions between veteran Clintonites, like Brock, and some Obamaites who are preparing to support Hillary. Priorities USA Action was created by two former officials of the Obama Administration, and its co-chairman is Jim Messina, Obama’s 2012 campaign manager. In a Times article that appeared after Brock’s departure, Nicholas Confessore and Amy Chozick noted that “the marriage between the two camps … now appears more uneasy than at any time since Mr. Obama asked Mrs. Clinton to serve in his administration after the 2008 election.”","78","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"The issues relating to the Clinton Foundation, which Bill Clinton founded in 2001, go beyond internecine conflict and bruised egos. Some people close to the Clintons have long been concerned that the foundation’s biggest venture, the Clinton Global Initiative, could present some vulnerabilities for Hillary. In its own words, the C.G.I. “convenes global leaders to create and implement innovative solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges,” For years, it was managed by a handful of longtime aides to Bill Clinton, at least one of whom, Douglas Band, also acted as a highly paid consultant to some of its corporate donors—a fact highlighted in a lengthy 2013 Times article by Confessore and Chozick. The C.G.I.’s high-profile annual conferences, which bring together politicians, chief executives, and celebrities, have always attracted as much attention, or more, than its efforts to tackle problems like hunger, disease, and environmental degradation. Plus, there has been lingering suspicion that some of the organization’s donors were motivated by a desire to gain access to the Clintons.","79","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"In the past couple of years, perhaps partly in an effort to counter some of these concerns, the Clinton Foundation and the C.G.I. have both been overhauled. A new leadership team was appointed to the foundation, Band left the C.G.I., and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton took much more central roles. Today, they are both directors of the Clinton Foundation, and Chelsea is its vice-chair. The Clinton Foundation’s Web site says that she “focuses especially on the Foundation’s health programs, including the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which strengthens health care and access to lifesaving services in the developing world; the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, which fights childhood obesity in the United States; and the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, which addresses preventable disease in the United States.” In 2013, the foundation was officially renamed as the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, and last month a longtime aide to Hillary, Maura Pally, was appointed as its interim chief executive.","80","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"The Guardian story, by highlighting the fact that some of the Clinton Foundation’s donors have been maintaining bank accounts in Switzerland, has focussed attention on its sources of financing rather than its makeover or its philanthropic activities. Among the donors named by the Guardian were the British retail mogul Richard Caring; Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining magnate who appeared earlier this week at C.G.I.’s annual winter meeting, in New York; and Jeffrey Epstein, a New York financier who was jailed in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from underage girls. According to the Clinton Foundation’s donor database, Giustra and charities linked to him have donated at least fifty million dollars. In 2006, Epstein gave twenty-five thousand dollars, the Guardian said. Other donors to the foundation who were identified as clients of H.S.B.C.’s Geneva office included Eli Broad, the Californian entrepreneur and philanthropist, and Denise Rich, whose former husband, the fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich, was pardoned by Bill Clinton just before he left office, in 2001.","81","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"The Guardian was careful to avoid any suggestion of illegality. “It is not unlawful for US or other non-Swiss citizens to hold accounts in Geneva and there is no evidence any of the Clinton donors with Geneva accounts evaded tax,” the story said. The paper cited lawyers for Giustra saying his H.S.B.C. account was for investment purposes and complied with Canadian laws. Caring was “legitimately permitted to keep his assets offshore by a hereditary quirk of UK tax law, under which he is registered as ‘non-domiciled’, courtesy of his Italian-American father,” the story noted. And, in addition, “it is not against US law or charity regulation to accept donations from non-US citizens, or from overseas accounts.”","82","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"Still, to the public at large, Swiss bank accounts are often associated with tax avoidance. In Britain, the allegation that H.S.B.C. helped some of its wealthy clients dodge taxes has become a hot political issue. The Guardian story quoted a speech that Hillary gave at a C.G.I. meeting in 2012, when she said, “One of the issues that I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable manner, especially from the elites in every country…. There are rich people everywhere. And yet they do not contribute to the growth of their own countries. They don’t invest in public schools, in public hospitals, in other kinds of development internally.”","83","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"What should we make of all this? In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, Craig Minassian, said, “We are a philanthropy through and through, and we take pride in our programs, our efficiency, and our transparency…. The Clinton Foundation has strong donor integrity and transparency practices that go well beyond what is required of US charities, including the full disclosure of all of our donors. The contributions of these donors are helping improve the lives of millions of people across the world.”","84","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"The organization has some evidence to back up this claim. Unlike other philanthropies, C.G.I. doesn’t hand out grants or develop its own programs from scratch, such as building schools and hospitals in Africa. Instead, it identifies specific challenges somewhere in the world, solicits commitments from governments and nongovernmental organizations to meet them, finds corporate sponsors willing to finance the projects, and undertakes to help out with expertise, contacts, and encouragement. Last year, it released the results of an internal review of nearly three thousand such commitments made since 2005. The review concluded that they had affected the lives of four hundred and thirty million people in a hundred and eighty countries.","85","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"To be sure, this was an internal study, which relied on data provided by C.G.I.’s partners. An independent appraisal would have carried more weight. But when you read about some of the projects C.G.I. is involved with, as I have been doing, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that its staff of three hundred and fifty people is doing some good in the world—or, at least, trying to do good. Here, selected more or less at random, are a few examples:","86","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"Would some of the many projects with which C.G.I. is involved have gone ahead anyway, without its intervention? Perhaps. But in bringing together charitable organizations and corporations looking to make philanthropic donations, it has carved out a unique role. In the words of Tom Watson, the founder of Cause Wired, a consulting firm that advises not-for-profits, “It’s an investment banking service—old style—for causes and philanthropy.” These days, investment banks aren’t exactly popular, of course. When they were originally formed, however, they played a valuable role in raising capital for entrepreneurs and businesses that needed funding. C.G.I. does the same for not-for-profits.","87","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"In some circles, it should be noted, the tactic of partnering with large companies is controversial because it tends to promote market-based approaches to economic development. Earlier this week, for example, at its winter meeting, the foundation teamed up with Unilever, the multinational home-products company, and Acumen, another New York City-based not-for-profit, to launch a ten-million-dollar program called the Enhanced Livelihoods Investment Initiative, which is aimed at turning small farmers in Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean into suppliers of foodstuffs and raw materials for multinationals. Giustra, the Canadian mining magnate who is also helping to fund the project, said in a statement, “Under this model, entrepreneurs and farmers will gain access to capital and skills training—all essential tools needed to pull them out of poverty.”","88","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"It can be debated whether C.G.I.’s approach is the best one. Some left-leaning critics say that the organization promotes a neoliberal, inequality-accentuating agenda of the type pursued by the Clinton Administration during the nineteen-nineties. Commenting in the Huffington Post about a forum C.G.I. held in Denver last year, Michele Swenson, an author and social activist, said that it “seems nothing if not a meeting of one-percenters.” The Clinton Foundation’s employees and defenders would probably reply that if you can get the one-per-centers to support reducing poverty, eradicating horrible diseases, and empowering poor women, it’s surely a positive development.","89","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"This is a legitimate debate to have—and Hillary, at some point, may well be obliged to engage in it. Indeed, she might be eager to do so. From her perspective, discussing how many lives the Clinton Foundation has improved in sub-Saharan Africa and other deprived regions would be a lot more palatable than getting dragged into the tax affairs of some rich “friends of Bill” or the infighting among her fundraisers.","90","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-money-issues"
"Hillary Clinton is ready for Hillary. That could be gleaned from the video officially launching her run for President in 2016, called “Getting Started,” which was posted on a new YouTube channel Sunday afternoon. It was a strange production: for the first few seconds, it seemed to be an ad that preceded the actual video; it could have been for auto insurance, or soap, or anything. “I’m getting ready for a lot of things—a lot of things,” a young mother says. A daughter starting kindergarten, a new home, springtime. She is followed by a man saying, in Spanish, that he is starting a business; a young black couple expecting a baby; a white woman who is going back to work after staying home with her children for five years; an Asian-American college student looking for a job; a gay couple who are engaged; a biracial couple whose dog just won’t stay out of the kitchen garbage. A white man who has changed careers is seen with and without his Yankees cap. If these people have one thing in common, it is their tendency to suddenly offer up a gesture of symbolic cheer—an abrupt laugh, a thumbs-up, a half-jig, spirit fingers, girl-power bicep flexing, a just-kidding-guys elbow-to-the-ribs. The staginess of Hillary’s own bonhomie was something that many observers thought she might have to overcome. But everyone’s glee in “Getting Started” seems staged, raising the question of whether the video is meant to normalize her or whether that quality is now meant to be a shibboleth, a way to recognize the Hillary people. If someone unexpectedly grins and growls, as the mother and kindergartener do, it means that she is Ready. Or maybe whoever is thinking through Clinton’s campaign’s rhetoric just doesn’t hear how she sounds.","April 12, 2015","91","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-gets-started-2016-campaign"
"“I’m getting ready to do something, too—I’m running for President,” Hillary says, more than a minute and a half into the video, which is two minutes and eighteen seconds long. By that point, a small boy has already explained that he is getting ready to be in a play, in which he will play a fish and wear a fish costume, and has, indeed, begun to sing a fish song. (Perhaps one should be grateful that the candidate does not take up the fishy refrain.) The campaign-announcement video is, granted, a tough genre, and not one that is going to decide anything, particularly in the case of Hillary, who has been campaigning for so long. The “ready” trope is also a call back to “Ready for Hillary,” one of the Super PACs that have already been aggressively raising money and hiring staff. (And the candidate does seem to want to be referred to as “Hillary”; the Web site is “Paid for by Hillary for America,” and its logo is a big blue H inset with a red arrow.) The substance of that campaign is not something one learns much about from the video. After the opening, there are references to decks being stacked and people deserving to get ahead, and what seems intended as the statement of purpose: “Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion!” With what programs, and what tools, and against whom? In some ways there was more substance in this week’s “Saturday Night Live” skit on the making of the video, in which Hillary, played by Kate McKinnon, struggles to record herself on her phone, than in the actual finished product.","92","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-gets-started-2016-campaign"

On her campaign Web site, her biography says that, as Secretary of State, “She built a coalition for tough new sanctions against Iran that brought them to the negotiating table,” but not whether she would fight for the fruits of those negotiations—the draft deal that President Obama has come up with. The choice of an endorser for her foreign-policy work is an unhelpful one, for anyone trying to figure out what she believes: “Even former Republican Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said she ‘ran the State Department in the most effective way that I’ve ever seen.’”","93","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-gets-started-2016-campaign"
"Clinton also, on Friday, published, on Huffington Post, a new epilogue to “Hard Choices,” her memoir of her tenure at the State Department. It begins like this, mentioning President Obama:","94","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-gets-started-2016-campaign"
"When he sees her, he thanks her—for what, it’s not clear—and she goes on to ruminate about “how far we had come” from their first sit-down after he’d defeated her in the 2008 primaries. That’s about all we get on Obama in the rest of the epilogue, other than him also thanking Bill for campaigning for him in 2012: he is grateful to him; he appreciates her. There are outlines of two separate caricatures in there, and Hillary will have to be careful about which one she chooses to play up during her campaign. One is of an Obama who was able to do what he did with the help of her quiet, wise advice. This option would involve her assuming ownership of his foreign-policy decisions. The other is of a lost President, in over his head, who looks around and asks, “Where is she?” (There were hints of this rendition in an interview that Clinton gave to Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic last year.) When the question comes to Obama, and it will, will Hillary be asking voters to remedy a mistake she believes they made in 2008, by not choosing her, or to build on a joint legacy that she is proud of?","95","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-gets-started-2016-campaign"
"A report in the Times this weekend suggested that the Clinton campaign hasn’t quite decided how she’ll talk about Obama. In practical terms, the story said, citing people “briefed on the plans,” the campaign expects him to raise money and that “he would be asked to campaign for her in, among other places, the most heavily African-American counties of the swing states that he won in 2008 and 2012.” But “Mr. Obama would most likely be scarce on the stump in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania, where Mrs. Clinton defeated him in the 2008 primaries by appealing to women and white working-class voters.” Not incidentally, Obama won both of those states in 2012. Hillary has been involved in so many Presidential campaigns, over three decades, that she may be at risk of confusing one with another. It is also not the case that, in modern campaigns, you can confine a candidate’s voice to narrow audiences. And it’s not at all clear that Hillary should. According to the Times, the view in the Clinton camp is that Obama has no choice but to do whatever he can to help get her elected, as his own legacy will be at stake. But they should recognize that there might be a point where Obama stops seeing it that way, or becomes ambivalent in a way that is visible to voters. (So far, he has said that he’s sure she would be “excellent,” but he’s also pointed out that he won’t be on the ballot.) Perhaps Hillary would rather have it that way. But any campaign that says it’s about women and doesn’t make full use of, or even alienates, Michelle Obama may not really be ready to win.","96","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-gets-started-2016-campaign"
"It is clear, at any rate, that one person the Hillary campaign loves to mention is Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, Chelsea’s new daughter. The grandmother theme is hit on repeatedly in the epilogue to “Hard Choices,” and will be again, and again. (“I was delighted to find that Charlotte’s birth seemed to strike a chord with a lot of Americans.”) Who is Hillary? She has a team, a smile, a grandchild, and a campaign office in Brooklyn, and she is ready.","97","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-gets-started-2016-campaign"
"Nearly sixty years ago, there was trouble in Poland and more so in Hungary, both Soviet satellite states. When the Russians sent troops to Hungary, the United States was pressed to do something, or at least say something. The pressure, and the stakes, grew when what had started as street protests became a full-fledged uprising and the Soviet Union used tanks to crush it with deadly force.","March 19, 2015","98","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"Attention turned to President Dwight Eisenhower, and to his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, who was known for his stern views on Communist ideology and used the provocative word “liberation” in connection with Eastern Europe. What Dulles and others said publicly, though, was not exactly what they said behind their office doors. There, the emphasis was less on confrontation and more on how to phrase another numbingly repetitive diplomatic note. In late October, 1956, Dulles telephoned Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., the American ambassador to the United Nations, and said that he was disturbed by “clear evidence of considerable Soviet military activity in the area,” but suggested only that the question be brought before the U.N. Security Council. Dulles seemed equally concerned about how America’s passive response would look to others. “From a political standpoint,” he remarked, “it will be said that here are the great moments and when they came and these fellows were ready to stand up and die, we were caught napping and doing nothing.” The next day, when Vice-President Richard Nixon’s office called for advice on what to say, Dulles was particularly cautious: Nixon could certainly “refer to love of country and individual freedom surviving and bursting forth and today the whole area of Soviet satellites is a seething mass and one can look forward hopefully to when national independence and liberties will be restored,” he said, according to notes taken by his secretary. At the same time, “We don’t want to upset anything.”","99","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"

"We know about these earnest and somewhat embarrassing exchanges because our government has excellent records. Memoranda provide descriptions of meetings and telephone calls; correspondence—whether by mail or cable—was preserved; minutes were kept of sessions of the National Security Council and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, much of them eventually published. All this helped to lessen the chance for misunderstandings among departments in Washington and between the United States and foreign governments. Thanks to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the State Department’s Office of the Historian, and others, these contemporaneous impressions of what was said and thought while policies were formed produce a historical inheritance of great value.","101","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"E-mail didn’t exist then, but if it had, it’s easy to imagine that some of this material might have been lost—not because it compromised national security but because it provided retroactive evidence of poor judgment or naïveté. Someone might have been embarrassed, and hit delete. Before meeting with Eisenhower in 1954, for instance, Dulles prepared a memo on Indochina, which, with unintentional comic understatement, observed that “any use of atomic weapons will raise very serious problems” with public opinion in Asia, and might affect the “attitude of our allies.” Dulles also saw what was happening in Hungary as “the beginning of the collapse of the Soviet Empire.” No one, though, removed any of this from the files.","102","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"All this is a way of getting to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who conducted official business (though not, she says, classified business) on a private e-mail account with a personal server, using a personal, almost clubby address (hdr22@clintonemail.com). She decided to delete more than thirty thousand e-mails—about as many as she saved—because she judged them to be irrelevant to her work or “my private, personal e-mails,” as she put it at a press conference last week. “For any government employee, it is that government employee’s responsibility to determine what’s personal and what’s work related,” Clinton said. “I went above and beyond what I was requested to do.” That interpretation led one NARA employee to tell me, with something of an archivist’s passion, “Anytime a government official takes it upon themselves to edit their own communications, good government ceases to exist.”","103","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"Keeping track of electronic records has been confusing, and a little overwhelming. Alexander Stille, in his 2002 book “The Future of the Past,” noted that it took the National Archives two and a half years and its entire electronic-records staff “just to make a secure copy of all the electronic records of the Reagan White House.” Adam Mazmanian, a young tech journalist, recently cited a report by the Office of Inspector General that State Department employees in 2011 created about sixty-one thousand so-called “record e-mails,” properly preserved for history, out of about a billion—that’s not a typo—sent. The law has had to hurry to keep up. It may have been perfectly legal to do what Clinton did. But Clinton seemed too untroubled by her role as judge and jury of what’s personal, without acknowledging that the personal is sometimes inseparable from the historic. On a small scale, Eisenhower’s advice to his grandson, David—for instance, a suggestion that he not gobble his food—reveals something interesting about Ike, who had stomach problems for most of his life. That advice can be found in the Eisenhower Library, in Abilene, Kansas. The remarkable diaries kept by Ike’s personal secretary, Ann C. Whitman, include a painful, very personal conversation in which the President told the Republican National Committee chairman to tell Nixon that he was being dumped from the ticket in 1956—but to tell him “very, very gently.”","104","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"But if the law had not been perfectly clear while Clinton was in office, the State Department nonetheless urged officials using personal accounts to be sure that that “federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.” That appropriate system is NARA, the archives where our nation’s official past—with all its peculiarities, embarrassments, compelling personalities, and surprises—is kept and studied. If something as transitory as an e-mail is gone, it’s gone for good, and with it a piece of our shared history.","105","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"
"Those who don’t like Clinton have used all this as a way to bludgeon her on familiar grounds—her reflexive secrecy, her answers that leave us with more questions. In the overwrought language of Presidential politics, some have tried to evoke the Watergate era by suggesting the cover-up of some unspecified deed and even raising the possibility of obstruction of justice. But that’s not very likely; rather, it is in the obstruction of history, the deletion of America’s past, intentional or not, where permanent damage is likely to occur.","106","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillary-clinton-and-the-historians"

"If you’re old enough to remember the beginning of the first Clinton Presidency, in 1993, you may remember a joke that circulated at the time. It went something like this: Bill and Hillary Clinton are driving near her home town. They stop to get some gas, whereupon Hillary recognizes the station attendant as a high-school boyfriend. After they drive off, Bill tells her, smugly, “See, if you’d married him, you’d be working at a gas station.” Hillary smartly replies, “If I’d married him, he’d be President.”","April 14, 2015","182","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"","183","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"The humor of the joke lay in its recognition of the distinctive characteristics of Hillary Rodham Clinton, as she was still known back then: she was a political spouse who didn’t pretend to be apolitical, a professional woman who hadn’t shelved her own career to support her husband’s, an unapologetic possessor of a steely intellect who didn’t restrict herself to traditionally female spheres. While campaigning for the Presidency, Bill Clinton actively touted Hillary as a potential asset in government, telling supporters that his slogan might as well be “Buy one, get one free.” That Hillary was her husband’s equal in ability and acuity—if not, at the time, in political charisma—was a given. What was new was the open acknowledgement that a man as driven, intelligent, and ambitious as Bill Clinton might want a wife who was his equal in all those dimensions, rather than one who was a helpful, pliable, even decorative subordinate.","184","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"But the comedy of the gas-station joke also depended upon a deeper cultural assumption: that the closest Hillary was going to get to the Presidency was being married to a man who was President, not by inhabiting the role herself. If, during the 1992 campaign, some pundits were sufficiently impressed by Hillary’s mastery of policy to express the opinion that she should have been on the ballot instead of Bill, their saying so was a means of articulating admiration for Hillary, rather than describing a realistic scenario. Her Presidency was less plausible, even in humor, than the political ascendance of a gas-station attendant. Back in the early nineties, it felt like a tremendous advance in sexual politics that the nation had, at last, acquired a First Lady who—campaign-trail cookie-recipe posturing aside—didn’t have to pretend to be less formidable than she was. But Hillary Clinton’s Presidential candidacy, still less her Presidency, was imaginable only in an alternate universe.","185","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"It turns out that to arrive at that alternate universe, we simply had to wait: with her announcement this weekend, Hillary becomes the Democratic candidate presumptive, and the strongest contender in the entire Presidential field. All policies and positions aside, her anticipated nomination is the belated righting of a historical wrong: a feminist landmark within reach, almost a century after women achieved the vote in the United States, with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, in 1920, one year after the birth of Dorothy Howell Rodham, Hillary’s mother. Two women have represented the major parties on Presidential ballots before now, but only in the role of Vice-Presidential nominee: Geraldine Ferraro, in 1984, seconding Walter Mondale, and Sarah Palin, in 2008, alternately supporting and undermining John McCain. The Vice-Presidency is frequently a route to the Presidency itself; Hillary’s nomination would present the first opportunity for a woman to be installed in the top job without having to use that side door.","186","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"But Hillary has been in and out of the White House before, conducted by her husband. This means, inevitably, that her triumph would be a more ambivalent victory than that promised by the abstract idea—or ideal—of the first female President. What does it say to women that their first path to the Presidency is through marriage? What might it someday say to their daughters? For better or worse, President Obama, when running for office and when newly elected, offered a tabula rasa for the projection of hopes and aspirations; some of those dreams have turned out not to have been entirely unfounded. (Millions more Americans now have health insurance, for one thing.) Hillary Clinton, by contrast, reminds us that we’re still a long way away from gender equality. Her candidacy embodies the compromises and the qualifications that so frequently make a woman’s route to success more circuitous and perilous than those of her male peers.","187","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"
"“Compromise” or “Settle” makes for a less grabby one-word lapel button than does “Hope,” but such words capture an important aspect of Hillary’s political and domestic persona—one that, in the end, may be no less persuasive and inspiring to those female voters for whom Hillary’s ascent is cause for celebration. In a way, the path that Hillary has taken to arrive where she is—within striking distance of having the job which, two dozen years ago, seemed so beyond her—is a confirmation, not a repudiation, of what most women already know: that a goal is more likely to be arrived at incrementally than it is to be accomplished sweepingly. Once we have elected the first female President whose husband is a former male President, we can elect the first female President whose husband has never held elective office. Eventually, perhaps, we will elect the first female President who is married to a woman, or who isn’t married to anyone—although, admittedly, the alternate universe in which that last might happen still seems many years away. Meanwhile, did you hear the one about the time Bill and Hillary met a cocktail waitress in a bar just outside Hope, Arkansas?","188","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hillary-for-president-no-joke"

"In the corporate-food world these days, everyone wants to achieve “the Chipotle effect,” the profit that accrues to a brand that manages to be neither McDonalds nor Applebee’s—not junk food, exactly, and not a punch line. The same appears to be true of Presidential candidates. Less than twenty-four hours after Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy on Twitter—“Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion”—she was in line at a Chipotle outside of Toledo (chicken burrito bowl, yes on guac). Her staff is spending a lot of time emphasizing that the campaign is not simply about Clinton, so it let the Chipotle story filter out by telling donors and advisors, knowing full well where that would lead. By nightfall, the Times was in possession of security-camera footage of the former First Lady paying for her burrito, unrecognized in her shades, and performing the ritual carrying of her tray. Chipotle started trending on Twitter.","April 15, 2015","205","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"

"Clinton’s campaign has made a point of touting its digital savvy and preparations. Her chief technology officer, Stephanie Hannon, was Google’s director of product management for civic innovation and social impact. Her digital director, Katie Dowd, is a longtime Clinton aide, at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. Clinton is also being advised by Teddy Goff, who oversaw President Obama’s social media, online advertising and fundraising, and digital product development in 2012. This is a significant improvement over Clinton’s campaign in 2008, which wasn’t very good at the computer, fuelling a strain of humor akin to that of the reporter Jonathan Darman, who imagined how the candidate might have responded to news of a Tumblr spoof: “How do we get them to take down the Tumblr and/or how do we destroy Facebook?”","207","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"
"Clinton’s campaign is said to be planning a tech operation three times the size of Obama’s in 2012, but infrastructure is a minimal prerequisite. Digital strategy is long past the point of optimizing clever campaign tweets or testing fund-raising e-mails to induce people to click. (In 2012, the Obama campaign found that more people clicked on messages with the subject line “Hey” than any other.) Today, the challenge is to figure out smart ways to make the campaign “travel,” digitally, that is, bounce around the Web. Unfortunately for Clinton, gravitas is not viral gold, which is part of the reason her campaign released a launch video so relaxed and comforting that it was the television-ad equivalent of pajamas with feet. (My colleague Andy Borowitz imagines a follow-up “featuring nothing but kittens.”) The ad featured a diverse mix of non-actors talking about their dreams—Latino brothers excited about starting a business, two men looking forward to their wedding—but it was most notable for its lack of self-seriousness. A guy with a dog in a kitchen described his dream: “We really just want to teach our dog to quit eating the trash.”","208","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"
"It’s a cliché these days to say that the question hovering over Clinton’s campaign is about its “rationale”: Why is she running? The truth, though not very high-minded, is that Clinton’s success over the next several months (not to mention the next nineteen) will hinge less on her plans for Yemen than on her ability to persuade people not to roll their eyes at the mention of another President Clinton. It’s no coincidence, then, that Clinton is being advised by Roy Spence, the ad guru who persuaded DoubleTree Hotels to make its central marketing icon the warm chocolate-chip cookies that guests receive upon arrival. For Southwest Airlines, his firm came up with “You are now free to move about the country.” “If I owned Roy’s Security Systems, I would have an outdoor board that said, ‘Peace of mind for $48 a month,’ instead of promoting just security systems or monitoring services,” Spence says. He creates a vibe, and Clinton needs one.","209","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"
"Clinton’s image has also received the attentions of Wendy Clark, the president for sparkling (not a typo) brands and strategic marketing for North America at Coca-Cola, according to the Washington Post. In January, Clark, an expert on youth-oriented social media, said that she was taking a few months away from Coke. Clinton needs the youth: one of big reasons she lost in 2008 was that voters under thirty leaned heavily toward Obama. Coke has one of the most “liked” pages on Facebook, thanks to its fast and casual approach to messages and campaigns. In a Spencian moment, Clark describes Coca-Cola’s “purpose” as delivering “happiness.” Her first of eight principles for digital success: “Be shareworthy in everything you do.”","210","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-shareworthy"

At a press conference in Baltimore on Tuesday, Martin O’Malley, the former Democratic governor of Maryland, said that he won’t seek the U.S. Senate seat that Barbara Mikulski, Maryland’s five-term Democratic senator, has announced she will vacate in 2016. Rather than entering a Senate race in which he would immediately be the favorite, O’Malley appears set to go all-in and challenge Clinton for the Democratic Presidential nomination.","March 4, 2015","231","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"Officially, O’Malley is still merely considering a bid. But his travel schedule suggests otherwise. Last weekend, he was in South Carolina; this weekend he’s headed to New Hampshire. He has also scheduled trips to Iowa this month and next.","232","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"If O’Malley does formally enter the race, he’ll be a heavy underdog, of course. Still, he’ll find some encouragement from Clinton’s ongoing troubles. On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that she maintained her own home-brew server for the private e-mail address that she has been revealed to have used for work correspondence as Secretary of State, rather than relying on an outside service, such as Google or Yahoo. “Operating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails,” the A.P. story said.","233","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"Yesterday, I expressed some skepticism about whether the e-mail flap would amount to much over the long term, and about whether the Republicans would be able to use it against Clinton once the campaign proper starts. In seeking to keep her State Department e-mails from prying eyes, she clearly skirted the rules. But it appears that she didn’t break the federal recordkeeping laws in place at the time, and everyone knows that she has good reason to be paranoid: on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, many people are out to get her, Republican attack dogs prominent among them.","234","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"The danger to Clinton is cumulative and close to home. In the past few weeks, many Democrats, particularly those on the progressive wing of the party, have been reminded of their reservations about a Clinton restoration. To begin with, there was the spectacle of Hillary, fresh from the State Department, traipsing around the country making highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, the Carlyle Group and other redoubts of the one per cent. Last week came the revelation that foreign governments were making financial contributions to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was still serving as Secretary of State. And now there’s her e-mail system, which appears to have been explicitly designed to frustrate legitimate requests for documents from the media and from Congress. It all adds to the impression that the Clintons operate by their own set of rules.","235","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"So far, other potential Democratic challengers, who include Vice President Joe Biden and Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, have shied away from criticizing Hillary directly, but this may be about to change. During O’Malley’s recent trip to South Carolina, the Associated Press reported, he “took a veiled shot at Clinton, warning Democrats that more ‘triangulation’ would not be a successful strategy for the party.”","236","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"The reference, to Dick Morris’s term describing Bill Clinton’s strategy for transcending ideological polarities, hardly constituted a venomous attack. O’Malley, who began his career in politics by working for Gary Hart’s 1984 Presidential campaign, is a thoughtful and deliberate politician, rather than a showman or a brawler. His standing in Democratic politics is currently diminished, however, by the results of last November’s gubernatorial election, in which O’Malley’s chosen successor, his lieutenant governor, Anthony Brown, suffered an upset defeat to the Republican candidate, Larry Hogan.","237","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"O’Malley had a strong record as governor, promoting the use of information technology, seeing liberal measures on immigration and gay marriage into law, and repealing the death penalty for future offenders. In recent months, he has been reaching out to progressives in the early primary states, and echoing many of the themes that made Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren popular, such as calling for the break-up of big banks. ”People want to see new faces,” Dan Calegari, a Democratic activist in New Hampshire, told the A.P. “There’s a certain amount of Clinton fatigue. They’ve been around for thirty years now. Quite honestly, I think if Martin decides to get in the race, he will surprise some people.”","238","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"To repeat, O’Malley would be a long shot. British bookmakers currently have the odds that he will win the nomination set at around twenty-five-to-one. Warren, despite her protestations that she won’t run, is at seven-to-one. Biden is at sixteen-to-one. Clinton remains the favorite, of course, but the betting markets suggest that the race isn’t entirely sewn up. At most of the bookmakers, the odds on her emerging as the Democratic candidate are one-to-three, which means that you would have to put down three dollars to win one dollar. These numbers imply that there’s a seventy-five-per-cent probability that Clinton will get the nomination. Until now, most political operatives and pundits, myself included, have been tacitly assuming that the chances that Hillary won’t be the Democratic candidate were lower than one in four. It may be time for a reassessment.","239","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-democratic-challenger"
"On Monday night, Sean Hannity opened his show on Fox News by claiming that new developments had emerged that could derail Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign. He was referring to the revelation, in the Times, that an upcoming book, “Clinton Cash,” by Peter Schweizer, a conservative speechwriter and author, reportedly alleges that overseas donors to the Clinton Foundation, as well as foreign entities that paid Bill Clinton for speeches, received favors from the State Department while Hillary was in charge.","April 22, 2015","240","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"

"Paul replied, “I’ve been briefed by Peter Schweizer on this book, and the facts are going to be alarming, they are going to be mind-boggling, and I think people are going to read this book and they’re going to say, ‘My goodness … how can this happen in America?’ ”","242","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"","243","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"On one level, Paul’s prediction may prove correct. Many viewers of Hannity and other Fox programs will probably seize on the new book in order to confirm their view that Hillary Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency. But none of these people were going to vote for her anyway. Politically, the important question is what impact, if any, the book’s allegations will have on independent voters, who may or may not vote for Clinton, and also on liberal Democrats who are inclined to vote for her, and maybe even to campaign for her, but who still have some reservations.","244","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"On this front, my guess is that “Clinton Cash” (whose full title is “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich”) could end up benefitting Hillary. With Hannity and other conservative media figures piling on, the Clinton campaign will be able to portray questions about the Clinton Foundation and the family’s finances as a political witch-hunt rather than a legitimate exercise in vetting Presidential candidates. And if that happens, many Americans may end up dismissing the whole thing as a partisan squabble.","245","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Obviously, this is speculation. Not having read the book, which comes out on May 5th, I am relying on accounts from journalists who have. But if their versions of what the book contains are accurate, then Schweizer doesn’t back up his suggestions of wrongdoing with much in the way concrete evidence, which would allow the Clintons’ defenders to go on the offensive. Indeed, this is already happening. On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Tuesday, David Brock, the founder of Media Matters, the liberal-leaning media watchdog, who recently appears to have morphed into a Clinton campaign spokesman, said, “I think this is a political put-up job, and I can smell it from a mile away.”","246","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Schweizer is a former fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of several conservative policy tomes as well as books about the Bush family and the Reagan Administration. According to the biography on his Web site, he served as a speechwriting consultant to the Bush Administration from 2008 to 2009. He is now the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative research organization based in Florida that, during the 2012 campaign, issued a report accusing the Obama Administration of illegally soliciting foreign donations. On the other side of the ledger, he has written two books about money and politics that criticized politicians from both parties, including Dennis Hastert, the former Republican Speaker of the House. One of them, published in 2011, was titled “Throw Them All Out.”","247","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"But most of Schweizer’s writing appears to have been directed at Democrats, and he is clearly a man of the right. In 2011, the Times reported that he was advising Sarah Palin on foreign policy. Brock, during his appearance on MSNBC, claimed that the Government Accountability Institute has received funding from entities affiliated with the Koch brothers, adding, “It’s subsidized by Hillary Clinton’s enemies.” On Tuesday night, according to Politico’s Gabriel Debenedetti, Brian Fallon, Clinton’s press secretary, circulated a memo to the campaign’s surrogates and allies, echoing Brock’s charges. “The book was backed by a Koch Brothers–linked organization and a billionaire family that is bankrolling Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign,” Fallon wrote.","248","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"It will be one thing if Schweizer has the goods on the Clintons—i.e., detailed evidence supporting his claim that policy decisions were influenced by financial donations and speaking fees. But, despite Rand Paul’s claims, it doesn’t sound as though the book will supply that level of detail. Reportedly, Schweizer relies heavily on timelines, linking the dates of donations to the Clinton Foundation and speaking fees paid to Bill Clinton with actions by the State Department while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. The Times’s Amy Chozick, for example, writes that Schweizer cites a free-trade agreement with Colombia that benefitted a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, and payments to Bill Clinton by a Canadian bank and a big shareholder in the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the State Department was studying at the time.","249","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"The timelines are suggestive, but are they anything more than that? Many interested parties and institutions were weighing in on issues like trade deals and the Keystone pipeline, and former Obama Administration officials have already dismissed any suggestion that the Colombia agreement was altered to reward a Clinton Foundation donor. In a blog post published on Tuesday, another person who got hold of Schweizer’s book, Aviva Shen, a senior editor at Think Progress—which is published by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank with ties to the Clintons—writes, “Schweizer makes clear that he does not intend to present a smoking gun, despite the media speculation. . . . Schweizer explains he cannot prove the allegations, leaving that up to investigative journalists and possibly law enforcement.” Shen also quotes Schweizer on the Clintons: “We cannot ultimately know what goes on in their minds and ultimately provide the links between the money they took and the benefits that subsequently accrued to themselves, their friends, and their associates.”","250","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"Of course, given the wealth that the Clintons have accumulated since Bill Clinton left office, it is perfectly legitimate, and, indeed, imperative, for journalists to examine their finances and try to identify possible conflicts of interest. News outlets such as the Post, the Times, and the Wall Street Journal have been delving into these issues for months, generating lots of stories and quite a bit of critical commentary. (Back in February, I published a long post on Hillary Clinton’s money issues.

"In this context, it is neither surprising nor scandalous that several news organizations, including the Times and the Post, have reportedly made deals with HarperCollins, Schweizer’s publisher, to view the book in advance of its publication date. “We are always willing to look at new information that could inform our coverage,” Cameron Barr, the Post’s national editor, said in a statement reported by Politico’s Dylan Byers. “Mr. Schweizer’s background and his point of view are relevant factors, but not disqualifying ones. What interests us more are his facts and whether they can be the basis for further reporting by our own staff that would be compelling to our readers. There is no financial aspect to this arrangement.”","252","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"

"From here on out, however, things could get tricky for journalists covering the Clinton donations. Every word they write will be doubly scrutinized for evidence of political bias, and Hillary Clinton’s campaign operatives will be on hand to dismiss as part of a G.O.P.-inspired vendetta anything that is critical of the candidate. Until this week, it was easy to label such tactics as political spin, and few fair-minded people questioned the credibility of the Clinton money stories or the motivations of those writing and publishing them. Now that Schweizer has entered the fray, with the likes of Hannity and Paul to ballyhoo what appear to be largely unsubstantiated allegations, partisan politics is likely to color the views of the broader public. If and when Hillary Clinton falls back on the old argument that it’s all a right-wing conspiracy against her and her family, many people might well be prepared to take her at her word.","254","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/clinton-cash-attacks-could-end-up-aiding-hillary"
"For months now, Elizabeth Warren, the liberal senator from Massachusetts, has been saying she isn’t running for President, but that hasn’t stopped people from speculating about whether she might enter the race at some point. “Now, you didn’t think you’d get away with this interview without me asking you point blank,” Savannah Guthrie, of the “Today” show, said to her on Tuesday. “Are you going to run for President?” Warren replied, “No. I’m not running. And I’m not going to run. I’m in Washington, and I’ve got this great job and a chance to try and make a difference on things that really matter.” That sounded pretty definitive. But just to make sure, Guthrie asked a follow-up: “Are you unequivocally and categorically saying, ‘I’m not running for President in 2016’?” To which Warren replied, “I’m not running. I’m not running.”","April 1, 2015","255","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"

"In the past few weeks, a grassroots campaign to persuade Warren to enter the Democratic primaries had attracted the support of some prominent individuals and institutions. Robert Reich, who served as Labor Secretary in Bill Clinton’s Administration, posted a statement on his Facebook page saying that a tough primary challenge to Clinton would be good for her and for Democrats, adding, “I wish that challenger would be Elizabeth Warren.” The editorial board of the Boston Globe, Warren’s home-town paper, published a lengthy commentary headlined, “Democrats need Elizabeth Warren’s voice in 2016 presidential race.” And two highly regarded progressive activists, Larry Cohen, the president of the Communications Workers of America, and Annie Leonard, the executive director of Greenpeace USA, echoed Reich’s message, coupling it with a statement questioning Clinton’s liberal credentials. “If we end up with a single Democratic candidate—and little to no debate in the primaries,” Cohen and Leonard wrote in an open letter published on the Run Warren Run Web site, “those of us unlikely to support a Republican nominee will be left voting for a Democrat who may be opposed to the Republican agenda but is not necessarily a champion of the vision of change that millions of us seek and that this country needs.”","258","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"With Clinton embroiled in a messy dispute over her decision to delete thousands of e-mails that she sent and received as Secretary of State, and also, apparently, to wipe her private server clean, the effort to draft Warren appeared to be gaining a bit of momentum.

"On Wednesday, MoveOn.org, the liberal advocacy group that helped to get the draft-Warren campaign started, was still featuring on its home page a petition calling on the Massachusetts senator to run. And the organization was continuing to plan a conference, to be held in New York next month, that will feature a number of prominent progressives who are calling on Warren to enter the race. In an e-mail to me, Brian Stewart, MoveOn’s media-relations director, played down the “Today” show interview, writing, “Sen. Warren has repeatedly made clear that she doesn’t plan to run—that’s why we’re running a draft campaign. We are calling on her to run because we believe our country will be better off if she does.”","260","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"

In a blog post explaining why he’s participating in the conference, Lessig said that the one thing that could persuade Warren to change her mind about running was “the recognition that her jumping in is necessary to make a difference. The more of us who speak up, the more clear it will be that this is just such a moment. That there’s a difference that only she can make, at a moment in our history when we desperately need that difference.”","261","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"The draft-Warren movement isn’t going away, then. But, with Clinton preparing to make her candidacy an official one, the political context in which the movement is operating is about to change. Warren’s supporters, having failed to lure her into the fray early, will be left to press her to join the race later on, which would surely happen only if Clinton were to stumble badly.","262","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"That prospect won’t please a lot of progressive activists. Warren, however, seems content with it. The “Today” show’s Guthrie, an admirably persistent interviewer, pressed Warren on whether she believed Clinton “could give a credible voice” to the issues she had raised, such as fighting for the middle class. “Well,” Warren said. “I think we need to give her a chance to decide if she’s going to run and to declare—” Guthrie interrupted her and said, “We know she’s going to run.” Warren paused for a moment, then ignored the interruption and continued, “And to lay out what she wants to run on. I think that’s her opportunity to do that.”","263","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"Coming from someone who had just reiterated that she was engaged with her own agenda, which includes reforming the student-loan program, raising the minimum wage, and protecting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped to create, from Republican attacks, Warren’s words could be interpreted as a statement of encouragement to a party leader whom she respects and wants to be victorious. On the other hand, they fell far short of an endorsement. And for those willing to attribute Machiavellian motives to Warren, they could even be taken as an indication that she had cannily decided to wait and see if Clinton self-destructs.","264","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-liberal-challenge-to-hillary-clinton-what-now"
"In the world of wishing and waiting for Elizabeth, that may well be the preferred interpretation. Even if it’s the correct one, though, it means that Clinton will get to make her case to the Democratic Party, its most progressive supporters included, with only Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, Jim Webb, the former Virginia Senator, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders as potential rivals who have expressed a serious interest in running. While each of these men has policy expertise and a track record, they are still struggling to be taken seriously as Presidential candidates.

"In the original, British “House of Cards,” there’s a plot line that never made it into the American version, for good reason: President Frank Underwood could not, as Prime Minister Francis Urquhart does, design a scheme to force the new king to abdicate. The unnamed monarch—we know he’s meant to be Prince Charles—has just made what amounts to a campaign ad for Labour (Urquhart is a Tory), and so he must go. It’s a brilliant device for an anti-hero, because even though the King wants to help the poor and the marginalized, and even though we have seen the Prime Minister throw a young woman reporter from the roof of Westminster to her death, on this question of principle Urquhart is correct. What business does a king have in electoral politics?","April 2, 2015","266","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"

"And what about the real Prince Charles, a man who isn’t king yet but who has a royal position and many, many strong opinions—on architecture, organic farming, school reform—along with a tendency to lobby for them? This is one of the questions raised in a decade-long British legal fight over twenty-seven letters that Charles sent to government offices in 2004 and 2005. They are known as the Black Spider Letters, because Charles hand wrote them rather than having them typed up, and his cursive is crawly. He also, reportedly, uses a lot of exclamation marks. That these letters exist at all—that there is someone with a feathered crest on his stationery who commands deference from public officials—enrages British republicans, who think that, at the very least, the government should not respond to or even receive his advice in private. (In addition to pestering British officials, he recently provoked the cancellation of a real-estate development in London, which he objected to on aesthetic grounds, by writing to the Emir of Qatar, who was involved in the financing of it, royal-to-royal.) But the case is also important in trying to determine the strength of the United Kingdom’s Freedom of Information laws and, perhaps even more consequentially, the relationship between the parliamentary government and the courts. The case ended up being very much about which one gets the final say. For Americans, in addition to providing an opportunity for royal voyeurism, it offers some perspective on the ambiguities and the absurdities of dynasties, at a moment in which, in our own political life, we could use some.","268","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"The Guardian’s Rob Evans filed the first request for the newspaper in 2005, asking to see correspondence from September, 2004, to the following April. Britain’s Freedom of Information law was new and, apart from everything else, the paper wanted to test it. (Evans wrote that he was often asked if he’d “been given a tip-off that Charles had sent a particularly controversial letter to a minister” in that period; the “more prosaic” answer was that they’d limited it to eight months because the government could “refuse requests if you ask for too much.”) It was during the subsequent course of litigation that the paper learned that there were letters written in those months to seven departments. Some of the recipients were very Charles, such as the Departments of Culture and of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs. He also wrote to the Northern Ireland Office. In 2012, after several appeals, an Upper Tribunal (which is supposed to have the authority to rule in this area) said that the Guardian could see the letters. At that point, the attorney general, Dominic Grieve—instead of appealing to Britain’s Supreme Court—issued a veto, which he said he could do under Britain’s Freedom of Information law. The problem was that the law said he could do so only if there were “reasonable” grounds, and the Upper Tribunal, looking at that very point, thought there weren’t any. Grieve’s rationale was that the letters were “in many cases particularly frank,” and “contain remarks about public affairs which would in my view, if revealed, have had a material effect upon the willingness of the government to engage in correspondence with the Prince of Wales, and would potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality.” This would make it harder to be king: “The ability of the Monarch to engage with the government of the day, whatever its political colour, and maintain political neutrality is a cornerstone of the UK’s constitutional framework.”","269","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"This is a strange bit of reasoning: the Prince behaved in a way that he probably shouldn’t have, and which would be potentially damaging to his future career as king. As a result, he deserves confidentiality. This is a dangerous fallacy of state secrecy everywhere: that “embarrassing” is synonymous with “damaging to national security,” and that protecting the career of a particular incumbent is the same as protecting the institution. We have certainly heard that in this country.","270","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"But here there isn’t usually such open defiance of courts. (Sometimes there is, as when a C.I.A. official, Jose Rodriguez, shredded videotapes depicting torture, or, more broadly, when states ignore federal rulings.) It took two and a half more years before Britain’s Supreme Court ruled, last week, that the attorney general couldn’t just say that he understood the facts better than the judges did “without real or adequate explanation.” The court’s having the final say is not yet a completely accepted position in Britain: “A decision of a judicial body should be final and binding and should not be capable of being overturned by a member of the executive,” Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, explained in the decision. (“Might this be seen as the case in which the supreme court asserts its authority and comes of age?” Joshua Rozenberg wrote in the Guardian.)","271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"Prime Minster David Cameron’s reaction has been fairly petulant—he says that the government needs time to redact the letters, and that Parliament should also weaken the F.O.I. law to make the veto stronger. That would be a mistake, as the new Parliament, which will come in after the general elections, next month, may decide. (The law has already been altered, with what’s known as the “Prince Charles Amendment,” to make future requests more difficult.) Cameron also said, “This is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government confidentially. I think most people would agree this is fair enough.” That may be true in terms of the Queen, for whom there are formal mechanisms for such confidential exchanges, but “senior members” may be stretching it. (Does Prince Andrew count?) The worry about Charles is not that, at age sixty-six, he will be unprepared for the throne but that he will, to use the verb often associated with him, meddle. Cameron comes from the sort of background where one might be exposed, in the course of things, to the odd duke, but one can see the problem if a junior minister starts getting fancy letters.","272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"This recalls a different set of letters, or e-mails, that have been the subject of debate in this country. The Clintons don’t have a crest on their stationery, but they do have a private server. The Times has also reported that Jeb Bush (who has had a private server of his own) had a tendency to write letters to various departments when his father was Vice-President. This past weekend, Martin O’Malley, the former Governor of Maryland, said on “This Week” that “The Presidency of the United States is not some crown to be passed between two families.” One of the many problems with crowns, as the case of Charles’s letters makes clear, is that there isn’t just a king or a queen but all sorts of princes and duchesses. And Presidents have a lot more power than someone who has actually had a coronation. When politics becomes a family business, the private and the public can get hopelessly confused, in a way that is not helpful in terms of transparency or democracy. What is a missive from Bill Clinton going to mean if Hillary is President—or one from Chelsea? The need for real mechanisms to govern those situations can’t be ignored. Otherwise, the White House might be crawling with Black Spiders.","273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-prince-charles-has-in-common-with-hillary-clinton"
"When Hillary Clinton left the State Department, in 2013, she put her name on the William J. Clinton Foundation. She didn’t have to do it; she had a résumé that required no institutional validation. Now, as she prepares for a possible Presidential campaign, she has to deal with half a dozen new reports on the finances of the Bill, Hillary, & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. In the latest, the foundation acknowledged to the Washington Post that it violated an ethics-review agreement with the State Department by taking half a million dollars from the government of Algeria for Haitian earthquake relief. At the time, Algeria was spending hundred of thousands of dollars to lobby the State Department. The foundation, in its response, said that its donor’s motivation was addressing “critical global challenges.” Algeria just wanted to help Haiti.","February 26, 2015","274","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The first round of stories, in the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post last week, also had to do with the money that the Clinton Foundation took from foreign governments—more than twenty-five million dollars from the Dutch national lottery, between ten and twenty-five million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an unspecified amount of that in 2014. A few days later, the Wall Street Journal did some rough connecting of three dots: first, corporate donations to Clinton-linked charities; second, the lobbying disclosures by those donor-corporations; third, Hillary Clinton’s travels and initiatives as Secretary of State. “At least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation,” it found. While Clinton was “pushing governments to sign deals and change policies to the advantage of corporate giants such as General Electric Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Boeing Co.,” all were among the foundation’s donors. ExxonMobil gave about two million dollars to the Clinton Global Initiative, after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. It gave more than sixteen million dollars to Vital Voices, a charity she co-founded, which promotes women in leadership around the world.","275","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The Journal says that it did not find evidence of a quid pro quo, or any illegality. There are only narratives—Clinton “went to bat” for Boeing in Moscow; Russia bought planes; Boeing made a donation. A Boeing spokeswoman told the Journal that advocating for businesses is what the State Department was supposed to do. The Clinton Foundation, in a statement last Thursday, said, “Contributions are made because the Foundation’s programs improve the lives of millions of people around the globe.”","276","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The foundation does improve lives. But so do a lot of other charities. Why did Algeria or ExxonMobil choose to give this money here? Are the pictures in the annual reports, and at the meetings of the Clinton Global Initiative, more wrenching than in the marketing materials of any other charity, to the point of softening the King of Saudi Arabia’s heart? The Clintons might at least concede the personality-driven nature of the transaction.","277","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"When Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State, the Obama Administration asked the foundation to stop soliciting new donations from foreign governments. It agreed, and then, after she left office, without announcing it, started going out and soliciting from those sources again. Those foreign governments know that Hillary Clinton is almost certainly running for President, as does the rest of the world. In its statement last week, though, the foundation said, “Should Secretary Clinton decide to run for office, we will continue to ensure the Foundation’s policies and practices regarding support from international partners are appropriate, just as we did when she served as Secretary of State”—that is, not yet.","278","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"And the new Washington Post story shows the limits of that “just as we did when she served as Secretary of State.” The Clintons’ ethics agreement allowed existing donors to keep giving, with clearance from the State Department. And so the foundation “accepted millions of dollars from seven foreign governments during Hillary Rodham Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state.” The countries were Algeria, Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Oman, and Qatar. The Post noted that, in the same period, Qatar “spent more than $5.3 million on registered lobbyists.” The foundation, in its response, said that its donors’ motivation was addressing the world’s problems “in a meaningful way.”","279","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"As John Cassidy recently wrote, much of the foundation’s work involves not direct programs (although, along with its affiliates, it does those, too): “Instead, it identifies specific challenges somewhere in the world, solicits commitments from governments and nongovernmental organizations to meet them, finds corporate sponsors willing to finance the projects, and undertakes to help out with expertise, contacts, and encouragement.” This means that a lot of its charitable work consists of making and maintaining connections—Cassidy cites Tom Watson’s suggestion that it operates like an investment bank.* The foundation’s leveraging, though, adds another step that can remove transparency and make it harder for outsiders to get a clear idea of who might be obligated to whom. It also multiplies the amount of money involved. The Journal noted, in its story on the sixty lobbyist-donor companies, “At least 44 of those 60 companies also participated in philanthropic projects valued at $3.2 billion that were set up though a wing of the foundation called the Clinton Global Initiative, which coordinates the projects but receives no cash for them.”","280","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The Clinton Foundation talks about how it is more transparent, as a charity, than it legally needs to be. But it is not a normal charity, in its resources or its functions. The argument in defense of all this is that, if Bill and Hillary have been clumsy, the only ones who have gained anything are the neediest people in the world. (“If the biggest attack on Hillary’s going to be that she raised too much money for her charity, okay, I’ll take that,” Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia and a longtime Clinton associate, told the Post.) In other words, the Clintons owe their donors nothing—they’ve peddled only their charm and their glamour, not their influence. But the foundation also propagates the Clinton brand (Chelsea is vice-chair), and is a place to keep people close and form more connections, or, perhaps, entanglements. One is left hoping that the Clintons are exceptionally ungrateful to their donors.","281","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"All this seems terribly unnecessary. The foundation does a lot of good, and can do more; so can the Clintons, with all their fine talents and intentions, in and out of office. Why push for the marginal, possibly questionable donation or favor, particularly given the scrutiny of a potential campaign? But then, that has always been the mystery of the Clintons.","282","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"The stories do not feel exhaustive. There will be questions about other ways in which the extensive foreign travels in which Clinton took such pride as Secretary of State may have doubled as donor-development drives for the foundation. Democrats may decide not to worry, figuring that the Republican candidate is bound to have his own compromising financial connections. That’s a somewhat sad surrender. When questions about possible improprieties come up, those around the Clintons tend to say that no two people have ever been as vetted as they have, and that was true—around 1998. Pictures can change, with one day or one deal. As far as the Journal could tell, the 2014 donor numbers have not been completely disclosed, and we are two months into 2015. It’s not just the foundation: more stories will be written about paid speeches and consulting contracts. (Politico had one on Wednesday.) A year ago, a Washington Post accounting showed that Bill Clinton had been paid more than a hundred million dollars for speeches since leaving office. Hillary has since begun giving her own paid speeches. They’ve said that they donate some of that money to the foundation. Lately, the whole family seems to be gathering up as much as it can before she declares her candidacy and the family really does have to stop.","283","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-the-clinton-foundation-is-costing-hillary"
"It is past the time for it to stop. The out-of-government, non-candidate fiction has, at this point, run too thin, with a campaign staff being more or less openly mustered.

"On the eve of St. Patrick’s Day, two ascendant politicians—one from Ireland, one from the United States—met in a ballroom at the Essex House, in New York. Hillary Clinton was there to be inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame, in recognition of her “outstanding leadership” in bringing peace to Northern Ireland during the nineteen-nineties, when her husband was President. Gerry Adams, the president of the Irish Republican political party Sinn Fein, was there because for many Americans he is a living symbol of that peace. One of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the decades-long conflict that is known as the Troubles, Adams is very popular in the United States and makes regular trips here to raise funds for his party. (According to a report in the Irish Times, Sinn Fein has raised twelve million dollars in the United States since 1995, from construction companies, labor unions, and movie stars like Angelica Huston and Martin Sheen.)","March 17, 2015","295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/gerry-adams-hillary-clinton-new-york-st-patricks"

"But as I documented in a report for the magazine last week, Adams remains a polarizing figure in Ireland. Though Adams is a longtime figurehead of the Republican movement, he insists that he was never a member of the I.R.A. and that he played no role in the violence of the Troubles. People in Ireland do not actually believe this story, and, in recent years, some of Adams’s former compatriots in the Republican movement have said that he authorized a series of wartime atrocities, including the murder and secret burial of a mother of ten named Jean McConville. Adams has denied these claims, and generally derides those who ask questions about his past as political foes with an agenda or opponents of the peace process.

"“I remember very well when the request came, back in 1993, that my husband approve a visa for Gerry Adams,” Clinton told the crowd at the Essex House. Bill Clinton granted the visa, which was a controversial move at the time, because of Adams’s alleged association with the I.R.A., but also a crucial moment in the peace process, because it helped cement Adams’s transformation from a revolutionary to a statesman. “Absent that first step, that first risk, we might not have had the momentum to move forward, to get to the Good Friday accords and all that has followed,” Clinton said.","298","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/gerry-adams-hillary-clinton-new-york-st-patricks"
"There is no way of knowing whether Clinton, dressed in Kelly green, felt any distaste at the prospect of sharing a table with Adams. There are some thirty-five million Irish Americans, a great many of whom regard Adams as a kind of Nelson Mandela, and no prospective Presidential candidate can decline a St. Patrick’s Day invitation. And, to be sure, the I.R.A. is not alone in standing accused of atrocities during the Troubles: loyalist paramilitary groups and British government forces also perpetrated war crimes for which they have not been brought to account. But Clinton did indicate, obliquely, that the transition in Northern Ireland is not entirely complete. “There is still work to be done,” Clinton acknowledged. “You cannot bring peace and security to people just by signing an agreement.” The question for the people of Northern Ireland, and for Adams’s supporters in the United States, is whether you can bring enduring peace and security without some reckoning—by all parties in the conflict—with the crimes of the past.","299","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/gerry-adams-hillary-clinton-new-york-st-patricks"
"Hillary Rodham entered Wellesley College, in the fall of 1965, as a Goldwater Girl, and left it, in the spring of 1969, as an admirer of the community organizer Saul Alinsky. Today, the story of a young person from Middle America moving to the left while at an élite college is familiar, and back then it was probably even more nearly universal. But it’s also interesting to think about what was going on in the wider political world while Hillary was an undergraduate.","April 23, 2015","300","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"After Lyndon Johnson obliterated Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Presidential election, lots of people assumed that American conservatism was dead—including, who knows, maybe a seventeen-year-old Hillary herself. Then came the 1966 midterm elections, when, riding the “white backlash” against events like the 1965 Watts riots, in Los Angeles, the Republicans made big gains in Congress. In 1968, they took back the White House, in an election that looked closer than it was because a conservative third-party candidate, George Wallace, had siphoned off 13.5 per cent of the vote from Richard Nixon. By the time that Hillary made her celebrated Wellesley commencement speech, endorsing the student protests of the age in a measured, campus-leader tone, she had to have registered that the country was moving in the opposite direction.","301","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"

"Hillary Clinton is the least instinctive of politicians; you can almost see her thinking her way through a situation. The master situation for her, from the time of her political awakening through her early sixties, when she first ran for President, was the difficulty of winning in American politics as a liberal. This may help explain her much-disputed decision to bring in Mark Penn, who made his early reputation by figuring out how to achieve Democratic victories in a Republican era, as her chief strategist in the 2008 campaign. Clinton was obviously not looking for a strategist who could help her connect with voters on the left. If you were writing fiction, it would be too heavily ironic to deal her the fate of being defeated by someone who felt less constrained about owning up to a youthful admiration for Alinsky.","303","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"In the early phases of the 2016 campaign, there is no form of high-end political expertise that Clinton doesn’t have at her disposal—including much of the leadership of the campaign staff that defeated her in 2008. One can only imagine the polls, the focus groups, and the staff retreats that underlay her runic two-minute announcement video—a high-gloss little movie that was devoted to “everyday Americans,” included a bit of rhetoric about the deck being stacked against them, and hardly showed the candidate herself. The clear message was that Clinton has gone from decades of being spooked by the right to, now, being spooked by the left. The video had none of the old, formerly magical symbolic touchpoints of baby-boom liberal politicians who wanted to win: there was no mention of tax cuts, crime-fighting, militarism, or religion, and there were hardly any white males. The only arguably centrist notes struck were a couple of glowing mentions of small business and a very veiled possible reference to charter schools.","304","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"The United States is a big country with a miraculously durable two-party system, which means that each party has to be an unnatural coalition of disparate elements. The Republicans won their big battle of the late twentieth century, which took up most of Hillary Clinton’s adult life, to persuade social conservatives to leave the Democratic Party. But in the process they drove many who were more socially liberal away. And, because the political system is in constant flux, even as the Democratic and Republican parties have become more efficiently liberal and conservative, generating the hyper-partisanship that everyone claims to despise, each has begun to show a new set of internal strains. The Republicans have to try to unite affluent economic conservatives with financially struggling evangelicals. The Democratic Party that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama made, and that Hillary Clinton now inherits, encompasses minorities, labor unions, and single women, plus significant portions of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the broad professional upper-middle class in big metropolitan areas, especially on the coasts. (The historic home of the Bush family, Greenwich, Connecticut, is now represented in Congress by a Democrat.) The Democrats’ diversity enables them to achieve rough financial parity with the Republicans, but it has to be tricky to manage.","305","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"The announcement video indicates that the Clinton campaign believes that in this cycle, the core appeal to Democratic and potentially Democratic voters has to be based on economics. Voters want to hear that the generation-long stall-out of the American working and middle classes’ fortunes is somehow going to end. The problem is that, right now, the Democratic coalition seems to be in agreement on the formerly radioactive social issues—ethnicity, sexuality, values—but not on the economic issues that will define the election. In the video you can detect the hope that it will be possible to declare that the campaign is all about economics, and then to spend it talking mainly about other things. Does Hillary Clinton want to raise taxes on the rich? More heavily regulate financial institutions? Make unions more politically powerful? Throw some sand in the gears of globalization by restricting free trade? These are the kinds of questions that have historically gone along with an overriding concern with the welfare of “everyday Americans,” but they are not pleasant ones for the campaign, because in each case, a clear answer would alienate an element of the Democratic Party.","306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"
"Don’t think of this problem as being only about Clinton’s keeping the Elizabeth Warren wing of her party on board through the nomination. Last week, John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, who’s thinking of jumping into the Presidential race, made a point of going on national television and complaining at some length about “greed” on Wall Street. That indicates that he thinks there may be a way to run against both Clinton and Jeb Bush on what might be called Main Street economics, from within the Republican Party. Exactly what to say about the tough economic situation faced by most Americans could be as tricky for Clinton in the general election as it will be in the primary season. Her policy team is no doubt as well stocked as her message team, and it may have the tougher job.","307","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-looks-left"

"When the news broke that Hillary Clinton had leased space in Brooklyn, likely for her Presidential campaign headquarters, the predictable jokes rolled in. “Hip Hillary,” the American Spectator wrote, is “embracing the organic, handcrafted vegan latte and handlebar mustache lifestyle of trendy Brooklyn.” In fact, Clinton is setting up shop not in “cool Brooklyn” but on two floors of an office building at One Pierrepont Plaza, in Brooklyn Heights. That’s kind of a no man’s land, on the border of the domain of thousand-dollar Bugaboo strollers and where you go for jury duty. Locals refer to Brooklyn Heights (with pride) as “America’s first suburb”—it’s the Chappaqua of Kings County.","331","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/hillaryburg"
"“I think she’s not likely to furnish it with a host of bearded men, vintage chesterfield sofas, and fridges full of Brooklyn Lager,” David Alhadeff, the founder of the Williamsburg boutique the Future Perfect, said. “I don’t think she’ll be dumpster diving for her office chairs.” But while Clinton probably won’t embrace the craft-based aesthetic for which Brooklyn has become known, he recommended that she explore other local trends, such as a “return to Memphis” (the Italian design movement of the nineteen-eighties, not the city in Tennessee), with “avant-garde linoleums and bright colors.”","332","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/hillaryburg"
"Clinton could hardly do worse than the de Blasios, who, last summer, replaced antiques in Gracie Mansion on which Mayor Michael Bloomberg had spent several million dollars with sixty-five thousand dollars’ worth of free furniture from West Elm: dusty-blue sectionals, furry throw pillows. A Times Op-Ed called the decision to accept the swag “unseemly.” The First Family defended the choice by pointing out that West Elm had started in Brooklyn, like them. (The company is a subsidiary of the San Francisco-based Williams-Sonoma.) Also to avoid: emulating the Illinois Republican congressman Aaron Schock, whose decorator kitted out his office to evoke “Downton Abbey,” with crimson walls, gold sconces, and clumps of pheasant feathers, at a cost of forty thousand taxpayer dollars.","333","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/hillaryburg"
"“In political culture, design is not a priority,” said Martin Finio, an architect who, with his wife, revamped the Brooklyn Historical Society. He suggested that Clinton avoid wall-to-wall carpet and plastic laminate, and that she find “some way to bring in real good Brooklyn co-op food—not pizza and Diet Coke.” Francesca Connolly, a co-founder of the Web site Remodelista, who lives in a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights, floated the idea of giving staffers D.I.Y. standing desks and investing in dry-erase paint, so they could write on the walls.","334","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/hillaryburg"
"Then there are all the furniture shops along Atlantic Avenue. The other day, a bearded, beanie-wearing employee at Horseman Antiques, a five-story emporium, recommended Wegner-style Mid-century chairs—“Wegner chairs have been used in the Oval Office,” he said—or a twenty-five-hundred-dollar bronze eagle. Nearby, at the City Foundry, a saleswoman pitched “a proper Federal mirror” (gold, convex glass, twelve hundred dollars) and a campaign desk by Milo Baughman (forty-eight hundred dollars). “It’s modern and stately, but chic,” she said.","335","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/hillaryburg"
"Christopher Hyland, a luxury textile merchant with a taste for the Greek and the Gothic, served as the deputy national political director on Bill Clinton’s first Presidential campaign. (They met at Georgetown, where Hyland worked on Bill’s unsuccessful bid for student-council president.) “I think of Thomas Jefferson as my inspiration,” Hyland said. “He designed window treatments, and he designed silver and furniture, and he designed a building, Monticello.” Hyland recalled that Hillary had once asked him if he’d redecorate the White House. He declined, and in 1993 Kaki Hockersmith, formerly employed by an Arkansas Dillard’s, took on the job. The result, which the Times likened to “a sort of underlit ‘Age of Innocence’ with a lot of makeup,” was a far cry from the work that Jacqueline Kennedy had commissioned from Stéphane Boudin.","336","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/hillaryburg"
"Maybe it’s best to look to the future. Clinton could go the tech route, embracing nap pods and office slides. Kickstarter’s headquarters, in Greenpoint, have an art gallery and a movie theatre. Brad Sherman, an interior designer who works with startups, said, “A lot of these companies can’t afford to hire the best talent, so how do they recruit the best talent? They have the coolest spaces.” By contrast, he recalled seeing photographs of Barack Obama’s dreary headquarters: “dropped ceilings, fluorescent lighting, nothing exciting about it, except maybe a few people sitting on those exercise balls.”","337","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/20/hillaryburg"
"For Clinton, Sherman envisaged “soft tones.” He implied that she might even be able to overcome issues of relatability through design. “You shape your space, and then your space will eventually shape you,” he said. “It shouldn’t be overly streamlined or stripped of character, which is maybe how people perceive Hillary.

"Hillary Clinton’s official announcement that she is running for President is great news for comedy. It means that, among other things, there will be months and months, and perhaps years and years, of Kate McKinnon’s Hillary Clinton impersonation on “Saturday Night Live.” The thirty-one-year-old McKinnon has played Clinton just three times, most notably last month and then again this past Saturday night, but her Clinton is already among the best impersonations of a politician ever to appear on the show—joining a list of greats that includes Dana Carvey as George H. W. Bush, Phil Hartman and Darrell Hammond as Bill Clinton, Will Ferrell as George W. Bush, and Tina Fey as Sarah Palin.","April 13, 2015","339","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kate-mckinnons-genius-hillary-impersonation"
"","340","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kate-mckinnons-genius-hillary-impersonation"
"In Saturday’s opening sketch, McKinnon plays Hillary as she prepares her campaign video with the help of an assistant. The joke is that Hillary cannot approximate any of the basic emotional notes that are required—humility, geniality, relatability. McKinnon’s Hillary is stiff and robotic, but also, almost at the very same time, full of sexuality and swagger. She has a detached, regal bearing, like a queen who is a little confused by the contemporary mores of her country. (Rather than asking for a high five, she tells her assistant, “Meet my hand in the air.”) But she is also silly and strange; doing some vocal warmups for the video shoot, she sings, “Hillary’s a granny with a twinkle in her eye. Hillary’s a granny and she makes an apple pie.” She has crazy eyes and a maniacal laugh, both of which point to a kind of bad-Shakespeare madness at the center of the character. On her first try at a low-key announcement to voters, she grabs the camera and shouts, “Citizens, you will elect me—I will be your leader.”","341","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kate-mckinnons-genius-hillary-impersonation"
"McKinnon’s broad flourishes are so memorable that it’s easy to miss that her baseline Hillary, her resting Hillary, is so spot-on. In her appearance in March, the hallmarks were already there: the head tilt, the smile, the precise elocution, the weariness at having to explain things to people. It is a performance that builds on a studied impersonation to become a singular new character. It has helped, also, that these sketches have been especially well written. The first addressed the e-mail scandal and mocked Hillary’s coyness about whether she would run; Saturday’s managed to effectively satirize the themes of Hillary’s announcement video before it had even been released. “Aren’t we such a fun, approachable dynasty,” McKinnon’s Hillary says at one point. It’s a good line, and McKinnon makes it funnier by making it a statement, not a question. Even the reappearance of Hammond on Saturday night as Bill Clinton (complete with a sax solo) couldn’t upstage McKinnon’s preternatural impersonation.","342","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kate-mckinnons-genius-hillary-impersonation"
"“Saturday Night Live” has been impersonating Hillary for nearly twenty-five years, with versions played by Jan Hooks, Janeane Garofalo, Ana Gasteyer, Amy Poehler, and Vanessa Bayer. Of these performances, it was Poehler’s, during the 2008 Presidential campaign, that stood out. Poehler’s Hillary was more of the Chevy Chase school of political impressions: it was less about Clinton’s appearance (other than the hair) or mannerisms than about a popular idea of Clinton—in this case, the idea that she was disgusted with the American electorate for failing to recognize her obvious qualifications and abilities. In this sense, the caricature was mostly admiring, and an early version of the character Leslie Knope that Poehler would play on the television show “Parks and Recreation”: the smartest woman, and person, in the room. The real joke was on a political system that would exclude Hillary but elevate Sarah Palin—a point that was emphasized during what was the best sketch of the 2008 cycle, in which Poehler’s Hillary and Fey’s Palin stood side by side to decry sexism in politics. As funny as Poehler was, her Clinton was mostly a foil for the Fey-as-Palin cultural phenomenon.","343","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kate-mckinnons-genius-hillary-impersonation"
"Hillary was said to have admired Poehler’s impression. It’s unlikely that she, or her political handlers, will find much to like in McKinnon’s. Like Poehler, McKinnon satirizes Hillary’s frustrated will to power, but in her version Hillary seems to have spent the past eight years nursing that particular grudge to the point that it has grown into a fully formed split personality. McKinnon’s Hillary gapes and grimaces, contorting her face in an effort not merely to appear at ease and “relatable” but to keep the other Hillary—the spurned, bitter, and crazed version—from coming out.","344","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kate-mckinnons-genius-hillary-impersonation"
"The real Hillary has shown herself to have a better sense of humor than she may get credit for. But, for the campaign, McKinnon’s monster will be difficult either to embrace or defuse. It is hard to imagine the real Hillary appearing alongside her deranged double without some of McKinnon’s captivating madness rubbing off on the candidate. While the impression is based on the premise of Hillary’s competence, it also promotes some of the most durable and, in many ways, sexist, popular tropes about her: that she is narcissistic, grasping (in her first performance, McKinnon literally grabs at the air), shrill, and, at this late stage, desperate for the office. Voters have come to expect politicians to laugh at their real or alleged foibles—Obama has made about seven hundred Kenya jokes since he became President. But how is Hillary supposed to laugh at this?","345","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kate-mckinnons-genius-hillary-impersonation"
"McKinnon’s performance on Saturday was toned down just a touch from the one a month ago, without losing any of its startling intensity. It will likely continue to deepen, and, as it does, to find points of empathy with the real person upon whom it is based. As the novelist Jacob Rubin wrote recently at Slate, in an appreciation of Dana Carvey’s Bush impression, a good impersonation “does not seem like a studied replication so much as an emotional communion.” There was the germ of that communion on Saturday, when Hammond’s Bill Clinton remarked that if people could have shot video on their phones in the nineties, he’d be in jail. McKinnon’s Hillary freezes her face into a smile and says, flatly, “Great, Bill, I love jokes about that.” Having established the outer limits of her impression, it will be fun to watch as McKinnon works in the smaller spaces.","346","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kate-mckinnons-genius-hillary-impersonation"

"Nearly eight years ago, Democrats held their first televised Presidential debate of the 2008 campaign, marking the debut of a cast of characters that ranged from the plausible to the preposterous. For two hours, the candidates, some of them now remembered only by those with an unhealthy attachment to politics, went at it as the moderator, NBC’s Brian Williams, made game attempts to nudge them into saying something interesting. The most incautious remarks came from former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel and former Representative Dennis Kucinich, both of whom had nothing to lose and knew it. When Williams asked for reactions to Senator Harry Reid’s remark that “the war in Iraq is lost,” Gravel replied, “Well, first off, understand that this war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis.” Kucinich talked about impeaching Dick Cheney. The leading competitors were simply careful. Senator Joe Biden said, “Look, Brian, this is not a game show. You know, this is not a football game. This is not win or lose. The fact of the matter is that the President has a fundamentally flawed policy.” Senator Hillary Clinton said, “Well, Brian, at the outset let me say that the American people have spoken; the Congress has voted, as of today, to end this war. And now we can only hope that the President will listen. … This is not America’s war to win or lose. We have given the Iraqi people the chance to have freedom, to have their own country.” Senator Barack Obama said, “Well, Brian, I am proud that I opposed this war from the start, because I thought that it would lead to the some—the disastrous conditions that we’ve seen on the ground in Iraq.”","April 3, 2015","367","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"

"The other debate participants included the former Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd, the former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, and the former senator and Vice-Presidential candidate John Edwards. They have faded from the scene, in Edwards’s case not in a good way. Yet most of the topics—gay marriage, climate change, immigration reform, and Iraq—are still with us. Hillary Clinton is still being asked to defend her 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq-war resolution, and still sounds much as she did when she said, “Well, Brian, I take responsibility for my vote. … It was a sincere vote based on the information available to me. And I’ve said many times that if I knew then what I now know, I would not have voted that way.” At the same time, Clinton brought real conviction and knowledge to discussions of universal health care, a central issue in 2008 that is still with us. Those Democrats acted like a party engaged by issues and eager to win back the White House.","369","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"That’s how the Republicans are behaving this year—eager. The candidacy of Ted Cruz, possible encores by Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum, the emergence of Rand Paul, and a “center” represented by Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, and even Lindsey Graham may induce Romney nostalgia for horror-struck Democrats. But it’s a race that’s bound to become ever more compelling, possibly with more candidates (Ben Carson? Carly Fiorina?), and the contenders will be sharpened in the process. They’re looking for a contender, just as the Democrats were eight years ago, when debates and primaries altered early perceptions that Clinton, or possibly Edwards, was bound to win.","370","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"Democrats, meanwhile, seem ready to cede the whole thing to Clinton, who, for all her experience and intelligence, may be a less-than-ideal candidate. Even her e-mail problems, which polls at first suggested could be shrugged off, aren’t going away. It didn’t help when her lawyer, David Kendall, in response to a subpoena from a congressional committee looking into the 2012 attack on the American Embassy in Benghazi, told the Times, “There are no hdr22@clintonemail.com emails from Secretary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized.” That her personal e-mail server has been wiped clean of any records from her years at the State Department erases the chance of anyone ever making an independent study of their contents and is bound to encourage the suspicion that there was something worth hiding. The investigation community is like a perpetual scandal-seeking machine, quick to seize on any hint of inconsistency, and both Clintons, understandably, are weary of being pursued by those who don’t wish them well. But the public may be getting weary of seeing the words “Clinton” and “lawyers” juxtaposed yet again with any sort of frequency, which could explain her slippage in the polls in three battleground states.","371","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"Not long ago, Ryan Lizza wrote about Clinton’s aura of inevitability and the historic failure of most challenges to strong front-runners. At this point, though, any insurgencies are more notional than real. Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, has been gently critical of her as he shyly contemplates getting into the race. The former Virginia Senator James Webb, who began exploring a run last November, is still hinting that he intends to run. But when you look for signs of the Webb campaign, which promised a fresh view of income inequality, military commitments abroad, and the terrible waste of lives—mainly black lives—caused by mass incarceration, what you’re likely to find is the status of the James Webb space telescope, which will replace the Hubble. (That Webb ran NASA in the years of the Apollo program.) Clinton, meanwhile, has not exactly announced her intentions, but her campaign, without coyness, has reportedly leased two floors of office space in Brooklyn Heights, and that, as Politico notes, may be regarded by the Federal Election Commission as the beginning of a campaign.","372","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"Four years ago, Democrats were amused by the Republicans battling through the primaries, and by debates that even Republicans considered a “clown show.” This year, Republicans may be cheered by the absence of battle on the other side, by the sight of a major political party diminished by timidity and the uncertain candidacy of a single contender.","373","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lonely-clinton-campaign"
"The Times has reported that people involved in a series of Canadian uranium-mining deals channelled money to the Clinton Foundation while the firm had business before the State Department. And, in one case, a Russian investment bank connected to the deals paid money to Bill Clinton personally, through a half-million-dollar speaker’s fee. There were a number of transactions involved, and corporate name changes, but, basically, a Canadian company known as Uranium One initially wanted American diplomats to defend its Kazakh uranium interests when a Russian firm, Rosatom, seemed about to make a move on them; and then, after the company decided to simply let Rosatom acquire it (through Rosatom’s alarmingly named subsidiary, ARMZ), Uranium One needed State Department approval. (The approval was necessary because Uranium One controlled American uranium mines and exploration fields, a strategic asset.)","April 24, 2015","374","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"

"The Times sums it up this way:","376","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"The Times says that the donations were not properly disclosed—the paper confirmed them by looking at Canadian tax records. Complicating matters, Uranium One’s corporate forebear had acquired the Kazakh interests after its major shareholder, Frank Giustra, travelled with Bill Clinton to Kazakhstan in 2005 and met with the country’s leader. Giustra sold his interest in the company in 2007, according to the Times, and so was not involved in the ARMZ dealings. But Giustra has put tens of millions of dollars into the foundation’s work; the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, which bears his name, is a formal component of the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. And Ian Telfer, the Uranium One chairman, whose family foundation donated the $2.35 million dollars, said that it had done so because he wanted to support that coöperation: “Frank and I have been friends and business partners for almost 20 years.” He told the Wall Street Journal that he’d pledged the money in 2008, before the sale was on the table. Telfer also said that he’d never talked about uranium with Hillary Clinton. After the story came out, Giustra issued an angry statement, calling it baseless speculation and “an attempt to tear down Secretary Clinton and her presidential campaign.” He added a note of Canadian admonishment: “You are a great country. Don’t ruin it by letting those with political agendas take over your newspapers and your airwaves.”","377","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, told the Times, “To suggest the State Department, under then-Secretary Clinton, exerted undue influence in the U.S. government’s review of the sale of Uranium One is utterly baseless.” There have been reports that other companies—Boeing, for example—gave money to the foundation while Clinton was Secretary of State and they had business before the department. The Uranium One story is more troubling, and potentially damaging, because of the personal ties, the foreign interests, the opacity, and the denouement, which involves Putin allies publicly gloating over Russia’s increased dominance of the world’s uranium supplies. The Times was tipped off to the story by a forthcoming book, “Clinton Cash,” by Peter Schweizer, which a Clinton campaign spokesman has called a “smear project.” The Clinton people and others argue that Schweizer has an expressly conservative agenda, visible in his previous work, and ties to Republican candidates. The Times’ public editor, Margaret Sullivan, addressing those concerns, said that, though she was troubled by the way the Times had described its relationship with Schweizer as “exclusive,” the paper had done its own reporting, and the story addressed valid questions about a Presidential candidate.","378","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"Here are five:","379","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"1. Was there a quid pro quo? Based on the Times reporting, there was certainly a lot of quid (millions in donations that made it to a Clinton charity; a half-million-dollar speaker’s fee) and multiple quos (American diplomatic intervention with the Russians; approvals when the Russian firm offered a very “generous” price for Uranium One). The Clinton perspective is that, although the approvals were delivered by the State Department when Clinton led it, there is no evidence that she personally delivered them, or of the “pro” in the equation. The Clinton campaign, in its response to the Times, noted that other agencies also had a voice in the approval process, and gave the Times a statement from someone on the approvals committee saying that Clinton hadn’t “intervened.” The Clinton spokesman wouldn’t comment on whether Clinton was briefed about the matter. She was cc’d on a cable that mentioned the request for diplomatic help, but if there is a note in which she follows up with a directive—an e-mail, say—the Times doesn’t seem to have it.","380","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"This speaks to some larger questions about political corruption. How do you prove it? Maybe the uranium people simply cared deeply about the undeniably good work the foundation is doing, and would have received the help and approvals anyway. In cases like this, though, how does the public maintain its trust? Doing so becomes harder when the money is less visible, which leads to the second question:","381","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"2. Did the Clintons meet their disclosure requirements? The Times writes, of the $2.35 million from Telfer’s family foundation, “Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors.” This is one of the more striking details in the story, because it seems so clear-cut that the donation ought to have been disclosed. Moreover, the Times says that the foundation did not explain the lapse. I also asked the foundation to explain its reasoning. The picture one is left with is convoluted and, in the end, more troubling than if the lapse had been a simple oversight. The legalisms can be confusing, so bear with me: the Clinton Foundation has several components, including the Clinton Global Initiative and—this is the key one—the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, formerly known as the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative. The memorandum of understanding makes it clear that the donor-disclosure requirement applies to each part of the foundation.","382","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"Craig Minassian, a Clinton Foundation spokesman, pointed out, though, that there are two legally separate but almost identically named entities: the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership and the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada). The second one is a Canadian charitable vehicle that Giustra set up—doing it this way helps Canadian donors get tax benefits. It also, to the foundation’s mind, obliterates the disclosure requirements. (There are also limits on what a Canadian charity is allowed to disclose.) Minassian added, “As complex as they may seem, these programs were set up to do philanthropic work with maximum impact, period. Critics will say what they want, but that doesn’t change the facts that these social enterprise programs are addressing poverty alleviation and other global challenges in innovative ways.” Minassian compared the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) to entirely independent nonprofits, like AmFAR or Malaria no More, which have their own donors and then give money to the foundation’s work.","383","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"This does not make a lot of sense unless you have an instinct for the most legalistic of legalisms. Unlike AmFAR, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) has the Clinton name on it. Money given to the Canadian entity goes exclusively to the foundation. Per an agency agreement, all of its work is done by the foundation, too. The Web site that has the C.G.E.P. name on it also has the Clinton Foundation logo and Bill Clinton’s picture; it also has a copyright notice naming the Canadian entity as the site’s owner. Anyone visiting the site would be justifiably confused. They are, in other words, effectively intermingled.","384","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"And what would it mean if the Canadian explanation flew—that the Clintons could allow a foreign businessman to set up a foreign charity, bearing their name, through which people in other countries could make secret multi-million-dollar donations to their charity’s work? That structural opacity calls the Clintons’ claims about disclosure into question. If the memorandum of understanding indeed allowed for that, it was not as strong a document as the public was led to believe—it is precisely the sort of entanglement one would want to know about. (In that way, the Canadian charity presents some of the same transparency issues as a super PAC.) At the very least, it is a reckless use of the Clinton name, allowing others to trade on it.","385","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"3. Did the Clintons personally profit? In most stories about dubious foundation donors, the retort from Clinton supporters is that the only beneficiaries have been the world’s poorest people. This ignores the way vanity and influence are their own currencies—but it is an argument, and the foundation does some truly great work. In this case, though, Bill Clinton also accepted a five-hundred-thousand-dollar speaking fee for an event in Moscow, paid for by a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin. That was in June, 2010, the Times reports, “the same month Rosatom struck its deal for a majority stake in Uranium One”—a deal that the Russian bank was promoting and thus could profit from. Did Bill Clinton do anything to help after taking their money? The Times doesn’t know. But there is a bigger question: Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State? In a separate story, breaking down some of the hundred million dollars in speaking fees that Bill Clinton has collected, the Washington Post notes, “The multiple avenues through which the Clintons and their causes have accepted financial support have provided a variety of ways for wealthy interests in the United States and abroad to build friendly relations with a potential future president.”","386","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"4. Putting aside who got rich, did this series of uranium deals damage or compromise national security? That this is even a question is one reason the story is, so to speak, radioactive. According to the Times, “the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States.” Pravda has said that it makes Russia stronger. What that means, practically, is something that will probably be debated as the election proceeds.","387","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"5. Is this cherry-picking or low-hanging fruit? Put another way, how many more stories about the Clintons and money will there be before we make it to November, 2016? The optimistic view, if you support Hillary Clinton or are simply depressed by meretriciousness, is that the Times reporters combed the Schweizer book and that this story was the worst they found. The pessimistic view is that it was an obvious one to start with, for all the reasons above, and that some names that stand out less than Uranium One and ARMZ will lead to other stories. Are the Clintons correct in saying that there is an attack machine geared up to go after them? Of course. But why have they made it so easy?","388","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company"
"With the National Guard patrolling the streets of Baltimore, the crisis of policing in minority communities has already merged with the 2016 Presidential campaign. On Wednesday morning, Hillary Clinton went to Columbia University and spoke at a policy forum named after David Dinkins, New York City’s first black Mayor. She went somewhat beyond the remarks that President Obama delivered at the White House on Tuesday, calling for an end to mass incarceration, especially of young black men, and for the mandatory use of body cameras by the police.","April 29, 2015","389","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Over the coming days and weeks, the merits of Clinton’s proposals will be subjected to closer analysis, and the politics of the issue will be chewed over in exhaustive detail. Before that, though, it’s worth looking at what Obama and Clinton said in their speeches, which was pretty striking. The President, who has been criticized by some black intellectuals and media figures for striking too timid a pose on race relations, asked Americans to confront the long history of minority deaths at the hands of the police, saying, “We, as a country, have to do some soul-searching. … This is not new. It has been going on for decades.” Clinton, in a speech that lasted about half an hour, also told some harsh truths. Indeed, she used almost that exact phrase, saying, “We have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America.”","390","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Words are only words, of course, welcome as they are. In a country where police forces are run locally and the Republicans control Congress, bringing about real change will be a big challenge. But, with camera phones and social media helping to highlight incidents that otherwise would have passed largely unnoticed, something significant does appear to be happening. Out of the protests, the anger, and the saturation media coverage, the kernel of a long-overdue urban agenda is emerging—one that is centered on reforms to policing and the criminal-justice system, but that also acknowledges the broader social, economic, and racial realities that make up what Gunnar Myrdal, more than seventy years ago, called “An American Dilemma.” In pursuing such an agenda, words and speeches aren’t sufficient, but they are certainly necessary.","391","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Having been curiously quiet over the weekend, despite protests and arrests on Saturday in Baltimore over the death, in police custody, of Freddie Gray, Obama had to come out and condemn the violence that took place following Gray’s funeral, on Monday, which he did in unequivocal terms. “When individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot, they’re not protesting. … They’re stealing,” he said, adding, “They need to be treated as criminals.” But the President also acknowledged the peaceful protestors who had taken to the streets before the violence started, noting that they had legitimate concerns about the deaths of Gray and other young black men—concerns he linked to the urban decay and neglect that has blighted America’s reputation for at least half a century. One particular passage is, I think, worth quoting in full:","392","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Clinton, for her part, wasn’t coming to this issue fresh. Three weeks ago, after a South Carolina cop repeatedly shot in the back a black man named Walter Scott, who was running away after being stopped for a faulty taillight, she tweeted, “Praying for #WalterScott’s family. Heartbreaking & too familiar. We can do better – rebuild trust, reform justice system, respect all lives.” At Columbia, she began in a similar vein, saying, “Yet again, the family of a young black man is grieving a life cut short. Yet again, the streets of an American city are marred by violence.”","393","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"She continued:","394","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"This was emotive stuff. But what did she think should be done? She called a recent report by a Presidential task force that was appointed in the wake of riots over the police shooting of Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri, last year, “a good place to start.” However, she seemed keen to move beyond the report’s recommendations, which stopped short of calling, for example, for the mandatory use of police cameras, or for limiting police use of paramilitary equipment. Clinton said that body cameras should be the norm, arguing that this would “protect good people on both sides of the lens,” and said that public money should be used to “bolster best practices,” rather than spent on “weapons of war that have no place on our streets.”","395","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Like Obama, Clinton was also careful to stress the broader context. “You cannot talk about smart policing and reforming the criminal-justice system if you also don’t talk about what’s needed to provide economic opportunity,” she said. But perhaps the most newsworthy aspect of the speech was a call for “a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe.” Noting that America has five per cent of the world’s population but twenty-five per cent of its prisoners, and that roughly one and a half million African-American men are missing from their communities and families because they are incarcerated, Clinton said, “We don’t want to create another incarceration generation.”","396","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"In calling for big reductions in the number of prisoners, Clinton was distancing herself from her husband’s legacy—in 1994, at the height of the “drug war,” he signed legislation that lengthened sentences for drug offenders and provided more federal money for prison construction. But times have changed, and so has the political environment: these days, even some Republicans agree that far too many Americans, particularly Americans of color, are languishing in jail for minor offenses. Texas, a solidly Republican state, is reducing sentences, closing prisons, and funding alternative programs. In a sense, the national debate is merely catching up with local initiatives, some of which are cost-driven.","397","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"
"Still, after the riots in Ferguson and Baltimore, it is surely encouraging to see the President and the leading Democratic candidate to replace him speaking so forcefully, and confronting the “lock ’em up” mentality that has dominated the public debate for so long. “I don’t want the discussion about criminal justice, smart policing, to be siloed, and to permit discussions and arguments and debates about it to only talk about that,” Clinton said. “The conversation needs to be much broader. Because that is a symptom, not a cause, of what ails us today.” In the next nineteen months, Clinton will give many speeches. But she might not speak a truer sentence than that last one.","398","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/baltimore-obama-and-clinton-an-agenda-emerges"

"","409","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-clintonian-theory-of-foreign-money"
"The answer seems to lie in a certain conception of what corruption is, and isn’t. The choice of countries whose money is good is telling: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway can all continue to give money, as they have been doing. The countries that, though they’ve given money in the past two years, will have to wrap up their business include Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Other non-approved past donor countries are Algeria, Brunei, the Dominican Republic, Italy, Kuwait, and Taiwan. The foundation’s statement on the change, on its Web site, does not specify the reasons that some made the cut and others didn’t. Perhaps the rationale is, as many press reports assumed, a guess about each country’s potential for controversy. Voters might not mind a picture of Bill hanging out with Crown Prince Haakon of Norway as much as one with the Sultan of Brunei. And there are particular reasons to avoid taking money from authoritarians, or states that ignore, say, women’s rights, which Clinton is making one of her signature issues. “British funds” in a headline does have a different ring from “Saudi cash.” But either could still be rendered as “foreign cash,” and that remains, at the very least, indecorous when one is running for President. Beyond appearances, the theory seems to be that nice countries, like nice, respectable, well-situated people, are not corrupt. For a transaction to be corrupt, from this perspective, one of the parties has to be in some way marginal, whether financially, politically, socially, or ideologically. The Dutch are doing fine—they don’t need anything, and it’s inappropriate to question their generosity. The Clintons are doing well, too; Bill has earned more than a hundred million dollars in speaker fees, and the Clinton Foundation has taken in more than two billion dollars from various sources. They don’t need the Dutch. The very surfeit of money is taken as a guarantee of honesty. One could call it a Clintonian view, except that it is, increasingly, an American one.","410","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-clintonian-theory-of-foreign-money"
"And yet even northern Europeans have policy priorities. So do billionaires who might otherwise be said to have everything; what donors want can be different from what, objectively, they might need. It is wrong to ignore the way a world view, or simple access, can be bought and sold. This is true of campaign finance across the board, but there is something particularly disorienting about the size and geographic scope of the Clinton operation. And it is strange, going into the 2016 Presidential campaign, that Hillary Clinton isn’t more wary of that.","411","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-clintonian-theory-of-foreign-money"
"Instead, the Clintons act as though the injustice of the second-guessing about the foundation’s finances—and the family’s own—is manifest. Every time there is a story about the foundation’s money, its spokesmen emphasize that it exceeds legal requirements for transparency. One change, with Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign, is that it will now release the names of its donors quarterly, rather than annually; she is also stepping down from the board. A spokesman told the Journal, “By implementing this new, even stronger and more transparent policy, the Clinton Foundation is reinforcing its commitment to accountability while protecting programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around the world.” Attack the fund-raising, in other words, and you are attacking efforts to help the poor. Presented with a conflict, the Clintons just don’t seem to see why they should have to make a choice.","412","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-clintonian-theory-of-foreign-money"
"A couple of weeks ago, the Times had a story about how Eaglevale Partners, the hedge fund co-founded by Chelsea Clinton’s husband, Marc Mezvinsky, had investors who were also supporters of the Clintons. The people the paper spoke to emphasized that the amounts in question were not large, in terms of the fund, which managed four hundred million dollars—one person had put in a million, for example, suggesting, again, that people in the Clintons’ circles have lost track of what is a large or a small amount. And, the Times noted, “Clinton supporters also say there are more direct ways to cultivate favor with the family, such as giving to the foundation, where Chelsea Clinton is vice chairwoman, than by investing with a hedge fund that her husband co-founded.” There has long been a belief in American politics that a wealthy person who runs for office is more likely to be honest because bribes won’t tempt him—this is the Bloomberg model. What is distinct about the Clintons is that their wealth comes from such sources as speaking fees, book advances, and board memberships—that is, from trading in on their political aura and experience, if not simply selling access. That may be what Presidential retirement looks like. But it creates certain conceptual and ethical difficulties, and Hillary Clinton can’t ignore that.","413","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-clintonian-theory-of-foreign-money"
"When Clinton served as Secretary of State, the foundation had a policy limiting foreign-government money to avoid conflicts, but there were plenty of gaps, and at least one case in which the rules were broken. (It involved Algeria, and the foundation said that it was an oversight.) Those limits were dropped when she left State, which was also when she added her name to the foundation. Because loopholes seem to matter, here are a few: under the new policy, foreign governments can still pay for their ministers to attend the Clinton Global Initiative; that costs twenty thousand dollars a person, and, again, the Clinton defense might be that, though this seems like significant money, it’s not, really, in the context of the C.G.I. And the rules have to do with government entities, not foreigners per se. Of course, the distinction between public officials and people with influence can be vague in some countries, including this one.","414","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-clintonian-theory-of-foreign-money"

"Last month, Saudi Arabia abruptly cut ties with Sweden, recalling its ambassador and announcing that it would issue no new visas to Swedish business travelers. The cause, according to Saudi Arabia, was some remarks made by Margot Wallström, the foreign minister of Sweden.","April 15, 2015","423","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström, a sixty-year-old Social Democrat who has spent almost her entire career in politics, was appointed foreign minister last fall, when Prime Minister Stefan Löfven took office. She immediately announced that she intended to pursue a feminist foreign policy and went on to explain, in a talk in the U.S., that “striving toward gender equality is not only a goal in itself but also a precondition for achieving our wider foreign, development, and security-policy objectives.”","424","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"On February 11th, Wallström, speaking before the Swedish parliament, stated what may appear to be a few facts about Saudi Arabia: she said that women are not allowed to drive, that their human rights are violated, and that the country is a dictatorship in which the royal family has absolute power. Like representatives of several other European countries, she also criticized the public flogging of the blogger Raif Badawi and later called it “medieval.”","425","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström, whose government recognized the State of Palestine last year, had been asked to deliver a speech at an Arab League summit in Cairo in late March, but Saudi Arabia intervened, and Wallström was disinvited. On March 9th, Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Sweden, saying that Wallström had “unacceptably interfered” in the country’s internal affairs. The United Arab Emirates followed suit a week later. Due to Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic wrangling, Wallström was also condemned by the Gulf Cooperation Council (which consists of Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the U.A.E.), The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which includes fifty-seven countries, and the Arab League itself. Finally, Saudi Arabia leveled a more serious charge against Wallström: that by commenting on the punishment of public flogging, the Swedish foreign minister had criticized Sharia law and Islam.","426","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"In the midst of an escalating diplomatic crisis, the Swedish government was due to decide on another issue that concerned Saudi Arabia, a very sticky one. Sweden is not only one of Europe’s largest per-capita donors of foreign aid (its foreign ministry likes to describe the nation as “a humanitarian superpower”) but also one of its largest per-capita arms exporters. Even with strict laws meant to prevent exports to countries involved in violent conflicts or suspected of committing human-rights offenses, some loopholes made it possible for Sweden to retain Saudi Arabia as a long-standing and lucrative arms client. In recent years, though, the relationship became increasingly uncomfortable for Swedish public officials; in 2012, the defense minister was forced to resign when public radio revealed a secret plan to build a weapons plant in Saudi Arabia.","427","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Sweden’s Social Democrats have historically taken a pragmatic view of the government-subsidized arms industry and its often-opaque dealings abroad. But when a new, left coalition government came to power last fall, its Green Party members insisted that the relationship with Saudi Arabia conflicted with Sweden’s values, as well as with the image it wants to project abroad. Political commentators on both the left and right asked the obvious question: How did providing arms to a country that subjugates women fit with the bold idea of a “feminist foreign policy?” The day after Wallström was supposed to have appeared in Cairo, on March 10th, the government announced its decision not to renew a bilateral arms agreement with Saudi Arabia. No official explanation followed, but the subtext was clear both in Sweden and to Riyadh (which had likely received some advance notice): Saudi Arabia was no longer viewed as an acceptable buyer of Swedish weapons.","428","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"This was Wallström’s “feminist foreign policy” in practice, and it did not sit well with some of Sweden’s most powerful industrialists, who stood to lose significant income from a break in relations with Saudi Arabia. It seems likely that the government also became concerned about sparking a wider conflict with the Arab world. One week later, a delegation of Swedish officials travelled to Riyadh, carrying letters from Prime Minister Stefan Löfven and King Carl XVI Gustaf, to try to soften relations, explaining that Wallström had not intended to criticize Islam and offering official regrets for any misunderstanding. The Saudi ambassador to Sweden is now set to be reinstated. Wallström’s political opponents came down hard on what they saw as a clumsy performance. Still, the Swedish foreign minister refused to back down, referring only to a misunderstanding, and stressing that no apology for her specific remarks had been, or would be, issued.","429","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"When Wallström announced her feminist foreign policy last fall, she was met with a few smirks and some confusion even within her own diplomatic corps. How would this benefit, rather than just complicate, Sweden’s relations with the rest of the world? Robert Egnell, a visiting professor at the Georgetown Security Studies Program and an advisor to the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace, and Security, explained that, to foreign-policy traditionalists, “a feminist perspective would be idealistic, naïve—and potentially even dangerous—in the realpolitik power struggles between nations.” Within the diplomatic community, where words are carefully chosen so as not to offend, “feminism” is usually avoided, as it risks being perceived as inflammatory and indicative of a stand against men.","430","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"“If the term bothers you, you can call it gender equality,” Wallström told me in a telephone interview in late March, when I asked if it would have been more strategic to choose another word for what she seeks to achieve. “I think feminism is a good term,” she said. “It’s about standing against the systematic and global subordination of women.”","431","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström, who was formerly a European Union commissioner, also served as the first United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. She told me that, in that role, she observed how often crimes against women in conflict are overlooked or ignored, how foreign aid routinely fails to take into account the needs of women and girls, and how seldom women are allowed to participate in peace negotiations. Those experiences stuck with her—as did the often all-male composition of U.N. delegations assigned to solve conflicts. A decade after the U.N. adopted Security Council Resolution 1325, which speaks to the necessity of including women in peace agreements, ninety-seven per cent of military peacekeepers are still men, and less than one in ten participants in peace negotiations are women.","432","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Like Hillary Clinton, who has often argued that “women’s rights are human rights,” Wallström has embraced the concept of “smart power” as articulated by the American political scientist Joseph Nye: that is, when a country invests in solving global-scale problems, such as health and economic development it will benefit that country in the end. For example, as one of the European countries receiving the most Syrian asylum seekers, Sweden would do well to address refugee issues beyond its borders. Women’s rights is another such global issue, and Wallström has found common ground on the topic with some foreign colleagues, from across the political spectrum, such as the U.K.’s First Secretary of State William Hague, from the Conservative party, who, during his tenure as Foreign Secretary, stated that “the full social, economic, and political empowerment of women is the great strategic prize of the twenty-first century.”","433","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström also cites a growing body of research showing that women’s security is directly related to both national and international security. In the 2012 book “Sex and World Peace” a team of four researchers (Valerie M. Hudson, Bonnie Ballif-Spanvill, Mary Caprioli, and Chad F. Emmett) present data indicating that the more violent a state and its citizens are toward women, the more violent that state is likely to be over all, both internally and in its dealings with outside world. “In fact, the very best predictor of a state’s peacefulness is not its level of wealth, its level of democracy, or its ethno-religious identity; the best predictor of a state’s peacefulness is how well its women are treated,” Hudson wrote in a piece for Foreign Policy.","434","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Politicians rarely see women’s rights as having a direct impact on problems of war and peace. But according to this school of thought, a foreign policy that strives to address global gender inequity should in fact be on the agenda of any politician concerned with global security. Particularly at a time when the overwhelmingly male foreign-policy establishment, including international organizations such as the United Nations, appears to have run out of ideas for how to manage or even approach violent conflicts, a more gendered perspective on foreign affairs may in fact be a pragmatic strategy. The authors of “Sex and World Peace” go so far as to suggest that, in the future, “the clash of civilizations” will be based not on ethnic and political differences, but rather on beliefs about gender.","435","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Sweden hardly constitutes a threat to anyone, but Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic show of force against the small Scandinavian country may indicate that it would prefer for Wallström’s ideas not to spread beyond Stockholm. As for other countries, they likely will not want to follow Sweden’s example of angering the world’s largest oil exporter and one of the most important players in the Middle East. But there is an obvious double standard in how Western leaders stress the importance of both human rights and women’s rights but mostly fall silent on these issues as soon as immediate economic interests and political alliances are at stake.","436","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"Wallström plans to continue her experiment of not only championing women’s rights but also putting actual policy behind them, calculating, presumably, that Sweden can afford to do this. Most recently, she has proposed that the E.U. appoint a special representative for women’s issues.","437","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/swedens-feminist-foreign-minister"
"“It’s time to become a little braver in foreign policy,” Wallström told me. “Does anyone seriously mean that Sweden should apologize for what we say about democracy and human rights?

"First up: Jeb Bush. For a couple of months now, journalists have been going along with the fiction that he isn’t yet fully committed to the 2016 Presidential campaign, and is merely in the preparatory stage. In a lengthy story on Politico, Ben White and Marc Caputo reveal the truth: the Bush campaign is already in full flight, but for now it is concentrating on one-per-centers rather than on the electorate at large.","440","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-hillary-money-primary"

"Last week, on his sixty-second birthday, Bush travelled to New York, where Henry Kravis, the private-equity tycoon, threw him a party-cum-fundraiser. Here’s a description of the event, from White and Caputo:","442","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-hillary-money-primary"
"Fund-raising isn’t an incidental part of Bush’s preparations; in fact, it appears to be the main reason he delayed a public announcement that he’s running. Since he’s still not officially a candidate, he isn’t bound by campaign-finance rules governing Presidential campaigns. This means that he can raise large sums of money with fewer restrictions. Speaking in Iowa last week, Joe Biden suggested that 2016 could be the first four-billion-dollar campaign—two billion for each candidate, versus the estimated $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion spent by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, respectively, in 2012. Biden might not be too far off the mark. In any case, Bush has cleverly structured things so that he can raise a boatload of money. Next week, he’s scheduled to attend another lavish fund-raiser, this one in Palm Beach, where he could raise five million dollars. Kenneth Gross, a former attorney for the Federal Election Commission, suggested to White and Caputo that Bush was creating a new template for Presidential campaigns: money first, politics later.","443","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-hillary-money-primary"
"The other news of the day that’s attracting the attention of the political world also relates to fund-raising, and it involves the Clinton Foundation, which Bill Clinton set up in 2001 to promote anti-poverty programs and other philanthropic projects around the world. In today’s Wall Street Journal, James V. Grimaldi and Rebecca Ballhaus revealed that the New York-based charitable foundation has recently received a number of donations from overseas governments, including those of Germany, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Canada’s Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Development Agency, which is responsible for promoting the Keystone XL pipeline.","444","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-hillary-money-primary"
"According to the Journal, the foundation had raised money from foreign governments until 2009, when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. It then stopped the practice, in response to a request from the Obama Administration, which, in the words of Grimaldi and Ballhaus, “was worried about a secretary of state’s husband raising millions while she represented U.S. interests abroad.” Evidently, the foundation’s overseas fund-raising started again after Hillary left the State Department, at the end of 2012, and took a more active role in the Clinton Foundation. (In 2013, it was renamed the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.) The foundation didn’t make any public announcements about the donations from overseas governments, but it does list them on its online donor database, where the two Journal reporters found them.","445","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-hillary-money-primary"
"In a post last week about the Clinton Foundation, which followed the revelation in the Guardian that some of its individual donors had maintained bank accounts at HSBC’s now infamous Geneva branch, I pointed out that it does a lot of good deeds and employs many well-meaning professionals. However, its funding has always raised questions about the motivation of its donors, and about the links between the Clinton family’s charitable and political activities. Just last week, the foundation announced that its principal fund-raiser, Dennis Cheng, was leaving to join Hillary’s campaign, where he is expected to serve as finance director.","446","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-hillary-money-primary"
"Judging by recent stories about infighting among some of Hillary’s fund-raisers, Cheng has work to do in his new post. Inside modern campaigns, people worry about the appearance of their candidate being beholden to powerful interests. But they worry more about raising less cash than their opponents and falling behind in the money primary. As Mitt Romney discovered recently, when his aides started calling potential donors to a prospective Presidential campaign and found that many of them had already committed to Bush, there’s ample reason for concern. In Presidential politics, raising a lot of money doesn’t guarantee success. But the absence of money guarantees failure. ”All that matters in this first quarter is fund-raising,” Scott Reed, the veteran G.O.P. operative who managed Bob Dole’s campaign in 1996, told Politico.* “Nobody else has done what [Bush] has done.”","447","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-hillary-money-primary"

Nor does analyzing whether Chris Christie can become something more than the Factional Favorite of moderate Republicans, or whether Ted Cruz’s impressive early fundraising will make him that rare thing, a Factional Favorite with an outside chance to win.

Jeb Bush’s ruthless approach to locking up the exclusive services of longstanding Republican political consultants and media professionals far ahead of the primaries doesn’t quicken my pulse. Scott Walker’s refusal to affirm Barack Obama’s patriotism doesn’t shock me into a state of alert indignation.

"Since I was eight years old, and the Republican candidates were named Nixon, Rockefeller, and Reagan, and the Democrats were Humphrey, Kennedy, and McCarthy, I’ve been passionate about American politics, as a student, a witness, and a partisan. Politics was in my blood, at the family dinner table, in my work and my free time. But at some point in the past few years it went dead for me, or I for it. Perhaps it was week thirty-eight of the Obama-Romney race (a campaign between “Forward” and “Believe in America”), or the routinization of the filibuster, or the name Priorities USA Action, or the fifty-eighth vote in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act—something happened that made it very hard to continue paying attention. I don’t take this as a sign of personal superiority: I’ve always disliked people who considered themselves to be “above” politics. I mourn my lack of political passion as I would if I were to lose interest in reading fiction, or to stop caring about someone who’d been important to me for most of my life. And I count on getting back the feeling—the intense mix of love, hatred, anxiety, astonishment, and gratification—because life, public life, is impoverished without it. Perhaps it will return sometime before November 8, 2016. But for now—I have to be honest—it’s gone.","455","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/american-politics-why-the-thrill-is-gone"

What has happened is that the same things keep happening. The tidal wave of money keeps happening, the trivialization of coverage keeps happening, the extremism of the Republican Party keeps happening (Ted Cruz: abolish the I.R.S.; Rand Paul: the Common Core is “un-American”). The issues remain huge and urgent: inequality, global warming, immigration, poorly educated children, American decline, radical Islamism.

"John Podesta, the veteran Democratic official, is leaving the White House to join Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign, probably as its chairman. The move was hardly unexpected: Podesta is a Clintonite through and through. He served in Bill Clinton’s White House from start to finish, rising through the ranks to become Chief of Staff, a post he held from October, 1998, to January, 2001. For months now, Podesta has been telling people that if Hillary decided to run he would most likely join her.","January 14, 2015","467","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Now that Podesta has taken the plunge, it almost makes official what we already know: Hillary is in. And so are many longtime residents of Planet Clinton.","468","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"","469","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Even Podesta’s critics concede that he is an effective and experienced operator. Inside the Clinton Administration, he was known as a hard-working, intense figure with a caustic side. In a Times piece from September, 2000, Robert Pear and John Broder wrote, “Colleagues say, half-jesting, that he has an evil twin named Skippy, who is invoked to bring order to an unruly White House.”","470","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"A couple of years after the Clinton Administration ended, Podesta founded the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank that, in a little more than a decade, has become an important player in the Washington power game, providing detailed analysis and policy recommendations, a forum for conversations and debates, and daily commentary on everything from the job figures to Bill Cosby. (Full disclosure: in 2013, I led a panel discussion at the launch of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, which is housed at the Center for American Progress, and for which Podesta once served as chairman.) In January, 2014, Podesta left the Center for American Progress and joined the Obama Administration as a counselor to the President, focussed largely on environmental issues.","471","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"To the delight of environmental activists, when Podesta arrived back at the White House he championed the tactic of using executive power and the edicts of the Environmental Protection Agency to outflank Republican obstructionists on Capitol Hill. Last summer, the E.P.A. proposed a new rule designed to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants by up to thirty per cent. Other federal agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Emergency Management Administration, have also stepped up their environmental initiatives. “I think he”—Podesta—“has made a tremendous difference,” former Vice-President Al Gore told National Journal’s Ben Geman. “I don’t think it, I know it.”","472","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Some conservatives regard Podesta as an environmental extremist. From the left, the rap is that he is too close to major corporations and to Wall Street. In the late nineteen-eighties, when Podesta was working on Capitol Hill, he and his brother, Tony Podesta, founded the lobbying firm the Podesta Group, which is now one of the most successful in Washington. John Podesta hasn’t had a role in the firm for many years. But the Center for American Progress has faced accusations that it does favors for its corporate donors, most specifically in a May, 2013, investigative report by Ken Silverstein for The Nation.","473","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"The Center vigorously denies this charge. In a letter to The Nation, it said, “The inference at the heart of the author’s story is that corporate donations shape or drive the content of CAP and CAP Action. That assertion is baseless and completely false.” In December, 2013, the Center released a list of its corporate benefactors, which included Apple, Google, Walmart, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. The Center also pointed out that more than ninety per cent of its annual budget was financed through donations from individuals and philanthropic foundations, and that corporate donations accounted for less than six per cent.","474","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"My take on this flap is that with the Center for American Progress, as with any other think tank (or newspaper or magazine, for that matter), it is well worth keeping an eye on whether the folks who pay the bills are dictating the message. The Center would enhance its credibility—and this also applies to its competitors—if it more often promoted findings and policies that some of its financial backers and its political allies disagreed with.","475","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"That said, there’s quite a bit to recommend the Center’s activities, particularly its research initiatives and its Web site, which includes the lively (and editorially independent) ThinkProgress blog. Podesta’s efforts in founding the institution and getting it up and running filled a gap in the Washington ecosystem. Other liberal-leaning think tanks, such as the Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, have long done sterling work. But, until the arrival of the Center for American Progress, which is now headed up by Neera Tanden, another Clintonite, no left-leaning think tank had the heft, the resources, and the drive of the conservative Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute. (I am leaving out the Brookings Institution, venerable as it is, because it tends to stay above the fray, and also the New America Foundation, which is smaller and more narrowly focussed.)","476","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"Washington now has a big and well-financed progressive think tank that engages with the political debate on a daily basis. That’s a positive development—and not just for Democrats. On the basis of the theory of countervailing power, it’s good for democracy.","477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"
"As Podesta sets out for 2016, it remains to be seen whether he will be an effective campaign chairman. Until now, most of his experience has been in administration and policy-making, rather than in political campaigning. But whatever services he provides to Hillary, he has already made a big mark on the political topography of the nation’s capital. And that, I’d wager, will be his longest-lasting legacy.","478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/john-podestas-achievements"

"The NBC News anchor Brian Williams is a likable and funny guy, and he is also a serious journalist. He’s said, on David Letterman’s show in 2013, and most recently last week on his newscast, that he was on a helicopter that was forced down after being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, or R.P.G., in Iraq in 2003. (On a number of other occasions, he’s told the story not as specifically, but in equally dramatic fashion.) When I first heard, earlier this week, that this wasn’t quite true, I thought of it as just evidence of a very familiar human foible. Most of us can’t later account for why our egos sometimes get the best of us.","February 5, 2015","481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-mistake"
"Then I watched Williams look into the camera on Wednesday and explain his “mistake” on “NBC Nightly News,” and I thought of Hillary Clinton. In March of 2008, she said that she had come “under sniper fire” in Bosnia a decade earlier. When reporters who had accompanied her said that this was false, ​and CBS offered a video proving it, Clinton said, “I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I’m human.”","482","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-mistake"
"","483","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-mistake"
"So she and Williams are human. We all exaggerate sometimes, but rarely on the public stage. Williams began his statement last night by saying, “On this broadcast last week, in an effort to honor and thank a veteran who protected me and so many others after a ground-fire incident in the desert during the Iraq War invasion, I made a mistake.” He admitted that he soon heard “from some brave men and women in the air crews who were also in that desert.” He admitted that he was “instead in a following craft.” Then he again excused the mistake by wrapping himself in the flag: “This was a bungled attempt by me to thank one special veteran, and by extension our brave military men and women, those who have served, while I did not,” he said. “I hope they know they have my greatest respect, and also now my apology.”","484","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-mistake"
"It sounded like a statement crafted by a P.R. team intent on damage control. It sounded as if it had been composed by the same P.R. team that crafted Mitt Romney’s explanation after video surfaced, during the 2012 election, of Romney telling an audience of Republican donors that forty-seven per cent of Americans are “dependent upon government” and “believe that they are victims.” Romney first tried to calm the fury by saying that his comments were “not elegantly stated,” and that he wanted “to help all Americans.” Later, he said that they were “just completely wrong.”","485","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-mistake"
"Much of the response on Twitter reflects the hysteria endemic to instant commentary: Williams should be fired; Williams should throw away his Emmys. And just after 4 P.M. today, news broke that further complicated the story. In an interview with Jake Tapper, of CNN, the pilot of Williams’s helicopter, Rich Krell, acknowledged that Williams wasn’t completely wrong: their craft had taken fire, but it was from some small arms, not from R.P.G.s. While a helicopter in front had been forced down, theirs had not. Still, Krell said, “we were all scared,” confirming that it had been a harrowing experience.","486","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-mistake"
"Had all his facts been right, however, Williams would not have felt the need to apologize. He has blamed “the fog of memory” for his inaccuracies. Maybe so. I don’t think NBC News is close to contemplating removing Williams from its anchor chair. But anchors require their audience’s trust, as we saw when the former CBS anchor Dan Rather could not rise above third place in the ratings after his reputation was marred by episodes of erratic behavior. Who knows what impact incoming fire will have on Brian Williams’s career. Yet this much is clear: ​journalists are supposed to be more transparent than the politicians we cover. We’re unpopular, in part, because we don’t practice the transparency we preach. Brian Williams believes that journalism is a noble calling, and he has often honored that calling. But by resorting to spin he let down more than “some brave military men and women.”","487","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/brian-williams-mistake"
"The last hope for bringing some rationality to the 2016 Presidential field died Tuesday night when Jon Stewart announced that he would be leaving “The Daily Show.” He didn’t say when—he muttered the names of a few late-2015 months, and something about working out details—but it sounds like it will be before the earliest primary. This is the first good argument that I’ve heard for making the New Hampshire and Iowa contests even earlier. Someone needs to sort out who is clumsy and who is absurd, who is semi-serious and who is wholly alarming; the Republican base isn’t going to do that on its own. And one of those characters—as Stewart might put it, the guy from Jersey, the Dr. Seuss fetishist, the Aqua Buddha ophthalmologist, the little brother of the other guy—has to get the nomination. Stewart, in his Tuesday night announcement, said, “This show doesn’t deserve an even slightly restless host, and neither do you.” What about the poor G.O.P.?

It seems unavoidable now— just as unavoidable as the investigative pieces that will come, laying out questions about her finances and entanglements and those of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Many will be petty, and some, for Democrats, may be painful. Bill Clinton will also be out on the campaign trail. Picture that, even before you picture him back in the White House, but without a proper job. Even last time, with an abbreviated campaign, he said things that got his wife in trouble. He might also do things that have profound comedic and political implications (he has before).

But he is very good at making it clear when we are looking at Citizens United-funded performance art, and when what’s on stage is something, even something quite funny, approximating real politics. He made Elizabeth Warren, whom he had on as a guest many times when she was still a Harvard professor, seem most serious not by being grim himself but by making clear to the audience that the reason he so enjoyed her company was that it was awfully fun listening to someone so smart.

Maybe Comedy Central is talking to HBO, where Oliver is now. One of Stewart’s triumphs has been fostering talent like Oliver. And, of course, Colbert, who recently left Comedy Central, and Larry Wilmore, Jason Jones, Samantha Bee, and Jessica Williams. It won’t be hard for one of them to be funny, but Stewart exhibited a particular genius in bringing them together and deploying them over the political landscape, and conveying that he enjoyed their company. It created a pleasure in politics itself, which is otherwise endangered in this country.","495","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jon-stewart-need-2016"

He made it clear that he has some brittle feelings about the treatment of Brian Williams. Fine—but none of those things, one must concede, are of the sort that have flustered Stewart before. Maybe he really does need a break—couldn’t he squeeze one in the form of some long naps before the election starts, then come back?","496","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jon-stewart-need-2016"

Several years ago, she began to think about another male-dominated part of her life, to which she had previously paid little attention: the portraits on U.S. banknotes. Each of the eleven denominations in circulation, from the one-dollar bill to the ten-thousand-dollar bill, depicts a man. They include eight Presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, William McKinley, Grover Cleveland, and James Madison), two Treasury Secretaries (Alexander Hamilton and Salmon Chase), and the unclassifiable Benjamin Franklin.

In the summer of 2012, she began toying with the idea of trying to get a woman on a banknote, but she didn’t quite know where to start. She e-mailed some friends (“HI SISTERS!” her message began) to ask them which women they would put on bills if it were up to them.","499","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"

"Among the e-mail’s recipients was an old friend of Howard’s, Susan Ades Stone. Ades Stone is a journalist, and she saw the potential for a serious campaign. Together, Howard and Ades Stone decided to mount an organized effort to put a woman on a bill by 2020, the centennial of women’s suffrage. They settled on the twenty-dollar note, not only because of its resonance with the anniversary year but because they thought that Andrew Jackson was the best candidate for removal from U.S. currency. “George Washington and Abe Lincoln and Alexander Hamilton, who invented the Federal Reserve System”—technically, he created a predecessor to the system—“and Ben Franklin—they have a legacy that we’ve been honoring that would make them hard to remove,” Howard said. “But Andrew Jackson?” Jackson had strongly opposed the notion of central banking. Plus, he sought—and signed—the Indian Removal Act, which led to the expulsion of Native Americans from their homes.","501","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Howard and Ades Stone registered their nonprofit, called Women on 20s, and recruited others, including a co-founder of the National Women’s History Project, to join the campaign. Over several months, they built a Web site, and started a Twitter feed and a Facebook page. On Sunday, Women on 20s began inviting people to visit the site and vote for their favorite candidates to replace Jackson on the twenty-dollar bill; the choices include Alice Paul, Betty Friedan, Shirley Chisholm, Sojourner Truth, Rachel Carson, Rosa Parks, Barbara Jordan, Margaret Sanger, Patsy Mink, Clara Barton, Harriet Tubman, Frances Perkins, Susan B. Anthony, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The women were selected from a longer list of a hundred names based on their societal impact and the difficulties they faced in pursuing their goals.","502","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"It wouldn’t require a vote in Congress or Presidential approval to get a woman on the twenty-dollar bill. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for the designs that appear on paper notes, including the portraits. Nor do the people depicted on bills have to meet particularly stringent standards; according to U.S. law, they just have to be dead. Even so, the appearance of U.S. banknotes was hardly modified during the twentieth century; according to historians, this was partly to keep the bills recognizable and partly due to the American public’s resistance to change. “I think the choices of people on those bills, at this point, is more a tradition than it is a matter of consciously choosing these individuals,” Mark Tomasko, an expert on the history of currency, told me. He couldn’t recall any past campaigns to put a woman on a bill. Some Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have tried—and failed—to put Ronald Reagan on the fifty-dollar bill, replacing Ulysses S. Grant.","503","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Ades Stone and Howard are already facing some controversy, and they haven’t even brought their idea to the government yet. It turns out that settling on fifteen finalists, let alone choosing a winner, is easier said than done. The list includes several black women and an Asian-American woman; some people have expressed disappointment that more minority groups aren’t represented. “We would have liked a more diverse list that would have included Native-American women and Latino women, but we weren’t going to just put people in to be representative,” Howard said. “They had to meet the criteria.” Ades Stone added, “We’ve had a few people comment that if we were kicking Andrew Jackson off the bill, he should be replaced by a Native American.”","504","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"
"Howard and Ades Stone hope to present the winning candidate to President Obama some time in the next several months, with the hope that he might help persuade the Treasury Secretary to sign off on a new twenty-dollar-bill design. (A spokesperson for the Treasury Department declined to comment on the campaign.) This might seem like a bit of a circuitous route, but Ades Stone believes that it will make for better P.R. She said, “We could approach the Treasury Secretary, but it’s much more compelling for the public to know that their wishes are being delivered to the President, and, if he wants it done, it’s within his power.” (Ades Stone and Howard have a feeling that Obama might be open to their suggestions, in part because of an offhanded comment he made in a speech last year about a young girl who had written to him asking why there aren’t any women on U.S. currency and offering a list of possible candidates. Obama said at the time that he thought this “was a pretty good idea.”)","505","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-campaign-to-put-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill"

He told me, “2020 seems doable, and Jackson seems like the low-hanging fruit as Presidents on the currency goes, so I think they probably have a shot.” (He also pointed out that, in the nineteenth century, before paper bills became prevalent, most of the money in circulation were coins that did picture a woman: Lady Liberty. There have also been coins featuring Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea, though they haven’t gotten much use.) When I spoke with Howard and Ades Stone on Tuesday, they were still waiting for their campaign to go viral; it had received some press coverage online—Vox and Buzzfeed had written about it—but hadn’t yet gained the traction they were hoping for. Howard brought up a dashboard that tracked how many people had cast votes on the site; the number had reached eight thousand five hundred and fifty-two. I asked how many total votes they had hoped for when they began the campaign; Ades Stone said, “We thought five million.” Howard pointed out that it was early—it hadn’t been seventy hours since the voting had opened.

"Some of those who remained weren’t convinced. When Hannity brought up immigration they booed, prompting Bush to quip, “I’m marking you down as neutral, and I want to be your second choice.” It was a good line, and Bush delivered other zingers too. Asked to respond to the words “Hillary Clinton,” he replied “foreign fund-raising,” a barbed reference to a Washington Post story, published earlier this week, reporting that the Clinton Foundation raised money from overseas governments during Hillary’s tenure as Secretary of State.

As governor of Florida, he reminded his audience, he cut spending, bequeathed his successor a budget surplus, and introduced the first statewide school-voucher system in the country. In a bow to supply-side economics, he said that he believed that tax cuts could create revenue. When the discussion turned to foreign policy, he welcomed Benjamin Netanyahu’s upcoming speech to Congress, saying, “We need to make clear that there is no light between us and Israel.” And then, shifting back to Obama, he accused the President of trampling on the Constitution and disrespecting America’s heritage. It wasn’t exactly Rudy Giuliani questioning Obama’s religion and love of country, but it earned Bush more applause, as Hannity wrapped things up.","515","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-bush-escapes-unscathed-from-the-conservative-den"

"Three Fridays ago at Balthazar, the SoHo brasserie, a large clouded-glass mirror detached from a wall and landed on some people who were having breakfast. One of them was a man—debonair, in a fine scarf and a dark coat—who identified himself to police officers responding to a 911 call as Arnaud Française. He was wheeled out of the restaurant on a gurney and taken to Bellevue. Doctors examined him; he was unharmed. Later, it emerged that he was not M. Française but Arnaud Montebourg, until last August the French Minister of the Economy. One guesses that he tendered the false surname out of embarrassment, not wanting to be known, newly arrived on the East Coast—he was spending the week as the Syngman Rhee 1910 Lecturer at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School—as the guy who went to Balthazar and got crushed by an antique. (Instead, he will have to live down the embarrassment of having christened himself Arnaud Française.)

"Friday’s employment report for January confirmed what has been clear to objective observers since the middle of last year: the American economy is growing strongly, with employers creating jobs at a healthy clip in most major industries. As always, one month’s figures shouldn’t be overemphasized: the payroll number is a volatile data series with a large standard error.

In the past year, job growth has averaged more than two hundred and thirty thousand jobs a month; today there are about 3.2 million more Americans working than there were this time last year.

"Given the lacklustre rates of job growth that we saw in the early stages of recovering from the 2007–09 recession and in the recovery from the dot-com bust of 2000–01, under the Bush Administration, that’s quite an achievement. Employment growth is “astonishingly strong,” Ian Shepherdson, a Wall Street economist, commented.","536","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"

"For Americans looking for work—and with the unemployment rate at 5.7 per cent, there are still nine million of them—it’s obviously a welcome development. It’s also good news for people with jobs. More vacancies means more competition for workers, which should eventually lead to a sustained increase in wages. Indeed, contrary to popular perception, wages are already rising more than prices. Not by much, it is true, but in the year leading up to January, according to the Labor Department, average hourly earnings in outside the farm sector rose by 2.2 per cent.

"History (and James Carville) teaches us that it is likely to be a big one. If healthy employment growth continues throughout this year—which is a big if, to be sure—the G.O.P. will be robbed of one of the most potent arguments any political party challenging for power can have: that the incumbents have screwed up the economy. Should trends continue, 2016 could end up looking more like 1988, when George H. W. Bush scored a third successive victory for the Republicans, or 2000, when the Democrats, under Al Gore, won the popular vote for the third time in row. And it would look a lot less like 2008, when John McCain, burdened by a recession, failed to pull off a party three-peat.","541","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"To oversimplify things a bit, Bush, Sr., and Gore both promised voters more of the same, but with a different face in the White House. In 2008, with the economy in recession, McCain didn’t have the option of running on his predecessor’s domestic legacy, and he had great difficulty articulating a coherent alternative. Of course, many other factors affected the race, including George W. Bush’s disastrous war in Iraq and McCain’s shortcomings as a candidate, but the comatose economy was a big burden on the Republicans, just as it would be on the Democrats in 2016 if job growth were still lagging.","542","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"A buoyant economy changes the whole environment. If Hillary Clinton (assuming she gets the Democratic nomination) can wholeheartedly embrace President Obama’s domestic record rather than have to equivocate and point out what, if anything, she would have done differently, her task will be much easier. The Democrats aren’t there yet, but things are going in the right direction for them, and the improved economic situation is already having an impact on public opinion.","543","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"During the past few months, there has been a notable uptick in Presidential Obama’s approval rating.

One or two individual polls have seen the President hit fifty per cent. If the economic news stays positive, the upward move will almost certainly continue. “Americans’ ratings of Obama appear to be catching up with their improved economic views,” Gallup’s Lydia Saad noted.","544","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/strong-job-figures-leave-republicans-pickle"
"The economic argument shouldn’t be pushed too far, however. In 1988, Bush, Sr., was facing an uninspiring opponent in Michael Dukakis. In 2000, Gore, for all his success in winning the popular vote, still lost the election (with the assistance of the Supreme Court). Plus, the electoral environment is changing. A new update from Gallup shows that Americans are more polarized than ever where the Presidency is concerned. The gap in Obama’s approval rating among Republicans and Democrats has averaged seventy per cent, higher than George W. Bush’s average of sixty-one per cent, Clinton’s fifty-six, and Reagan’s fifty-two.

"Michelle Obama went to offer condolences on the death of King Abdullah—it involved, as such events often do, an unplanned trip, with a detour from India, but the First Lady came up with an appropriate outfit. She wore loose black pants, a loose, high-cut blue shirt, and a loose printed manteau. Below her neck, only her hands were uncovered, and she was game about not offering them when the Saudi men on the reception line ignored her, or nodded vaguely. She didn’t wear a head scarf; she probably could have picked one up in India, but, really, why should she have? Saudi women must cover their heads, and often cover their faces, too; foreign women in Saudi Arabia, though, aren’t required to do so, and when Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton visited their heads were bare. In 2010, Michelle was photographed wearing a head scarf in Indonesia—those pictures were widely recirculated after King Abdullah’s funeral—but that was for a visit to a mosque. At other events in Indonesia, she didn’t bother.","January 28, 2015","550","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/michelle-obama-doesnt-owe-anyone-head-scarf"

"Michelle Obama is an American woman, and can choose to forgo a head scarf (or to wear one). The Saudis know that; the First Lady was not a member of a landing party greeting an uncontacted culture. King Abdullah’s family includes polygamists and partiers who travel extensively, and are unlikely to have been abashed even if Michelle Obama wore a knee-length dress. One almost wishes that the First Lady’s clothing was quite the groundbreaking, grand gesture that some commentaries portrayed it as being—an “uproar,” causing “outrage,” or a “bold political statement”—but, the BBC noted, it does not seem to have made much of a stir in the kingdom, after all. (Some people tweeted about immodesty; some people always do.) Instead, the “offense” they generally seem to worry about is women in their country claiming their rights, or even insisting on power. Women in Saudi Arabia likely know too well that their rulers’ interests lie not in controlling Michelle Obama’s hair but in controlling them. This includes their assets, under the kingdom’s “guardianship” system, and their ability to make medical and educational choices, or even to drive a car. Many of them have campaigned openly for those rights, at risk to themselves, and one benefit of what is otherwise a silly controversy might be to remind Saudi women of the structure of their lives. (The videos women have made of themselves driving through Riyadh reveal more than any funeral pictures.) Neither the injustice nor what American women are wearing in Washington will be news to them. The princes, to avoid accountability for their own corruption, have accommodated Wahhabi extremists who might indeed be bothered by the idea of any woman, anywhere, appearing with her head uncovered. That is really not Michelle Obama’s problem. She doesn’t have to dress to please Al Qaeda. If she had worn a head scarf, her American critics would undoubtedly have attacked her for doing just that.","552","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/michelle-obama-doesnt-owe-anyone-head-scarf"
"But it’s worth imagining another scenario: suppose, for reasons independent of politics, that Michelle Obama liked the way a head scarf looked. Why shouldn’t she put one on? There are, naturally, some constraints on what any First Lady wears on public occasions; jeans and sneakers at the Inauguration would be strange. But if we, at some point in this century, have a First Lady, or President, who wears any sort of headgear, for reasons related to any number of faiths (theology and millinery have historically enjoyed close alliances), what, exactly, would be the problem with that? It is right to be outraged at religious police chasing Saudi women and arresting them for supposedly immodest dress. It is also right to ask why French laws should prevent a woman in Paris from covering her face or a schoolgirl from wearing a head scarf.","553","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/michelle-obama-doesnt-owe-anyone-head-scarf"
"In any place or time, there are ways to adapt, to be polite and make gestures, without feeling that one has been put in someone else’s costume. That is part of fashion, and of the pleasure in dressing well, which is distinct from the fear of dressing badly. Michelle Obama did that with her loose pants and long jacket, and it was enough. A couple of the press reports about her trip noted, as the Telegraph put it, that Queen Elizabeth “wore a head scarf on her visit to the Gulf in 1979.” That statement deserves a few footnotes (and not just because Queen Elizabeth, a truck driver during the war, personally took the wheel to chauffeur then Prince Abdullah on a headlong spin around Balmoral in 1998, to the point where he pleaded with her to slow down). The 1979 photos of the Queen getting off the plane in Saudi Arabia show her in a sort of electric-blue pantsuit and a modified turban, a look that says as much about the seventies as it does about Saudi Arabia. On the same trip, when the Queen went to the racetrack in Riyadh—Her Majesty likes that sort of thing—she wore a small orange half-hat. And, for more formal events with the Saudi royals, in the days that followed, there was no hat or head scarf at all. She wore her crown.","554","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/michelle-obama-doesnt-owe-anyone-head-scarf"

For months now, the seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator has been indicating he would run for President. The official announcement, which came in the form of an e-mail to his supporters, merely confirmed that he’ll contest the Democratic primary rather than run as an independent. (Although he caucuses with the Senate Democrats, Sanders was elected in 2006 and 2012 as an “independent socialist.”)","April 30, 2015","556","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"

"The contrast with the carefully orchestrated launches of the Clinton, Cruz, and Rubio campaigns, to name but three, wasn’t due to the fact that Sanders hasn’t got any money—he has almost five million dollars left over from his last Senate campaign. Sanders was sending the message that he isn’t so much a candidate as an anti-candidate. Even more than Howard Dean’s pitch, in 2004, Sanders’s will be based on the proposition that American politics are broken and corrupted to their core, and that only an insurgency can do anything about it. “Let’s be clear,” Sanders said in his e-mail. “This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It’s about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: ‘Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.’ ”","558","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"That last line is one Sanders uses a lot, and it cuts across party lines. Mainly, he uses it to lambaste post-Citizens United Republicans, with their motley assortment of right-wing sugar daddies, from the Koch brothers to Sheldon Adelson to Harold Simmons. But Sanders has also accused the Democratic Party of playing the money game and pandering to wealthy donors. Last November, for example, he said that Party leaders had failed to make clear “that they are prepared to stand with the working-class people of this country, take on the big-money interests.” Now that he’s running in the Democratic primary, we can expect to hear him repeat this argument and apply it to the establishment candidate, Hillary Clinton. Indeed, he’s already doing this.","559","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Asked by Jonathan Karl, of ABC News, what he thought about the controversy over donations from wealthy foreign interests to the Clinton Foundation, Sanders replied, “It tells me what is a very serious problem. It’s not just about Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton. It is about a political system today that is dominated by big money. It’s about the Koch brothers being prepared to spend nine hundred million dollars in the coming election. … We’re looking at a system where our democracy is being owned by a handful of billionaires.”","560","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Sanders isn’t an attack dog. He likes to boast that he has never run a negative ad, and, rather than personalizing things, he generally sticks to the issues. Asked at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday why he was a better candidate than Clinton, he dodged the question. But the Clinton Foundation isn’t the only area where, in the past few days, he has raised questions about Clinton’s record. During an interview on CNN, he said that she ought to say whether she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal that the Obama Administration is trying to complete. And, in an interview with the Associated Press, Sanders reminded people that Clinton voted for the Iraq War and he voted against it.","561","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Despite these pointed statements, the conventional wisdom in political circles is that Sanders’s entry into the race is good news for Team Brooklyn. He can’t win the primary, the argument goes, and he will occupy the space to the left of Clinton, thus denying it to more plausible candidates, such as Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland. That may be true. But if Sanders succeeds in building a vigorous grassroots campaign, as Dean did in 2004, he could still have a significant impact on the contest.","562","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"Admittedly, that’s a big if. For much of his career, Sanders has been a loner rather than a team player. His social-media presence is respectable but not huge. (His Facebook page has just under a million “likes”; on Twitter, he has close to three hundred thousand followers. ) Until he shows that he can attract big crowds and raise money from small donors, other players on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, such as labor unions and environmental groups, will remain wary of endorsing him.","563","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"
"But, for all the challenges Sanders faces, his presence in the Democratic primary field is surely a plus. As I pointed out a few months ago, when he released his Economic Agenda for America, he’s a genuine economic populist, and many of his policy proposals—such as spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure investment, introducing a carbon tax, and replacing private health insurance with Medicare for all—are eminently defensible, if politically unrealistic. Most of all, he will provide a voice to those Democrats who agree with him that the U.S. political system has been bought, lock, stock, and barrel. In the televised debates and elsewhere, he will demand that the other candidates, Clinton included, respond to this indictment and say what they intend to do about it.","564","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/welcome-to-the-2016-race-bernie-sanders"

"Earlier today, the Islamic State posted a twenty-two-minute video online that shows a young Jordanian pilot, Moaz al-Kasasbeh, being burned alive in a cage. Kasasbeh’s F-16 went down over northern Syria on December 24th, and he was the first member of the U.S.-led coalition to be captured by ISIS. Over the past week, Jordan attempted to obtain his release by offering to exchange a woman on death row whose suicide vest had failed to explode at a wedding in 2005.

"The United States has arguably never had a viable hostage policy. In the Republic’s earliest days, after Barbary pirates seized American sailors off merchant ships Congress willingly paid for their release. In the late eighteenth century, the American government gave the Dey of Algiers almost a million dollars—roughly a sixth of the annual U.S. budget at the time—and a thirty-six-gun frigate to win the freedom of more than a hundred sailors seized off a dozen American ships. Some had been held for years.","573","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/illusion-hostage-policy"

"The United States has often strayed from its own policy as well. The Carter Administration brokered a financial arrangement with Tehran—allowing international adjudication of Iranian assets frozen by Washington—in exchange for release of Americans.

In 2009, three young Americans working in Iraqi Kurdistan were detained by an Iranian border patrol as they hiked along the border. One of them, Sarah Shourd, was held for fourteen months before she was released, on medical grounds, after the government of Oman reportedly assumed her half-million-dollar “bail.” The other two, Shane Bauer and Joshua Fattal, were tried for espionage and sentenced to eight years.

The former Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson, who was held hostage by Hezbollah in Beirut for seven years, often chained to a radiator, is firmly opposed to paying off the captors. “All you’re doing is creating a market for hostages,” he told me on Monday. “On the other hand, the U.S. has refused to talk with anybody—not even negotiate—since Reagan got his fingers burned,” Anderson said, referring to the Iran-Contra scandal of the nineteen-eighties. “That’s not a valid policy either. That’s just sticking your head in the sand and hoping the problem goes away. That’s very hard on the families.

Hostages taken today may nominally be victims of a single group, but they are caught up more fundamentally in a dysfunctional region-wide configuration. To end the broader problem will require brokering among leaders from Lebanon to Pakistan about the future of the region, both politically and physically.","583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/illusion-hostage-policy"

"Early last year, General Khalifa Haftar left his home in northern Virginia—where he had spent most of the previous two decades, at least some of that time working with the Central Intelligence Agency—and returned to Tripoli to fight his latest war for control of Libya. Haftar, who is a mild-looking man in his early seventies, has fought with and against nearly every significant faction in the country’s conflicts, leading to a reputation for unrivalled military experience and for a highly flexible sense of personal allegiance. In the Green Mountains, the country’s traditional hideout for rebels and insurgents, he established a military headquarters, inside an old airbase surrounded by red-earth farmland and groves of hazelnut and olive trees. Haftar’s force, which he calls the Libyan National Army, has taken much of the eastern half of the country, in an offensive known as Operation Dignity. Most of the remainder, including the capital city of Tripoli, is held by Libya Dawn, a loose coalition of militias, many of them working in a tactical alliance with Islamist extremists. Much as General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has boasted of doing in Egypt, General Haftar proposes to destroy the Islamist forces and bring peace and stability—enforced by his own army.","585","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"When I visited Haftar’s base, earlier this winter, I passed a Russian-made helicopter gunship and was greeted by a group of fighters unloading ammo. The base was in a state of constant alert. Haftar is a top-priority assassination target for Libya Dawn’s militias. Last June, a suicide bomber exploded a Jeep outside his home near Benghazi, killing four guards but missing the primary target. Now there is heavy security around Haftar at all times. At his base, soldiers frisk visitors and confiscate weapons. A few months ago, someone reportedly attempted to kill him with an explosive device concealed in a phone, and so his men collect phones, too.","586","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Haftar greeted me in a spotless office with a set of beige sofas and a matching carpet. Wearing an old-fashioned regimental mustache and a crisp khaki uniform, he looks more like a retired schoolteacher than like the American-backed tyrant his enemies describe. In a deliberate voice, he told me why he had gone back to war. After participating in the 2011 uprising against Muammar Qaddafi, he tried to find a place for himself in Libya’s new politics. When he didn’t succeed, he said, he went home to Virginia for a time, “to enjoy my grandchildren.” All the while, he watched as Libya floundered under a succession of weak governments, and the country’s militias grew more powerful. Last summer, Islamist extremists moved to seize Benghazi; in a merciless campaign aimed at the remains of civil society, assassins killed some two hundred and seventy lawyers, judges, activists, military officers, and policemen—including some of Haftar’s old friends and military colleagues. “There was no justice and no protection,” he said. “People no longer left their houses at night. All of this upset me greatly. We had no sooner left behind Qaddafi’s rule than we had this?”","587","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Haftar reached out to contacts in what remained of Libya’s armed forces, in civil society, in tribal groups, and, finally, in Tripoli. “Everyone told me the same thing,” he said. “ ‘We are looking for a savior. Where are you?’ I told them, ‘If I have the approval of the people, I will act.’ After popular demonstrations took place all over Libya asking me to step in, I knew I was being pushed toward death, but I willingly accepted.”","588","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Like many self-appointed saviors, Haftar spoke with a certain self-admiring fatalism. But his history is much more complex than he cares to acknowledge. As an Army cadet in 1969, he participated in Qaddafi’s coup against the Libyan monarchy, and eventually became one of his top officers. “He was my son,” Qaddafi once told an interviewer, “and I was like his spiritual father.”","589","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"In 1987, as Libya fought with Chad over a strategic strip of borderland, Qaddafi chose Haftar as his commanding officer. Haftar’s base was soon overrun in a Chadian attack—part of a conflict that became known as the Toyota War, for the Land Cruisers that Chad’s troops drove into battle. The Chadians killed thousands of Libyan troops, and took Haftar and four hundred of his men prisoner. When Qaddafi publicly disavowed the P.O.W.s, Haftar was enraged, and called for his men to join him in a coup. By 1988, he had aligned himself with the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, a Chad-based opposition group supported by the C.I.A. Soon afterward, he was released from prison.","590","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Haftar’s work in Chad did not bring him glory. His enemies like to recall that Chad’s government accused the Libyan forces of employing napalm and poison gas during the war. Afterward, two of Haftar’s fellow-prisoners reported that those who refused to join his coup were left behind in their jail cells. As military commander of the Salvation Front, he plotted an invasion of Libya—but Qaddafi outflanked him, backing a disruptive coup in Chad. The C.I.A. had to airlift Haftar and three hundred and fifty of his men to Zaire and, eventually, to the United States. Haftar was given citizenship, and remained in the U.S. for the next twenty years.","591","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"For a time, Haftar stayed involved with the C.I.A., and with the Salvation Front’s abortive efforts to topple Qaddafi, including a plot in which a number of Haftar’s fellow-conspirators were captured and executed. According to Ashur Shamis, a former leader of the Salvation Front, Haftar lived well in Virginia, though no one knew how he made his money. But he did not return to Libya, fearing that he would be executed.","592","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"After the U.S. invaded Iraq, in 2003, Qaddafi, who had been among America’s most vitriolic enemies, suddenly agreed to give up his nuclear-weapons program and attempt a rapprochement. By then, the C.I.A. had evidently loosened its ties with Haftar, and, when he returned to Libya, in March, 2011, he was on his own. Nevertheless, Haftar’s enemies accuse him of being a C.I.A. plant, a traitor, and a vicious killer, and of seeking to install himself as a latter-day Qaddafi.","593","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"There is no overstating the chaos of post-Qaddafi Libya. Two competing governments claim legitimacy. Armed militias roam the streets. The electricity is frequently out of service, and most business is at a standstill; revenues from oil, the country’s greatest asset, have dwindled by more than ninety per cent. Some three thousand people have been killed by fighting in the past year, and nearly a third of the country’s population has fled across the border to Tunisia. What has followed the downfall of a tyrant—a downfall encouraged by NATO air strikes—is the tyranny of a dangerous and pervasive instability.","594","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"For Haftar, the east was the obvious place to begin his offensive. “Benghazi was the main stronghold of terrorism in Libya, so we started there,” he said. An old Libyan maxim holds that everything of importance happens in Benghazi. In 1937, Benito Mussolini came there to solidify his colonial power. In 1951, the newly crowned King Idris I broadcast a radio address from the city to proclaim Libya independent. When Qaddafi launched his military coup against the monarchy, he was a young officer based in Benghazi. In February, 2011, the uprising against his rule erupted there, and the following month the West intervened there to prevent him from massacring the city’s revolutionaries and its civilian population.","595","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"The intervention that helped decide the Libyan conflict began tentatively. As Qaddafi moved harshly to put down the rebellion, vowing to “cleanse Libya house by house,” President Obama was reluctant to get involved, and his aides argued about the wisdom of forcing Qaddafi from power. But America’s allies in Europe, particularly the British and the French, were already convinced. In March, 2011, the well-connected French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy arrived in the city and took it upon himself to make sure that the rebels got aid. In Paris recently, I asked Lévy why he’d adopted the Libyan cause. “Why? I don’t know!” he said. “Of course, it was human rights, for a massacre to be prevented, and blah blah blah—but I also wanted them to see a Jew defending the liberators against a dictatorship, to show fraternity. I wanted the Muslims to see that a Frenchman—a Westerner and a Jew—could be on their side.”","596","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Lévy said that he returned to Paris and told President Nicolas Sarkozy that humanitarian intervention wasn’t enough. “The real objective had to be to topple Qaddafi,” he told me. Sarkozy agreed, and Lévy became his emissary. Lévy accompanied a Libyan opposition leader to meet Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to lobby for U.S. involvement.* “It was hard to convince the Americans,” he said. “Robert Gates was totally opposed. Obama as usual was hesitating. But Hillary got it.”","597","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Late that month, as Qaddafi dispatched a convoy to attack the rebels in Benghazi, French warplanes began bombing. The U.K. and the U.S. followed, in an arm’s-length operation that the Obama Administration described as “leading from behind.” From warships in the Mediterranean, they launched a withering strike of a hundred and twelve Tomahawk missiles, but within days Gates had announced that the French and the British would take the lead. The coalition kept fighting for seven months, with American forces in a lower-profile role. In the end, Lévy was pleased with the intervention. “The NATO mission, as far as I am concerned, was as it had to be.”","598","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"On September 11, 2012, the country’s history again turned in Benghazi: a mob of extremists set fire to the U.S. consular compound and attacked a nearby annex, killing the Ambassador, Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans. In the United States, a rancorous debate began about the circumstances of Stevens’s death, with Obama’s opponents in Congress assailing him for the lack of security at the compound and accusing him of a coverup. The U.S. wound down its diplomatic presence and essentially abandoned its role in the international efforts to rebuild Libya and foster democracy.","599","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"“The killing of Chris Stevens had the effect of helping the terrorists acquire greater power,” a senior Administration official told me. “The bad guys were trying to get the West out, and they succeeded. Because of the politicization of that episode in the U.S., the government paused to make sure no one else got hurt, and reduced our geographic scope and presence in the country.” A senior government official said that Stevens’s death had brought a “broader chill” in efforts to influence events in Libya. “We had a pilot training program, for instance,” he said. “Suddenly, we were being accused of supporting terrorism.” For Lévy, the West’s abandonment of Libya was a dismaying moral failure. “Having done what we have done—France, the U.K., and the U.S.—we have a duty to Libya,” he said. “It would be a disaster if Libya does not rebuild itself.”","600","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"In a sense, Libya’s unravelling began even as the country achieved its “liberation.” On October 20, 2011, after nine months of fighting, a group of thuwar—battle-hardened militiamen—from the port city of Misrata found Qaddafi hiding in a drainage pipe and killed him on the spot. Afterward, his mutilated body was taken to a cold-storage room and left there for several days as thousands of people came to view it and take pictures. Another group of Misratan militiamen massacred sixty-six of Qaddafi’s last loyalists in the garden of a Sirte hotel, after they videotaped themselves tormenting their captives.","601","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"It had been clear from the start that the militias were going to be a deeply troublesome feature of post-Qaddafi Libya. The rebel alliance was hastily thrown together from many disparate groups—some friendly to Western ideals and others driven by Islamist dreams of a new caliphate. Even as Western governments deliberated over whether to support the rebels, jihadists from the eastern city of Derna emerged as a force on the battlefield. In an ugly episode in July, 2011, the rebel coalition’s military commander, General Abdel Fattah Younes, was abducted and murdered, likely by Islamists seeking revenge for Younes’s persecution of them when he was Qaddafi’s interior minister.","602","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"As Qaddafi fled Tripoli, in late August, the city was swarmed by two militia forces: one from the western city of Zintan and the other from Misrata. The two groups had been allied in the effort to oust Qaddafi, but as they raced to occupy key positions in Tripoli a rivalry began. The militias ransacked Qaddafi’s well-stocked armories, and the Misratans made off with hundreds of Russian-made tanks. The Zintanis took over the international airport. Several other armed Islamist groups also seized positions for themselves.","603","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"The profusion of young men with guns alarmed Rory Stewart, a British M.P. who had come to Libya to gather information for Parliament. I was in Libya at the time, and Stewart joined me for a couple of days in Tripoli; after one confrontation with armed men at a roadblock, he asked, “What I want to know is, who is going to disarm these militias?” More important, he wondered, who was going to put Libya back together again, and create jobs for all the armed young men?","604","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Stewart returned in March of 2012, and noted that NATO was doing little to help. “There was a single British policeman assigned to the Ministry of the Interior—and that was the U.K.’s disarmament-and-demobilization program!” he said. “There were those in the Libyan parliament who were asking, ‘Where’s the post-intervention plan?,’ but my own instinct at the time was that we’d been burned very badly by nation-building in Iraq.” The Western powers seemed to be placing their hopes in a less committed program. Stewart told me, “You get a U.N. resolution for humanitarian intervention, you get rid of Qaddafi, you don’t put boots on the ground, you get regional players like Turkey and Qatar to sign generous checks, and you step back. You imagine that it’ll be tricky, but no one could imagine it would be this bad.”","605","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"As the country tried to rebuild itself, there were some reasons for hope. In July, 2012, Libyans voted for the first time in six decades, electing a national assembly called the General National Congress. A loose consortium of liberal and centrist parties outpolled candidates affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, which had surged after Qaddafi was deposed; the new Prime Minister, Ali Zeidan, was a human-rights lawyer. But the elections did little to diminish the influence of the militias. Indeed, Libya’s tens of thousands of thuwar became increasingly powerful: rather than finding the fighters jobs and forcing them to disarm, the government put them on the state payroll. Frederic Wehrey, a Libya analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me, “Probably only about a third of the militiamen actually fought in the war. The problem is that when the government started funding them it created more and more of them. No records were ever kept, so people were double- and triple-dipping.” Westerners started to come under attack with troubling frequency. In January, 2013, gunmen in Benghazi fired on an Italian diplomat’s car, but he emerged unharmed. In April, a car bomb, claimed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, severely damaged the French Embassy in Tripoli.","606","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Although the Islamists had lost at the polls, they found a way to assert political power. In May, they urged the G.N.C. to pass a law banning virtually everyone who had participated in Qaddafi’s government from holding public office. During the vote, armed militiamen stormed government ministries to demand the law’s passage. The immediate effect was to neutralize several of the Islamists’ key rivals, mostly political moderates and technocrats who had served at the end of Qaddafi’s reign. The speaker of the G.N.C. was obliged to resign. In December, 2013, the G.N.C. endorsed Sharia law as the source of all legislation and voted to extend its mandate for an additional year.","607","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Haftar watched the country’s decline with growing anger. On February 14th, he appeared on television to announce the unilateral dissolution of parliament and the creation of a “Presidential committee” and cabinet, which would govern until new elections could be held. His move had the hallmarks of a coup, yet Haftar had no apparent way to enforce it, and he was publicly taunted for his hubris. Prime Minister Zeidan called the attempt “ridiculous.” But Haftar had a strategy. He had embarked on a series of “town hall” meetings around the country, while he secretly built an army, with the support of old comrades from the military. In May, he launched Operation Dignity, with attacks against Islamist militias in Benghazi, which he said were intended to “eliminate extremist terrorist groups” in Libya. Not long afterward, his forces occupied the parliament building in Tripoli.","608","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Haftar’s offensive resonated with many Libyans, who had grown frustrated with the G.N.C. and the violence that had flourished during its rule. At around the same time, the G.N.C. agreed to convene a new legislative body, the House of Representatives. The Islamists performed poorly in the elections, in June, but, before the new parliament could take office, the Islamists, strengthened by militiamen from Misrata, attacked Tripoli’s international airport, in an attempt to seize it from Haftar. The airport, including one and a half billion dollars’ worth of aircraft, was destroyed, and about a hundred fighters were killed. With Tripoli a battlefield, the U.S. pulled out of Libya entirely, moving its Embassy to Malta, separated from the besieged capital by two hundred miles of water.","609","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Libyans gradually learned to navigate the violence. A young Tripoli businessman who asked to be called Mohamed told me of getting a call last July, telling him that two militias were fighting on the road to the airport. “The morning it started, my partner tried to drive to our office and got turned back,” he said. Mohamed headed to the office anyway; their employees’ payroll money was held in a safe there, and he wanted to retrieve it before it was destroyed or looted. “There were literally bullets flying right overhead,” he said. He managed to get the money and leave the city, negotiating the militia roadblocks using a credential that a highly placed friend had given him. “All along the airport road, there were no-go zones, with separate battles going on, and both sides ransacking people’s houses.”","610","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"With the fighting in Tripoli, two opposing armies took shape. The group aligned against Haftar, Libya Dawn, is an uneasy coalition; it includes former Al Qaeda jihadists who fought against Qaddafi in the nineties, Berber ethnic militias, members of Libya’s branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, and a network of conservative merchants from Misrata, whose fighters make up the largest block of Libya Dawn’s forces. Haftar’s army is composed mainly of Qaddafi-era soldiers and federalists seeking greater autonomy for the eastern region of Cyrenaica, mixed with tribal fighters from the west and the south.","611","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Last August, Libya Dawn took control of Tripoli, effectively dividing the country into east and west. The Islamists who had lost power in the newly created House of Representatives insisted that the G.N.C. was the country’s only legitimate government. With the country increasingly unstable, the H.O.R. established itself in the city of Tobruk, eight hundred miles to the east. There the members proclaimed themselves Libya’s “true government”—even as they retreated for a time to a Greek car ferry moored offshore. The U.N. and most of the international community recognize the H.O.R., but Libya’s Supreme Court ruled that the G.N.C. was the national legislature.

"As the standoff worsens, regional powers have stepped in. Haftar’s army reportedly receives weapons and financing from Egypt, led by the vehemently anti-Islamist General Sisi; from Saudi Arabia; and from the United Arab Emirates. (The Emiratis and the Egyptians have gone so far as to covertly bomb targets on Haftar’s behalf, eliciting an unusual public rebuke by the U.S. government.) Libya Dawn is backed by Qatar and Turkey, which support the Muslim Brotherhood. Their involvement has given the conflict the dimensions of a proxy war.","613","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"The regional implications of Libya’s breakdown are vast. The southern desert offers unguarded crossings into Algeria, Niger, Chad, and Sudan, where armed bands—including human traffickers and jihadists from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb—roam freely in four-wheel-drive convoys. Huge numbers of migrants, mostly Africans but also some Middle Easterners, are being smuggled through Libya. At the Mediterranean coast, they are placed in overcrowded boats and pointed toward Italy, where the fortunate ones are picked up by the coast guard or by passing cargo ships. Last year, the number of migrants reaching Italy in this fashion rose to a hundred and seventy thousand; more than three thousand are believed to have drowned at sea. In early February, another three hundred died.","614","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Libya has long been an isolated and constricted place, and the revolution has done little to change that. Since July, Tripoli’s only functioning airport has been Mitiga, a former U.S. airbase that Qaddafi took over in 1970. Then Haftar’s bombers struck Mitiga, and for a time there were no flights there, either.","615","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Many of the young Libyans I met during the revolution are now in Tunisia, Egypt, Bulgaria, London—anywhere but Libya. The exiles who came back to build a new country have largely left. The people who have remained are those who can’t get out, and they mostly stay close to home. In any case, there’s little to do. Many shops are closed during the day, opening for a few hours after evening prayers; there are no women to be seen on the streets. There are sporadic bursts of gunfire and explosions, and it is impossible to tell whether someone is being shot or someone is cleaning a gun on a rooftop. Nobody asks; Libyans have become inured to war, and, in any case, decades of secret-police surveillance have conditioned them not to inquire into the causes of violence.","616","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Despite Qaddafi’s taste for grandiose gestures, modern Libya has never valued aesthetic beauty. New homes are built out of cement block and left unpainted; trash is dumped in the streets. The revolutionaries bulldozed Qaddafi’s palace and smashed many icons of his regime, and extremists are despoiling the rest. In Tripoli, there was a statue of a bare-breasted woman nuzzling a gazelle; extremists blew a hole through her belly and hauled the statue away. At the Greco-Roman ruins of Cyrene, almost all the statues of gods have been disfigured. Under a line of vandalized bas-reliefs, I saw a spray-painted message in Arabic script: “Destroy the stone idols, no to restoration.”","617","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"The Muslim Brotherhood and the Misratan leaders have spoken out against jihadist atrocities, but a significant and growing extremist element remains active on the battlefield. In Benghazi, where Haftar’s soldiers have been fighting Islamist groups for control, the combat has caused widespread destruction and a steady stream of casualties. Haftar claims to hold most of the city, though he says that snipers have slowed his advance. The main enemy is Ansar al-Sharia, the group implicated in Stevens’s death and widely suspected of leading the assassination campaign that devastated civil society in Benghazi. In late January, Mohamed al-Zahawi, the leader of Ansar, died from wounds suffered in battle, but his forces have kept fighting.","618","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"After Qaddafi’s overthrow, hundreds of fighters from Derna, a city long associated with Islamist extremism, travelled to Syria to join the war against President Bashar al-Assad. Many fought alongside Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda, and some joined ISIS. In recent months, a sizable number have reportedly returned home in order to fight against Haftar’s forces. In October, a Derna-based jihadist group declared its allegiance to ISIS, and, a few months later, another ISIS unit claimed responsibility for the execution of a dozen Libyan soldiers. In an audacious daylight assault in late January, a third group of ISIS gunmen raided the Corinthia, a five-star hotel in downtown Tripoli, killing at least eight people. A few weeks later, ISIS took over a village near the coastal town of Bin Jawad.","619","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Haftar says that he intends to take on Derna’s extremists once he has conquered Benghazi. “We will use all the means at our disposal to exterminate them,” he assured me. Haftar possesses a small air force—an advantage he holds over Libya Dawn, which has only one or two aircraft—and every few days his fleet of vintage MIGs carries out bombing sorties over Benghazi, or, farther afield, in Ajdabiya, Misrata, Sirte, and Tripoli.","620","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"

"In Washington, Haftar’s absolutist tactics have caused discomfort. The senior Administration official told me emphatically, “The U.S. government has nothing to do with General Khalifa Haftar. Haftar is killing people, and he says he is targeting terrorists, but his definition is way too broad. Haftar is a vigilante. And the predictable result of his vigilantism is to unite the others”—giving common cause to extremists and non-extremists within Libya Dawn. “It is almost as if one part of Libya were controlled by White Russians—that’s Haftar—and another part were controlled by Bolsheviks.”","624","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Benjamin Rhodes, the deputy national-security adviser and a close confidant of Obama’s, acknowledged that Libya’s situation was grim. “Getting the technocrats and the guys with the guns on the same page has been very difficult,” he said. “The first task is to get them in conversation where they can receive help from us. We’re doing this through a U.N. initiative, plus some quiet diplomacy behind the scenes.” He noted that there has also been occasional military action. Last June, Delta Force operatives abducted Ahmed Abu Khattala, an Ansar member who is suspected of leading the attack that killed Ambassador Stevens. Khattala is now awaiting trial in the U.S. “The trick is for us to help people get back to the point where the Libyans can achieve what their revolution was about in the first place,” Rhodes said. “But it’s probably not going to happen on Washington’s timeline.”","625","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Rhodes was one of the aides who, along with Clinton, Susan Rice, and Samantha Power, helped persuade Obama to join the intervention. In spite of the chaos that followed, he stands by that decision. “We saved a lot of lives in Benghazi and the rest of the country,” he said. “If Qaddafi had gone into Benghazi, I think Libya would look more like Syria today.” He added, “What did we do wrong? Even the President would acknowledge that it’s been extremely difficult to fill the vacuum in Libya. We were keen for the Libyans to take the lead. Everyone knows the dangers of a completely U.S.-owned postwar environment. We might have used a heavier hand, but there’s no guarantee it would have made a difference.”","626","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Other officials were more blunt about the limits of the intervention. The senior Administration official believed that three failures had led to the fiasco in Libya: “The lack of a single national-security apparatus, replaced by militias; a real terrorist problem, which was small but has gotten much worse; and a proliferation of arms. How does the world respond to all this? The U.N. gets a mandate, goes there, and finds out there’s no one to work with—the ministries are Potemkin. The I.M.F. goes in, says what’s wrong, and doesn’t do much about it. The World Bank hardly does anything. Vast numbers of people came to Libya to look for contracts, but nobody got any money, so they went away. NATO tried to design a national-defense system, but the Libyans failed to engage with them. The French were going to train three thousand police. Instead, they trained thirty. Then some cadets were sent to Jordan for training, but the Jordanians kicked them out after they burned down a sports facility, because they were angry about a flight delay.” In November, the official noted, three hundred Libyan soldiers being trained in the U.K. were expelled after half a dozen of them ran amok in an English village, sexually assaulting several women and raping a man. “The Libyans defeated everyone,” he said. “It didn’t matter whether you were Gandhi or Stalin. It didn’t matter how hard we tried, they defeated us all.”","627","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"When I asked the official to explain the current U.S. policy toward Libya, he said, “It’s a sensible one: a ceasefire, an inclusive government, no way forward but political.” He detailed the way a ceasefire might play out. “Will this work?” he asked. “Maybe, maybe not. But what I am telling you is that it is the best policy the U.S. and other Western powers can come up with.”","628","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"I spent two weeks in Libya, crossing it from east to west, and the only other Westerners I encountered were a few British security consultants and two German journalists. Everywhere I went, Libyans stared at me. Occasionally, young men asked where I was from. When I said that I was American, some joked about jihadists and the possibility of my being abducted and beheaded. At the entrance to the town of Sousa, near Derna, officials admonished my Libyan companions for bringing a Westerner there, asking, “What if something happens to him?”","629","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Unlike many other cities and towns in Libya, Tripoli presented an image of normality. Traffic flowed, and groups of young men wearing Italian sportswear hung out drinking coffee from paper cups. Here and there, at government ministry compounds, I saw groups of bearded men with guns, but none of the tanks and battlewagons that had traversed the capital after Qaddafi’s fall. Yet Tripoli’s air of calm belied an underlying tension that was evident as soon as I came into contact with the men who were running things.","630","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Just as Haftar insists, improbably, that all his opponents are terrorists, the leaders of Libya Dawn insist that there isn’t a single extremist in their ranks. Jamal Zubia, the director of the foreign-media department, assured me that, until Haftar began attacking, Ansar al-Sharia was closer to a mutual-aid society than to a terrorist organization. A large, white-bearded man who returned to Libya after sixteen years in England, Zubia speaks excellent English, with a Manchester accent. “If you ask the people of Benghazi about Ansar al-Sharia, they will tell you it always does charity, it secures the hospitals, the roads,” he said. “If they want a place to be secure, they will ask Ansar al-Sharia to be there.”","631","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Zubia compared the allegations that Ansar had committed terrorist acts with the Algerian military’s efforts to prevent Islamists from coming to power in the early nineteen-nineties. The Algerian intelligence services had framed the Islamists, he said: “They imported a container of beards to put on and go kill people and then said they were Islamists.” He added, “This is true. You can’t deny it. It’s on YouTube.”","632","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Zubia said, “If Haftar says he wants to fight terrorism, logic says he should go to Derna, not Benghazi. In Benghazi, they have never belonged to Al Qaeda, while in Derna, anyway, there are fifty people who say they are with ISIS.” Zubia wore a derisory expression. “As for the hundreds of people Haftar says were killed in Benghazi, where is the proof? You will find that Haftar is responsible for all those killings.”","633","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Until 2005, he claimed, Haftar’s family had received an annual stipend of two hundred thousand dollars from Qaddafi—“You can go on YouTube.” (Haftar has acknowledged that, as a former P.O.W., he got a stipend from Qaddafi, but says that it ended in 1993.) More recently, Zubia said, Haftar had “come to Tripoli and tried to form a militia, but failed.” And, he added, one of Haftar’s sons had been wounded trying to rob a bank. (In fact, Haftar’s son Saddam was shot by Zintani militiamen outside a bank.) Zubia described Haftar and his family as a kind of criminal enterprise. “I ask you to use your intelligence,” he said.","634","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Indisputable information is difficult to come by in Libya. Everyone feverishly monitors Web sites where pictures are posted and things proclaimed and discussed, but most of what passes for news is political propaganda, pure and simple. Dignity has a TV station, which broadcasts footage of Haftar on inspection tours of the Benghazi battlefield, set to martial music, along with gruesome clips showing the victims of the other side’s violence. Libya Dawn has a similar channel, presenting the opposite view of the conflict. Each side discounts the other’s reporting, and, in the absence of news, outrageous gossip is quickly accepted as fact. In a meeting near Benghazi, an economist soberly relayed to me the preposterous claim that Bernard-Henri Lévy had been paid forty million dollars to lobby for the Muslim Brotherhood’s interests in Libya.","635","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Many of Haftar’s supporters in eastern Libya believe that the Muslim Brotherhood is engaged in an international conspiracy, backed by the U.S., to take over the Middle East; when I asked for evidence, the answers tended to start with Obama’s June, 2009, speech in Cairo, in which he announced a “new beginning” for relations between America and the Muslim world. Haftar, in his office, speculated that this was the real reason that the U.S. was not supporting him. “Maybe it’s because of the Muslim Brotherhood,” he said. “They have a lot of clout, and a factory for producing lies.”","636","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Perhaps the only point of agreement between Dignity and Libya Dawn is the primacy of oil in the country’s future. As the two sides have struggled for control of oil fields, production has plunged, from 1.6 million barrels per day to barely three hundred thousand. A couple of days before I met Haftar, his jets had bombed an armored column from Misrata as it advanced on facilities held by his proxies, and he described the advance as a kind of moral affront. “You will hear of our response in a few days,” he promised. Two weeks later, his MIGs carried out air strikes against Misrata’s airport. Of the Misratans, he added, “If they do anything more than they have already done, they will pay a heavy price.”","637","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"At a press conference in Tripoli, General Obeidi, Libya Dawn’s chief of staff, spoke of his troops’ efforts to “recover the oil fields” from Haftar’s forces. “We are the state,” he said. “It’s our duty to retake the fields from these bandits.” Afterward, I spoke with General Mohamed al-Ashtar, a high-ranking Libya Dawn commander, who told me that his men were advancing on the oil terminal of Ras Lanuf when they were hit by Haftar’s jets. In order to avoid damage to the facilities, he claimed, he had ordered his troops to withdraw, but now they had Haftar’s men surrounded. “We are waiting for them to answer our conditions so they can withdraw and hand over the facilities,” he said.","638","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"In the following weeks, according to the analyst Frederic Wehrey, the fight devolved into a stalemate: “fixed lines of static warfare, with both sides lobbing rockets.” As the fighting goes on, the country’s remaining oil money flows through the central bank, where it is disbursed without discrimination to militias and criminal gangs on both sides.","639","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"

"Libya’s best hope of a bipartisan political solution is its constitutional assembly, in the provincial capital of Beyda, a small city of Qaddafi-era apartment blocks—unpainted concrete structures surrounded by uncollected trash. The assembly building provides an exception to Beyda’s ugliness; built in 1964, for Libya’s parliament, it is a modest domed edifice surrounded by lawns and trees. Since April, a group of assemblymen have been working there to draft a constitution; among the fifty-six members are both Dignity and Libya Dawn supporters. The president of the assembly, Ali Tarhouni, is one of the country’s most respected public figures. It is Tarhouni’s job to keep the assembly on task, and to make sure that the conflict stays outside the building.","644","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"A floppy-haired economics professor in his early sixties, Tarhouni returned to Libya from Seattle, where his family lives, in early 2011. He had not been home since 1973, when he fled Libya for the U.S. The year before he returned, he told his son, “I knew that I’d never see Libya again, and would die without returning.” But when the uprising against Qaddafi began Tarhouni agreed to join the National Transitional Council, which had been formed to steer the revolution. I met him in a safe house in Benghazi, as the first French air strikes were hitting Qaddafi’s armored column outside the city. Tarhouni spoke matter-of-factly about the events that were reshaping the country, but he smiled rapturously as he told of visiting his home town of Marj, not far from Haftar’s base. He had forgotten how green it was, he said. When Tripoli fell, Tarhouni, who went on to serve as finance minister, exultantly told a crowd in Martyrs’ Square that they were “free.”","645","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"When I visited Tarhouni at his Beyda apartment one evening, he chain-smoked Marlboro Lights and reflected on what had happened in Libya. “I still can’t figure out what brought us to this,” he said. “We thought with the revolution we had brought about new green spring shoots, but what we came up with is thorns.” Like Haftar, Tarhouni wanted most to go back to the U.S. and spend time with his family. But, when things started falling apart, he felt that he “had to do something,” and agreed to head the constitutional assembly. Although he remained committed to his job, he was not optimistic that the assembly would achieve much. “To keep this group of people safe and away from the national split is a daily struggle. And, even if we come up with a constitution, what can you do with a constitution in a situation like this?” He looked dismayed. “Qaddafi was around for forty-two years—that’s a really long time. One of his legacies was to show that things are settled only by force. It was the one policy he had that was constant. This created a culture of ‘with or against,’ and that is a problem.”","646","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"Since September, a U.N. diplomat named Bernardino León, flying in a small plane from a base in Tunisia, has been shuttling between the warring factions. León told me he knew that he was running a precarious initiative, “with only one chance of success, compared with many paths to disaster.” So far, he has had little luck. After early talks in Libya stalled, he announced a round in Geneva, but neither Haftar nor his foes agreed to take part. At the House of Representatives, Abubakr Buera, a senior parliamentarian, ticked off a list of unacceptable interlocutors: the Tripoli government, the G.N.C., and anyone from Libya Dawn. “If any of them come, we won’t go,” he said. “We don’t want the international community to intervene,” he added. “Now is not the right time to stop fighting. It’s the solution.” Even the levelheaded Ali Tarhouni reluctantly favored a resolution through combat. “A lot of people are waiting for Haftar,” he said. “The only moderates in this country are the ones who are forced to be. The military situation has to mature more before the conditions are ripe for a dialogue.”","647","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"
"In early February, representatives of the G.N.C. and the H.O.R. began new talks in Libya, but Haftar and his military opponents didn’t join them. Many of Haftar’s men welcome the chance for more fighting. I spoke to Colonel Abdul Raziq al-Nadori, Haftar’s rough-hewn chief of staff, at a sprawling base outside Tobruk. “Dignity started because our soldiers were being slaughtered and beheaded,” he said. “We had no intention of fighting our brother revolutionaries, but they joined those terrorists, so we had no choice.” Like Haftar, Nadori believed that the war would have to be won in Tripoli, but he hoped that civilian casualties could be kept to a minimum, if people fled the city. He regretted the reticence in Washington. “We want good relations with the U.S. It was Qaddafi, may God not rest his soul, who prevented us from having those relations. But the U.S. sees the Muslim Brotherhood as a moderate force. We see them as snakes with smooth skin.” Nadori had been trying, without success, to schedule a meeting with David Rodriguez, the head of the U.S. Army’s Africa command. “There are ISIS training camps here in Libya—Rodriguez himself has said so,” he told me. “So what are you waiting for? We’re not asking you to bomb them. We’ll do it.

"After Qaddafi fell, Obama appeared in the Rose Garden to congratulate the Libyan people on an “opportunity to determine their own destiny in a new and democratic Libya.” Then he added an ominous disclaimer: “We are under no illusions. Libya will travel a long and winding road to full democracy.” Haftar is not fighting for democracy; he is a military man at heart. But, in a country full of militias and increasingly hospitable to Islamist extremists, his offensive may yet provide a small hope for stability. If military pressure can persuade the moderate members of Libya Dawn to break with the extremists in their ranks, it might help to create two mainstream factions that are at least willing to agree on the terms of negotiations. But, many Libyans told me, if Haftar does not prevail over the jihadists in Benghazi and Derna, the country will lurch closer to being what the British special envoy Jonathan Powell described to me as a “Somalia on the Mediterranean.”","649","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling"

When I saw Haftar at his base, he had spoken confidently about his plan to “purify the country.” But there was more fighting ahead, and he lamented the lack of help from the United States. The aid from Egypt and the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia had been modest, and, as his army grew, its demands were outstripping supplies. “We are a very rich country,” he reminded me. “We want our people to have good homes, good schools. We had hoped for Libya to be God’s heaven on earth. But we need infrastructure, new buildings, factories. We have oil, gold, uranium, and seas of sand. We need a superpower to help us develop these things.

Iago, inflated with spite, skulks around, looking to stir up mutiny against his boss. He finds his target in Michael Cassio, a handsome young lieutenant and Othello’s protégé. In one of the Western canon’s great deployments of peer pressure, Iago plies Cassio, who has confessed to “very poor and / unhappy brains for drinking,” with wine, and tricks him into initiating a violent fight with the former governor of Cyprus. Othello appears, furious, and puts Cassio—sputtering, pitiful—on speedy public trial. Iago craftily testifies against him. “But men are men,” he says, making a show of his reluctance to crush his prey.

Not so for Lewinsky. “Overnight, I went from being a completely private person to being a publicly humiliated one worldwide,” she says. When it came to her shame, Starr was only the tip of the iceberg. The iceberg was the rest of us.","660","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"
"A frightening, terrible thing about shame is how difficult it is to dispel. Guilt, at least, can be absolved through action. You apologize to the friend you gossiped about; you donate ten per cent of the $6.3 million cash bonus you got as the C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs to charity. Guilt is the discomfort that comes from recognizing that you’ve done something wrong, or failed to do something right. It’s an emotional accountability mechanism—the way that the self takes itself to task.","661","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"
"Shame, on the other hand, is a social feeling, born from a perception of other people’s disgust, a susceptibility to their contempt and derision. You see yourself from the point of view of your detractors; you pelt yourself with their revulsion, and as you do you begin, like Cassio, to lose track of the self altogether. Someone else’s narrow, stiffened vision of who you are replaces your own mottled, expansive one. As Lewinsky listened to the recordings of her phone calls, she tells us, she heard her voice as if it belonged to a different person: “My sometimes catty, sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth.” It was “the worst version of myself, a self I didn’t even recognize.”","662","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"
"That feeling of estrangement from the true, variegated self is expressed time and time again in “So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed,” a new book by the journalist Jon Ronson, to be published by Riverhead next week. Ronson interviewed scores of people who have been cut down by collective vilification in our post-Lewinsky, social-media-soaked age. He wants to trace the shame phenomenon to its root, and the taxonomy that he comes up with includes those who have been shamed for doing dumb things in the professional realm (Jonah Lehrer making up those Bob Dylan quotes; the former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey creating a bogus official post for his secret male Israeli lover); those who have been shamed for doing dumb things in what they mistakenly considered to be the private realm (Justine Sacco, the P.R. person who sent out an unfortunate joke about AIDS in Africa to her two-hundred-odd Twitter followers before boarding a plane to Johannesburg, only to discover, when she landed, that her tweet had gone viral and that she had lost her job); those who have been shamed for doing things that seem perfectly acceptable by any common measure, public or private; and those who have been shamed for spuriously shaming others. (These last two are linked in a kind of reputation murder-suicide, in which a woman at a tech conference, overhearing a man making an anodyne joke to his friend, published his photo on her blog along with a post claiming that he had made her feel unsafe. He immediately lost his job; in what passes for virtual justice, she was then flooded with rape and death threats, and was fired in turn.)","663","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"
"One of those stuck in the digital stocks is Lindsey Stone, a young woman who worked as a caregiver at a residence for high-functioning adults with intellectual disabilities. On a field trip to Washington, D.C., a fellow-employee took a silly picture of Stone posing in front of a sign calling for quiet at Arlington National Cemetery, pretending to shout and flipping off the camera. The photo was posted on her friend’s private Facebook account, and then leaked to the wider Internet. Stone was attacked as a veteran-mocker and a traitor; in a pattern that has proven remarkably consistent in cases of shaming that have little to do with professional conduct, she lost her job.","664","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"
"Ronson contacted Reputation.com, a company that specializes in cleaning up its clients’ tainted online presences by burying unpleasant or troublesome information underneath a heap of new Web sites and social-media posts. It agreed to take on Stone’s case pro bono, and one of its strategists set about making her a new digital persona. Are cats important to her? Does she like to travel? Could she conceivably be the kind of person who unblushingly wishes Disneyland a happy birthday on Facebook? “We’re going to introduce the Internet to the real Lindsey Stone,” the strategist says, as he sets about doing the reverse. The procedure worked. Lindsey Stone, threat to patriots everywhere, became Lindsey Stone, fan of Lady Gaga’s jazz album. It’s like plastic surgery for the personality: one false self is replaced by another, equally and oppositely grotesque.","665","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"
"Ronson arrived at his subject as an enthusiastic novice shamer, having participated in various Twitter campaigns intended to call out organizations like the Daily Mail for doing things like publishing homophobic columnists. Using shame to embarrass powerful institutions into changing offensive policies is an old tactic, and often an effective one—it’s the operating strategy of Human Rights Watch, for example. Yet a strategy designed to target major newspapers and oppressive regimes wreaks havoc when focussed on individuals, as Ronson soon discovered. He speaks to psychologists, visits prison programs where inmates are treated with kindness rather than brutality, and reads about the Stasi’s encouragement of East Germans to inform on their neighbors. His conclusion—and Ronson is a social observer with a comic temperament, not a gavel-banging moralist—is that we’ve been swept up into accepting and nurturing a culture of increasingly severe moral punishment, corrosive to the shamed and the shamer alike. “I’ve worked on dark stories before—stories about innocent people losing their lives to the FBI, about banks hounding debtors until they commit suicide,” he writes, “but although I felt sorry for those people, I hadn’t felt the dread snake its way into me in the way these shaming stories had.”","666","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"

"Which brings us back to Lewinsky. In her TED talk, she speaks of her anguish at watching other young people suffer through experiences like hers, with more drastic consequences and for behavior far less risky than having an affair with a sitting President—young people like Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers freshman who committed suicide in 2010 after his roommate captured him on a webcam kissing another man. “We need to return to a long-held value of compassion—compassion and empathy,” Lewinsky says. “Online, we’ve got a compassion deficit, an empathy crisis.”","668","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"
"You might be inclined to find this argument soggy. I was so inclined, at first. I was ten when the Lewinsky scandal broke, and by the time I reached the age that Lewinsky was I sympathized with her situation, but not with her. Yes, the way she was thrown under the bus by Clinton and his Administration was outrageous, but how could she enter into a situation like that and expect it to end well? She didn’t deserve the brutal treatment she got, but she seemed too naïve to be taken altogether seriously. Lewinsky’s latest call for compassion seemed to me a slice of classic TED optimism, packaged to go down easy—soft sentiment where there should be unrepentant ferocity.","669","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"

She was compassionate enough to expect that, like her, her interrogators could be moved by a human sympathy that trumped politics to see the complex, confused, affectionate, hurting person underneath the caricature. Lewinsky, back in the public eye, is tough enough to admit that she’s still soft—that she’s not only a thinking person but a feeling one, too. We should be tough enough to expect the same of ourselves.","671","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/monica-lewinsky-and-the-shame-game"
"Last year, Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of the anti-poverty confederation Oxfam International, was named a co-chair of the World Economic Forum’s planned meeting in Davos, Switzerland. This month, as the Davos conference was about to begin, Byanyima’s organization released an eye-catching report about the concentration of global wealth in the hands of several dozen billionaires, among them a number of Davos regulars. Oxfam’s publication, a follow-up to a report released around this time last year, found that the eighty people atop the annual Forbes list of the planet’s richest individuals have amassed about the same amount of wealth as the billions of people who make up the world’s poorest half. It also found that the richest one per cent of people in the world own forty-eight per cent of the world’s wealth—a share that, if it keeps growing at the current rate, will pass fifty per cent by next year. “The scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering,” Byanyima said in a press release attached to the report.","January 28, 2015","672","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"Byanyima’s comment and the Oxfam report were purposefully timed. The unequal distribution of global wealth figured prominently in Davos discussions this year, and the report garnered coverage in prominent news outlets around the world. Even Hillary Clinton referenced it, in a speech in Winnipeg. But some prominent journalists—Felix Salmon, of Fusion, and Ezra Klein, of Vox—have challenged the report’s findings. “This version of Oxfam’s report is just as crap as the last version,” Salmon writes. Salmon and Klein make similar criticisms, related to how the report takes debt into account.","673","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"","674","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"To calculate the wealth of the bottom half of the population, Oxfam used research by the Credit Suisse Research Institute, which found that global household wealth—that is, assets like housing and investments, minus debts—totalled two hundred and sixty-three trillion dollars last year. The poorest half of the world’s adults own less than one per cent of that amount—less than two trillion dollars. Oxfam worked down from the top of Forbes’s list of the world’s billionaires, adding up their net worth until it reached the amount held by the poorest half. It took only eighty billionaires to get there.","675","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"Salmon and Klein argue that this method is misleading, because the wealth estimates all take debt into account. Going into debt is far more common in the U.S. and Europe than in less developed places, where it’s more difficult to access credit. “So for the purposes of Oxfam’s calculation, a farmer in China’s rural Sichuan province with no debt but also very little money is wealthier than an American who just graduated from medical school with substantial debt but also a hefty, six-figure income,” Klein writes. For that matter, Klein points out, Hillary and Bill Clinton, who were in debt when they left the White House, would have been poorer, too. In a sense, being able to go into debt is a privilege—and the greater a person’s status, the greater his access to debt often is. (It’s hard to imagine the Clintons being denied a loan.) In other words, Oxfam’s measure of wealth, which counts the most indebted person in the world as the poorest, includes a number of people who, by global standards, are quite privileged.","676","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"Klein and Salmon make a legitimate point—but it doesn’t matter much at all to Oxfam’s broader conclusion about the wealth gap. True, the organization’s figure would seem to lump indebted American doctors and former Presidents with less fortunate indebted people and poor, but not indebted, people in the developing world. But data suggests a strong correlation between households’ income levels and their net worth; as the former rises, so does the latter. In other words, people with high incomes but negative net worth are the exception, not the rule. To factor out those people, you can drop the bottom ten per cent of the wealth distribution from Oxfam’s calculation; this group includes those whose debt exceeds their wealth (not only high-income earners but also people with lower wages whose debt outweighs their wealth), plus some people with no wealth or small amounts of it. The rest of the bottom half still holds only about $2.6 trillion, versus the figure of under two trillion that Oxfam used to arrive at the marquee eighty-billionaires statistic.","677","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"On Monday, Nick Galasso, an Oxfam researcher, responded to critics in a blog post, calculating that the new $2.6-trillion figure amounts to the wealth held by the hundred and forty-seven richest people in the world. That doesn’t make for quite as striking a headline, but this version of the calculation doesn’t do much to change the share of wealth held by the richest one per cent in the world, either: it falls from 48.1 per cent to 47.9 per cent, Galasso found. (Salmon, in his post, adds up the wealth of some in the poorest half who have positive net worth, but he doesn’t discuss how this impacts Oxfam’s over-all conclusions.)","678","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse Research Institute report from last year whose data Oxfam used, considers the criticism from Klein and Salmon about debt to be a “silly argument.” “That’s a non-issue. It’s a diversion,” he told me. Debt is a perennial problem when using net worth to measure inequality, but other approaches, like comparing income and consumption, pose challenges of their own. Comparing income, for example, can make a rich, but unemployed, heir to a fortune held in a tax haven seem poorer than a fast-food worker. And comparing consumption, which usually involves looking at purchases of household staples, makes rich people and poor people look more similar than they are: “I don’t think Donald Trump drinks more milk or eats more bread,” Galasso told me. As the economist Branko Milanovic pointed out in a blog post on the Oxfam report, economists generally choose the most appropriate approach for their particular goal. (Milanovic, for his part, has found that global income inequality may be decreasing, but he told me that he finds Oxfam’s approach, in showing a rise in wealth inequality, to be sound. “The methodology is quite established and most of the critiques are misguided,” he wrote in an e-mail.) Galasso said that Oxfam chose to focus on wealth, in this case, because wealth is associated with power, political and otherwise, and Oxfam worries about the concentration of power in the hands of the affluent élite; Klein, of Vox, discusses this in his post. (I wrote about the link between riches and power in a post about Sheryl Sandberg’s wealth that discussed last year’s report from Oxfam.)","679","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"This isn’t to suggest that Oxfam’s report doesn’t have genuine flaws. For instance, Shorrocks joins Salmon in taking issue with another high-profile aspect of Oxfam’s report: its projection about the future. Oxfam, by examining the trends since 2010 and extrapolating into the future, shows the wealth share of the top one per cent going up and up; it passes fifty per cent by next year, and rises past fifty-four per cent by 2020, painting a picture of a world in which wealth becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of the élite. But, Shorrocks said, this extrapolation assumes that the global economic trends since the recession will continue to play out exactly as they have so far.","680","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"The main reason the super-rich have seen their wealth expand so much since 2010 is that stocks have risen a great deal. Affluent people are much more likely to hold stocks than the poorer half of the population, so they’ve benefitted more. But, with European economies in crisis, the Russian economy floundering, and Chinese growth slowing, stocks may not keep rising forever—or even for the next five years. “If asset prices go on increasing as they have since the financial crisis, then it’s quite likely that [Oxfam’s] projection will be correct,” Shorrocks told me. “But it is conditional on that, and I don’t think anyone’s really expecting that to happen.”","681","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/critics-oxfams-poverty-statistics-missing-point"
"There are so many people who consider Chris Christie a true friend, according to Chris Christie. This isn’t just a matter of love but of legality, because New Jersey’s ethics rules stipulate that the state’s governor has more leeway in accepting gifts from his personal friends than from, say, businessmen with an interest in the Port Authority, or from the king of a Middle Eastern country. Unless, that is, the governor is a guy like Christie, whom no mogul or monarch could resist. According to a report in the Times, when Christie was asked why King Abdullah of Jordan “picked up the tab” for a weekend getaway for the governor—and three of his children, his wife, her mother, his mother, and his stepfather—his office cited the true-friend rule. “King Abdullah invited the governor and his family to Jordan as his personal guest so the two families could spend time together,” a spokeswoman told the paper. They’d met at a dinner given by Mike Bloomberg, a detail that was somehow offered as proof that the relationship was real. The family time included a thirty-thousand-dollar bill at a Kempinski hotel and “a Champagne reception in the desert.”","February 3, 2015","682","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"

"True friendship was also the reason Christie didn’t worry about going to football games with Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys. As I’ve written before, one of the puzzles in that story, as in this one, is whether Christie believes his own excuse—that his wealthy hosts take disinterested pleasure in his company—or is offering it cynically. The first suggests a delusional faith in his own charm (and that of his stepfather, mother-in-law, etc.), the other an openness to trading on his office. Neither is good, and both make him vulnerable.","684","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jersey-jordan-chris-christies-friendships"

Christie also signed an executive order that made it possible for interest groups and foreign governments to pay for him to go around the world, as a travelling advertisement for New Jersey.

(See Ryan Lizza for more on the Christie-Adelson relationship.) Part of that trip was paid for by a group called Choose NJ, which, the Times noted, “is financed by companies that are forbidden by pay-to-play laws to donate to the governor.” Its president is a neighbor of Christie’s. Choose NJ paid for a Christie trip this week, which is why his measles-abetting remarks about parental choice and vaccines were issued from the United Kingdom.

Earlier that day, Mark Halperin, of Bloomberg, reported that one factor Romney and his circle had considered was what they saw as Christie’s unsustainability: “Thanks to the 2012 veep vetting process, Romney became intimately familiar with some of the less publicized controversies from the New Jersey governor’s past, and believes that several of those flaps would mushroom so broadly that Christie soon would be eliminated from consideration by voters and donors.” There was a similar message in “Double Down,” the book that Halperin wrote with John Heilemann. Still, Romney and Christie had dinner Friday night. Whatever doubts Romney may have about Christie, he apparently doesn’t want to help Jeb Bush.

If it’s Clinton vs. Christie, there will be private planes spotted in all directions. If it’s Clinton vs. Bush, there will be no dodging of dynasts. We may be looking forward to a campaign defined by operatives leaking duelling flight manifestos, questionable consulting agreements, and intemperate statements by former Presidents turned campaign surrogates.

"On Tuesday night, for once, the policy contents of the speech may well dominate things. Over the weekend, White House aides let it be known that President Obama will propose raising taxes on the very rich, to pay for tax breaks for the middle class. More specifically, he wants to increase the tax rate on capital gains for high earners, from 23.5 per cent to twenty-eight per cent, and he also wants to remove the so-called “step up in basis” loophole, which allows rich families to reduce, often greatly, the amount of taxes they pay on their estates. The money generated by these changes would be used for a variety of purposes, including a modest tax cut for middle-class married couples, an expansion in wage subsidies to low-paid workers, and an expansion of tax credits for students in higher education.","691","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"This is a good plan. Explaining the thinking behind it, Dan Pfeiffer, a senior White House official, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” “It’s the simple proposition that, now that the economy is in a stronger place than it’s been in a very long time, we need to double down on our efforts to deal with wage stagnation and declining economic mobility.”","692","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Of course, with the Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, the chances of the proposals being enacted anytime soon are practically nil. Speaker John Boehner immediately dismissed them as old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberalism. Since the plan isn’t going anywhere, it’s perhaps tempting to dismiss it as meaningless. But that would be an error. Simply advocating tax cuts for the masses will reshape the politics of the next couple of years, and, particularly, the 2016 Presidential election.","693","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, assuming she gets the nomination, will come under pressure to match and top the White House proposals. After all, she can hardly run for President while saying that her big idea is to carry out a plan proposed by her predecessor. I would be willing to wager that Clinton, or any other Democratic candidate, will subsume the President’s proposals in a bigger and bolder plan to help the sagging middle class. And there is plenty of room to expand upon Obama’s ideas. In a seventeen-and-a-half-trillion-dollar economy, thirty-two billion dollars a year, on average—which is roughly the sum that tax hikes and a new levy on big banks would raise, according to Obama Administration officials—is a very modest sum. In fact, it’s equivalent to only about a fifth of one per cent of G.D.P. Any Democratic candidate who is flying around the country talking about the need to offset decades of rampant growth in inequality will surely be tempted to increase the stakes.","694","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But perhaps the most interesting aspect of Obama’s plan is what it augurs for the G.O.P. nomination fight. To be sure, there’s very little chance that any of the Republican candidates will embrace the idea of raising tax levies on the rich. Many of those expected to run have signed Grover Norquist’s pledge never to raise taxes under any circumstances; reneging would plunge them into an unholy war with the right. “Raising taxes on people that are successful is not going to make people that are struggling more successful,” Senator Marco Rubio, who also appeared on “Face the Nation,” said. “The good news about free enterprise is that everyone can succeed without punishing anyone.”","695","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But just because Rubio and his fellow Presidential hopefuls won’t support the first half of Obama’s plan doesn’t mean they can’t embrace the tax-cutting half. To the contrary, it’s easy to imagine middle-class tax cuts emerging as a central issue in the G.O.P. primaries, with the candidates vying to outdo one another. And, unlike Hillary and her economic advisers, the G.O.P. hopefuls are unlikely to be overly concerned with how to pay for the giveaways they propose.","696","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"Such unconcern would represent a bit of a change. Ever since the Great Recession sent the budget deficit soaring to ten per cent of G.D.P., Republicans have struggled to reconcile their old Reaganite religion of supply-side economics with their claims that Obama was bankrupting the country. When Mitt Romney, in 2012, said that he would cut everybody’s taxes by twenty per cent without raising the deficit, but didn’t identify spending cuts, his plan was widely ridiculed. Famously, the Tax Policy Center, a recognized non-partisan authority on such matters, described the proposals as “mathematically impossible”—a judgment from which Romney’s campaign struggled to recover.","697","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"
"But the economic environment is changing, which means that the political environment is also shifting—and not in the direction that tends to prompt concern for fiscal responsibility. In fiscal 2014, which ended on October 1st, the deficit was just 2.8 per cent of G.D.P. That means that it is nearly back to its average level over the past forty years. With G.D.P. growth buoyant, the deficit is likely to fall further this year. When deficits are low, they begin to recede from the public consciousness, and charges of fiscal recklessness carry less heft.","698","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-tax-cut-plan-start-bidding-war"

Obama’s plan is a model of financial rectitude: modest tax cuts and spending programs financed by clearly identified increases in taxes and fees. That’s very laudable.

Rubio, together with Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, recently proposed a two-tier tax system in which most people would pay a rate of just fifteen per cent.

"By issuing a preliminary injunction blocking President Obama’s new immigration policy just a couple of days before it was due to go into effect, Judge Andrew S. Hanen, a conservative George W. Bush appointee who sits on a federal court in Brownsville, Texas, has dented the hopes of millions of undocumented aliens and turned himself into a hero of the right.","February 17, 2015","703","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"“President Obama abdicated his responsibility to uphold the United States Constitution when he attempted to circumvent the laws passed by Congress via executive fiat, and Judge Hanen’s decision rightly stops the President’s overreach in its tracks,” Greg Abbott, the new Republican governor of Texas, said in a statement hailing the ruling. “The District Court’s ruling is very clear—it prevents the President from implementing the policies in ‘any and all aspects.’ ” Late last year, when Abbott was serving as the state attorney general, he filed a lawsuit in which Texas and sixteen other states challenged the President’s announcement that the federal government would no longer seek to deport undocumented parents of children born in the United States—a policy shift that would have lifted the threat of forced removal from about four million people. (The number of states involved in the suit eventually rose to twenty-six, mostly G.O.P. run.) Ted Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, echoed Abbott’s comments, saying, “The Texas court decision … is a major turning point in the fight to stop Obama’s lawless amnesty…. Last summer, we saw a humanitarian crisis on our southern border that was a direct consequence of Obama’s previous amnesty. Republicans are now standing together to try to insure that it never happens again.”","704","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"

"If that last sentence was a shout-out to Judge Hanen, who was appointed to the bench in 2002, it was surely justified. Known in Texas as a vigorous enforcer of immigration laws, Hanen, contrary to Abbott’s suggestion, was careful not to get drawn into the question of whether President Obama has the constitutional authority to enact a big change in immigration policy without the approval of Congress. As I pointed out when Obama initially announced the plan, last November, most legal experts believed that the White House was on firm ground, constitutionally speaking.","706","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Rather than ruling on whether Obama violated the Constitution, Hanen based his opinion, which runs to a hundred and twenty-three pages, on a much narrower issue: Did the Department of Homeland Security, in preparing to enact the President’s policy change, fully follow the laws governing the introduction of important new administrative rules by federal agencies? No, Hanen said, and argued that by failing to provide for a public comment period about the new deportation procedures, in which interested parties could register their support or their concerns, the department had violated the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Therefore, the new procedures had to be halted before they went into effect.","707","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"On the basis of this narrow ruling, immigration policy is now on hold for an indefinite period. The Administration’s appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, could take many months to resolve, and whichever way that court rules the case may well go all the way to the Supreme Court. If D.H.S. decides to hold public hearings about the new policy, as Hanen says it should have done, it could take up to a year.","708","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"In Washington, where every day provides another opportunity to wage partisan warfare, twelve months is an eternity. The ruling had barely been issued when attention shifted to the battle du jour, which just happens to be over immigration reform and the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. Fearful that the new rules about deportations would go into effect before Hanen or anybody else had a chance to stop them, the Republicans have been threatening to defund the entire department unless the new funding bill includes measures designed to gut immigration reforms. Democrats, relying on a filibuster, have refused to allow such a proposal to advance.","709","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"On the basis of what passes for common sense outside the Beltway, you might suspect that the Republicans, once Judge Hanen had done their work for them, would declare victory and move onto other issues. But no. “We will continue to follow the case as it moves through the legal process,” Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. “Hopefully, Senate Democrats who claim to oppose this executive overreach will now let the Senate begin debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security department.” Translated into English, this means that Republicans are still threatening to close down the department at the end of next week if they don’t get their way. Or, in the words of Ted Cruz, “At a time when we face grave national-security threats, at home and abroad, it is the height of irresponsibility for the Democrats to block this funding in an extreme attempt to save Obama’s amnesty, which a federal judge has just declared illegal.”","710","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Only in the upside-down world of Washington does refusing to accept “you win” as an answer make sense. Boehner may have been reëlected handily at the start of the year, but he still needs the support of rank-and-file G.O.P. members, many of whom campaigned vigorously against any suggestion of amnesty for the undocumented. Just a few weeks into a new term, the Speaker can’t risk being outflanked on the right. And so it’s onward into battle.","711","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"It barely needs saying that, from a longer-term perspective, the Republicans’ attitude toward immigration policy is mightily self-destructive. If they shut down the Department of Homeland Security, an arm of government that a Republican President created to protect the citizenry from terrorist attacks, the public backlash will be immediate and savage. And if Republicans, in the months ahead, stick with a posture toward undocumented immigrants that Hispanics and other minority groups perceive as unremittingly hostile, they will be gravely undermining their prospects in 2016. The hopes of the Democratic candidate, whether it is Hillary Clinton or somebody else, rest on getting a big turnout. And in Hispanic areas, there is no surer way of generating a big turnout than by stoking concerns about immigration policy.","712","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"Many Republicans know this, of course. Jeb Bush, reacting to Judge Hanen’s ruling on his Facebook page (which serves as the principal communication vehicle for his nascent campaign), sought to shift the blame to Obama, accusing him of overstepping his authority and failing the leadership test. “The millions of families affected across the country deserve better,” Bush said. “Now, more than ever, we need President Obama to work with Congress to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system.”","713","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"The G.O.P. front-runner will need to do better than that. Back in June, 2013, the Senate, with the encouragement and involvement of the White House, passed a comprehensive immigration bill that had the support of fourteen Republicans, including John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio. The legislation included funds for twenty thousand new border-patrol agents and seven hundred miles of electric fencing. And it provided a convoluted, thirteen-year pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who could show that they had obeyed the law and paid their taxes. It died in the House of Representatives, and eventually the White House looked for a way to do an end-run around Congress.","714","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"
"If Boehner and his colleagues resurrected and passed the Senate bill tomorrow, Obama would sign it in an instant. It’s not going to happen, of course, and that’s why Hanen’s ruling, although it has given Republicans something to cheer about, could end up helping to deprive them of the White House. If the new deportation system were to go into effect as planned, it would have been up and running for more than eighteen months come Election Day, and there wouldn’t have been any real prospect of it being reversed. Like Obamacare, another Republican hate object, it would have become a fact on the ground.","715","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/immigration-gop-wont-take-you-win-for-answer"

"In December, Jeb Bush posted an update on his Facebook page which began by reporting that, over Thanksgiving, he and his family had “shared good food and watched a whole lot of football.” He added, “We also talked about the future of our nation. As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States.”","717","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The wording of the announcement was oddly diffident. It was widely known that Bush had been “actively exploring” the possibility of a campaign at least since the spring, when he started showing up at the gym in the grand Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, where he keeps his office, with a personal trainer and new workout gear. But there had been as yet no signs of a commitment. “It’s the telegraph people have been waiting for,” Jim Nicholson, a former Republican National Committee chairman and Cabinet secretary under President George W. Bush, said.","718","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The announcement inevitably renewed questions about the desirability of political dynasties and about whether Jeb was being propelled to run, in part, by fraternal rivalry. “There’s always been a friendly competition among the siblings in the family, and that’s just human nature, I suppose,” George P. Bush, Jeb’s older son, told me. As Jeb, who was the governor of Florida for two terms, has followed his brother’s career, he has also stood apart from it. “There is kind of George W.’s world, and then there’s Jeb’s world, and frankly there’s not a lot of intersection,” Mark McKinnon, who was a senior adviser to George W.’s Presidential campaigns, said. Jeb is more introverted and more ideological than both his father, George H. W. Bush, whose politics are driven more by personal associations than by doctrine, and his brother, whose conservatism is more instinctual than considered. It was Jeb who signed the nation’s first “Stand Your Ground” self-defense law, and fought to keep Terri Schiavo on life support.","719","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Now, though, as a result of the rightward shift in the Republican Party, Bush is being viewed as a moderate in the emerging Presidential field. He has strong support among the Party’s establishment and donor class, but his popularity among the current conservative rank and file is difficult to gauge. Since he left office, Bush has maintained a national profile through his work on the issue with which, as governor, he had sought to make his biggest mark: education reform. But, after leading the way in pushing a conservative vision for America’s schools, Bush is now caught in the midst of an unexpected upheaval on the issue within his own party.","720","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"His level of enthusiasm for running has also been difficult to assess. He has often cited worries about the effect that a campaign would have on his family, especially on his wife, Columba, who dislikes the role of political spouse. George P. Bush told me that it would be hard for his father to relinquish the life in business that he has led since leaving office, in 2007. “People forget that before he went into public service he was in real estate and has always had a business mind,” his son said.","721","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The family that, over three generations, has served in the White House (twice), the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the governors’ mansions of two states is also a family of businessmen. Prescott Bush was a partner at the investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman, but, even as he thrived on Wall Street, with a house in Greenwich, Connecticut, and three live-in maids, he declined to run for a vacant House seat in 1946, because he didn’t think he could afford it. He was finally elected to the Senate in 1952, at the age of fifty-seven. His son George H. W. Bush didn’t enter politics until he had become a millionaire in the Texas oil industry; he was elected to Congress in 1966, when he was forty-two. Doug Wead, who served as an adviser to both Presidents Bush, told me, “I don’t think it’s about money for money’s sake. It’s a way of defining who I am and where I sit in the history of the family: ‘Can I do it? Can I be a real man?’ Just imagine the pressure. The first step in life in the Bush family is: Can I make a million?”","722","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"After college, Jeb worked for the Texas Commerce Bank in Venezuela before returning to join his siblings—George; their younger brothers, Neil and Marvin; and their sister, Dorothy—on their father’s 1980 Presidential campaign. Jeb campaigned mostly in Florida; having learned enough Spanish to court his wife, whom he met on a high-school exchange trip to Mexico, he had become fluent while in Caracas, an asset in Miami’s Little Havana. After George H. W. Bush lost to Ronald Reagan in the primaries, Jeb and Columba settled in Miami to raise their three children—George P., Noelle, and Jeb, Jr.","723","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Armando Codina, a Cuban-American real-estate developer who had supported George H. W. Bush’s campaign, offered Jeb a forty-per-cent stake, with no money down, in his company, Codina Partners. Bush’s role was to find tenants for commercial developments, and he easily won over colleagues and clients with his unassuming manner. A few separate deals he was involved in came under scrutiny, including one with a company that sold water pumps in Nigeria, but Bush was never accused of any wrongdoing. He considered running for Congress, but, according to Peter and Rochelle Schweizer’s biography “The Bushes,” his father persuaded him to wait until he had made more money. He served as the chairman of the Dade County G.O.P. and, in 1987, became the state commerce secretary under Governor Bob Martinez but left the post less than two years later to work on his father’s successful Presidential campaign. Around that time, he decided to run for governor, and, in 1992, with his father’s reëlection in doubt, he began to focus on a gubernatorial campaign for the 1994 election. (By then, he had a net worth of more than two million dollars.) In Texas, his brother did the same, which the family viewed as an intrusion on Jeb’s more serious effort. After Bush senior left the White House, he spent far more time campaigning in Florida than in Texas.","724","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Unlike George, Jeb embraced the ascendant right-wing orthodoxy: he declared himself a “head-banging conservative”; vowed to “club this government into submission”; and warned that “we are transforming our society to a collectivist policy.” On Election Night, he lost narrowly to the incumbent, Lawton Chiles. George Bush, having shown himself to be an unexpectedly able candidate, with a more modulated tone than his brother, beat the incumbent Texas governor, Ann Richards, by more than eight points.","725","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"After the loss, Jeb returned to business, working primarily with Codina Partners again. It wasn’t clear if he would continue to pursue a political career. Tom Slade, a former chairman of the Florida G.O.P. (who died in October), told me that Bush had said, “I don’t know if I’m going to run for governor again or not, because I’d rather go settle some stuff with my wife.” Campaigning had been a strain on the family, but, Slade added, “I remember having heard Columba say, ‘Jebby really loves politics,’ and kind of sigh.”","726","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"It became apparent to Bush that he had emphasized a conservative agenda at the expense of an organizing mission in his campaign. He had focussed mainly on crime and welfare reform, and, if he were to run again, he would need “to be sure his platform was palatable to a larger community,” as T. Willard Fair, the head of the Miami affiliate of the Urban League, put it. In 1995, Bush found that platform. Early that year, he called Fair and said that he wanted to contribute some money left over from his campaign to the Urban League. Fair thought that Bush would present a check, pose for a picture, and leave. But the two men spent ninety minutes discussing the failure of the Dade County schools to educate black students, who were twenty-four per cent more likely than white students to drop out. Fair, a garrulous man with a conservative bent, told me, “Jeb said, ‘Why don’t you start a charter school?’ I said, ‘What’s a charter school?’ ”","727","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"That year, Bush found a compatible source for ideas on education when he joined the board of the Heritage Foundation, which was generating papers and proposals to break up what it viewed as the government-run monopoly of the public-school system through free-market competition, with charters and private-school vouchers. Bush found school choice philosophically appealing. “Competition means everybody gets better,” he said.","728","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"He enlisted Fair to help promote a state law authorizing charter schools, which, unlike vouchers, were gaining some Democratic supporters, including President Bill Clinton, who saw them as a way to allow educators to innovate within the public-school system. The law passed in 1996, with bipartisan support, and that year Bush and Fair founded the first charter school in the state—an elementary school in an impoverished, largely African-American section of Miami, called the Liberty City Charter School. Bush brought his mother in for classroom visits and dropped by unannounced to make sure that things were running smoothly. If he found wastepaper lying around, he’d leave it on the desk of the principal, Katrina Wilson-Davis. The message was clear, she recalls: “Just because kids are poor and at risk doesn’t mean that their environment shouldn’t be clean and orderly.”","729","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Bush decided to make a second run for governor, in 1998. He chose Frank Brogan, Florida’s education commissioner, as his running mate, and railed against the state’s graduation rate, which was about fifty per cent, and fourth-grade reading scores that were nearly the worst in the country. He unveiled the A+ Plan, which relied heavily on Heritage Foundation proposals for holding schools more accountable; it imposed a strict A-F grading system at all levels, based on students’ scores on the state’s assessment test, the FCAT, and provided additional funding to schools with good grades and stipulated that students at schools with poor grades would receive taxpayer-funded vouchers to attend private and parochial schools. This time, Bush won easily. He faced a weaker opponent than he had in 1994, but his new agenda seemed to help: he doubled his share of the black vote.","730","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Brogan, a former fifth-grade teacher and middle-school principal, was nominally in charge of the education portfolio. But Bush’s most influential adviser was Patricia Levesque, a former legislative aide to the state House Republican leadership and a graduate of Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist Christian school in South Carolina. (She greeted a new hire in Bush’s administration by asking him if he had “found a church home” yet in Tallahassee.) Brogan had drafted the A+ Plan into a bill, but Bush called for revisions to give its accountability measures a harder edge. Within months, the Republican-led legislature had passed it, providing Florida with one of the highest-stakes testing regimens in the country, and the first statewide voucher program.","731","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Some friends and associates saw personal motivations behind Bush’s initiatives. Patrick Riccards, who, as counsel for the federal government’s National Reading Panel, discussed education reform with Bush, said, “As the father of Hispanic kids, you become far more sensitive to disparities—kids who look like your kids not getting the skills they need or getting into the right colleges.” (Bush’s children attended private schools in Miami and Jacksonville.) Others detected a competitive desire to surpass his brother’s agenda in Texas. Governors around the country were taking up education reform, but the Bushes were prominent in the field. George W. Bush had initiated his program four years earlier, but it essentially built on Ann Richards’s measures to help struggling schools, such as insuring that they got adequate funding, and it had bipartisan support. It was also far less aggressive—it emphasized testing, but included fewer penalties for failing schools and steered clear of vouchers. Sandy Kress, who was a senior education adviser to George W. Bush in the White House, said that he “really thought this is mainly about improving public schools.”","732","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Jeb’s program, by contrast, was of a piece with his larger agenda to privatize state-run services, from prisons to Medicaid. He also recognized the long-term political benefits of upending the system. According to Jim Warford, a county school superintendent in North Florida, whom Bush selected to be his K-12 schools chancellor in 2003, “He saw the teachers’ unions as one of the foundations of the Democratic Party, and he saw a great advantage—that anything he could do to undercut the teachers’ union would have a political return.”","733","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Advisers to both brothers saw little evidence that they discussed the issue. “They operated through their staffs,” Warford said. “If anything, a more accurate comparison would be two N.F.L. coaches trying to steal each other’s playbooks and game plans.” But if Jeb was envious when George was elected President, in 2000, he did not express it. “If he has any of that feeling, he doesn’t show it,” Lucy Morgan, who covered him for the St. Petersburg Times and knows him socially, said. Instead, he further immersed himself in education research, and brought in national experts, such as Reid Lyon, a brain-development researcher at the National Institutes of Health, for private briefings. Even his opponents concede that he was very well informed. Dan Gelber, a Democrat who served in the Florida legislature, recalls an e-mail debate with Bush about the rating system for test scores. “We ended up having this very esoteric exchange, and I remember thinking, He either has a roomful of experts writing these e-mails or he really knows something.”","734","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"During his first term, Bush’s agenda suffered some setbacks. Voters approved a referendum capping class size at twenty-five students in high school and required smaller classes in lower grades. Courts ruled his main voucher program unconstitutional, because it sent taxpayer money to religious schools. In response, he adopted a funding model in which corporations donated to the program in return for tax credits. Still, after a term that also featured a big tax cut for wealthy Floridians, he was easily reëlected, in 2002.","735","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By then, President Bush was implementing his signature legislation, the No Child Left Behind Act, which required schools to meet gradually higher scores on annual tests, set by the states, in order to receive additional federal funding. Jeb Bush made it known that he thought his own approach superior, because it sought to grade schools on improvements in individual students’ scores, rather than just on schools’ performance in a given year. “There were lots of conversations about the work in Texas and how Florida had improved on that,” Warford said. According to education officials, Jeb’s team had little respect for Rod Paige, the former Houston schools superintendent whom George W. Bush had named Secretary of Education. “It was a little prickly in Florida,” Sandy Kress, who worked on the implementation of No Child Left Behind, said. “It was ‘We’re going to do it our way and can do it better.’ ”","736","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Florida’s population grew by 2.5 million during Bush’s eight years as governor—almost the equivalent of adding another Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, and St. Petersburg. Suburbs colonized the former swamplands beyond the Miami airport, the orange and palmetto groves east of Tampa, and the farmland near Fort Myers. The growth, which created jobs in construction and real estate, was fuelled, notoriously, by lax mortgage-lending practices. But it was also fuelled by charter schools.","737","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Developers of new subdivisions teamed up with companies that were opening up charter schools less as a means to innovate than as a way to benefit from Florida’s boom. The “McCharters,” as they became known, were paid for with public money—not just their daily operations but often their buildings, too, since Florida was one of a few states that allowed taxpayer revenue to be used for the construction of charters. But, as charters, the schools were free of public oversight and collective-bargaining agreements. In Osceola County, outside Orlando, a charter school was built next to a traditional public school to absorb students from an expanding subdivision—a “win-win-win for everybody,” Bush said at the ribbon-cutting ceremony.","738","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Under the 1996 law, only nonprofit groups could apply to open a charter school. To get around that, for-profit charter companies set up foundations to file the application and then hire those companies to operate the schools. The St. Petersburg Times reported that by 2002 for-profit companies were managing three-quarters of the state’s newly approved charter schools. According to the newspaper, the companies typically took at least a twelve-per-cent cut of a school’s budget—about two hundred thousand dollars a year for an elementary school and double that for a middle school or a high school. At the same time, the charters were spending about two thousand dollars less per student than traditional public schools (which received relatively low funding, by national standards), a practice that often resulted in inexperienced teachers and spartan facilities. Still, many parents were attracted by the schools’ selective aura, smaller class size, and strict behavior codes. The principal of Ryder Elementary, which served families employed at the Miami headquarters of the Ryder trucking company, explained, “We really operate like a private school.”","739","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"This struck some people as being far from the spirit of charter reform. “Should we be paying money for real-estate companies posing as charter schools?” Sherman Dorn, an education-policy expert who taught at the University of South Florida, said to me. Teachers’ unions and some Democratic legislators spoke out against the for-profit schools. But, in 2002, Bush signed a law allowing charter operators who were denied approval by local school boards to appeal to the state. In 2003, he signed a law to eliminate the state’s cap on the number of charters, which had been set at twenty-eight in the largest counties. Republican lawmakers fought to increase the amount of taxpayer money available for charter construction, and to let developers build schools using the subdivision homeowner fees that they used for pools and other amenities.","740","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Bush, like other proponents of education reform, wanted parents to have the freedom to choose from various schools. “Florida has the largest, most vibrant charter-school movement in the country,” he said at the opening of a for-profit charter high school in Fort Myers. He had no personal financial stake in the school boom, a point that his spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, emphasizes. “Governor Bush does not personally profit in any way from his education-reform advocacy work,” she said. (Bush declined to be interviewed for this article.) But some of his political allies in the state did. In 1997, Jonathan Hage, a former Heritage Foundation staffer who had helped Bush set up the Liberty City Charter School, started Charter Schools USA. Hage told the St. Petersburg Times that he had simply identified a “classic business opportunity.” Charter Schools USA, whose headquarters occupy a building across from a Jaguar dealership in the Fort Lauderdale suburbs, now manages seventy schools in seven states and has nearly three hundred million dollars in revenue.","741","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In 2004, Robert Cambo, a former Codina Partners employee who had started his own building firm, worked with Hage’s company to develop two schools. Al Cardenas, who became the chairman of the Florida Republican Party in 1999, went on to be a lobbyist for Charter Schools USA and the Florida Consortium of Charter Schools. (Until recently, he was the chairman of the American Conservative Union.) Octavio Visiedo, a Bush family friend, was the superintendent of the Dade County school system. He retired in 1996 and started a company that evolved into Imagine Schools, which now has thirty-four thousand students nationwide. Cardenas, who advised Visiedo as he set up the company, told me that the Governor’s support for the growing industry was pivotal: “Bush was helping me get the movement going.” When asked about the money to be made in for-profit charters, Cardenas said, “I don’t care about how much money someone makes. I care about how they’re educating kids. It’s kind of socialistic to decry an organization for making money. What people should be concerned about is what’s the quality of it.”","742","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The quality was difficult to assess. By 2006, Jeb’s last year in office, there were more than three hundred charter schools (for-profit and nonprofit) in Florida, with more than a hundred thousand students, most of them in big metropolitan areas such as Miami and Tampa. But the state made only sporadic efforts to track their performance. The 1996 law called for annual statewide reports on the schools, but none were produced until November of 2006. Test scores in lower grades were found to be slightly higher than at traditional public schools, and slightly lower in the higher grades. The reading test-score gap between black students and white students in elementary grades decreased at about the same rate as in traditional schools, but in the charter high schools the gap widened. However, direct comparisons were difficult, because the charters took about twenty per cent fewer low-income and special-needs students. It was even harder to track the impact of vouchers, because the private and parochial schools that accepted them were not required to administer state tests.","743","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"As Bush saw it, some schools and companies were inferior, but that situation would sort itself out over time. Kristy Campbell told me, “Expanding school choice was a priority for his administration.” However, she added, just as with traditional public schools, Bush “believes charter schools should be closed if students aren’t learning.” Frank Brogan, Bush’s lieutenant governor, told me, “The Governor is a free-market guy.” But Andy Ford, the president of the Florida Education Association, the teachers’ union that was trying to halt the spread of for-profit charters, believes that although Bush “does genuinely care about trying to make kids’ lives better,” his approach created “a closed circuit of people making a lot of money on so-called ‘reform.’ ”","744","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By the end of Bush’s second term, fourth-grade reading scores in the state had improved sharply, though eighth- and tenth-grade scores were more middling. (Since Bush left office, gains in test scores at all levels have been relatively incremental; graduation rates have steadily increased, but they remain among the nation’s worst.) Nevertheless, Bush saw his education record as his central accomplishment. “The fact is that more kids are learning now and we’re not dumbing down the curriculum,” he said.","745","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"When Bush left office, in 2007, he and Columba returned to Miami. He signed on with a commercial-real-estate brokerage, started a management-consulting firm—Jeb Bush & Associates, with Jeb, Jr.—and joined at least four corporate boards. Again, one of the ventures he was associated with—InnoVida, a startup maker of inexpensive building materials—ran into legal difficulties, but again he was not implicated. He also became a paid adviser to Lehman Brothers, just before the financial crisis, and gave the kinds of remunerative speech that former governors tend to give.","746","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Bush continued to stay active in education policy. In 2008, he launched the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a nonprofit that promoted his reforms and urged other states to adopt similar practices. The organization, led by Patricia Levesque, holds an annual two-day, expenses-paid summit for school administrators and elected state officials. The foundation also organized a half-dozen state education commissioners—called “chiefs for change”—to promote Bush’s agenda at conferences around the country.","747","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By this time, school reform had become a bipartisan national movement. No Child Left Behind had made its mark across the country, as local leaders, such as the mayors Michael Bloomberg, in New York, and Cory Booker, in Newark, championed their roles in raising scores, and many Democratic leaders, including the newly elected President, Barack Obama, and his Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, accepted the necessity of testing-based accountability. (The Administration’s Race to the Top initiative rewarded states that engaged in aggressive reform.) Meanwhile, as teachers and administrators struggled to meet the law’s demands, the education industry responded. For more than a century, private companies had sold textbooks and other educational supplies to public schools, but now, particularly with the advent of the Internet, the marketplace exploded. The range of new offerings included the state tests. In Florida alone, the British publishing conglomerate Pearson was paid two hundred and fifty million dollars over four years, to administer the FCAT. Then there were test-prep products, mostly digital, that promised to improve scores by helping teachers track students’ progress. (Neil Bush had entered the field, with Ignite, an education-software firm geared toward middle-school social studies, science, and math, which he started in 1999.)","748","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In 2010, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. launched an education-technology division, called Amplify. It was led by Joel Klein, who had been the New York City schools chancellor under Bloomberg. Murdoch said, “When it comes to K through 12 education, we see a five-hundred-billion-dollar sector in the U.S. alone that is waiting desperately to be transformed.” Amplify’s products include digital tablets loaded with instructional programs and games (in one, Tom Sawyer battles the Brontë sisters), for use in K-12 classes. The company says that it has sold several hundred thousand tablets to schools across the country.","749","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Companies soon came to see the Foundation for Excellence in Education as an ideal platform to promote a range of ideas and products to state officials. Murdoch gave the keynote address at the 2011 summit. In 2012, the foundation earned revenues of ten million dollars, much of it donations from education companies. Those companies sent representatives to the summits, where foundation officials set aside time for them to have “donor meetings” with the chiefs for change.","750","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Sometimes, according to e-mails obtained by the watchdog organization In the Public Interest, Levesque pitched the state commissioners on behalf of the companies. In July, 2011, she encouraged Chris Cerf, the New Jersey commissioner, to accept an offer from Dell of a demo “teacher dashboard,” a digital classroom-management system. (“Public education is a public enterprise,” Cerf told me. “But it’s also true that, like all public entities, it also relies on collaborations.”) In 2012, Levesque e-mailed Tony Bennett, the Indiana commissioner, urging him to consider an overture from Reasoning Mind, which sells a math software program for grades two through six. She told Bennett that Jeb Bush “would really appreciate you and your staff taking time to meet with” the company’s president “when you get a chance to review his curriculum.”","751","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In 2010, Bush had used the foundation to launch an initiative called Digital Learning Now, which promoted the benefits of “virtual schools,” providing online instruction. Virtual schools had once been a fringe market for families that homeschooled their children. But, as more school districts faced budget cuts and overcrowded classrooms, some required students to take classes online—in all grades, but mostly in high school—and the industry surged. The quality of instruction is uneven. Classes are typically two or three times larger than in traditional schools, and teachers, who work from home, earn much less. In 2012, the National Education Policy Center studied one of the largest virtual-school companies, K12, and found that its students lagged in math and reading proficiency and had lower graduation rates than those in traditional schools. In a statement at the time, K12 disputed the N.E.P.C.’s methodology.","752","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Yet Bush, a longtime technophile, saw in virtual schools the same revolutionary potential to expand choice that he had seen in vouchers and charters. Unions consider virtual schooling “an even bigger threat than vouchers because it’s such a disruptive idea,” he told National Review. In 2010, he convened a “digital learning council” that included virtual-school executives from around the country. It issued a report urging states to adopt industry-friendly measures, such as eliminating limits on virtual-school enrollment. Several states proceeded to do so. In Maine, according to a 2012 investigation by the Portland Press-Herald, foundation staff members essentially wrote legislation backed by the Republican governor, Paul LePage, to expand virtual schools. “I have no ‘political’ staff who I can work with to move this stuff through the process,” Maine’s education commissioner had e-mailed Levesque, after meeting her at a foundation summit. Levesque replied, “Let us help.”","753","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"One entrepreneur who had seen the potential of the school-reform boom was Randy Best, a legendarily eccentric Texan with a knack for buying and selling. While a student at Lamar University, in the nineteen-sixties, Best started a class-ring and jewelry business, which he and his partners sold for twelve million dollars. That was followed by an eclectic array of ventures: art galleries, clinics, cattle yards, oil and gas, defense and aerospace, and Girl Scout-cookie manufacturing. He spent much of his wealth on a personal natural-history collection that included a seven-foot-long Egyptian sarcophagus lid, a Siberian cave-bear skeleton, and sabre-toothed-tiger skulls from the Pleistocene period.","754","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Best had perceived a vast potential market in school reform back in the mid-nineties, when George W. Bush was governor of Texas. “There’s nothing else as large in all of society. Not the military—nothing—is bigger,” Best later told Mother Jones. In 1995, he launched Voyager Expanded Learning, a for-profit chain of after-school tutoring programs in Dallas, and started donating money to George Bush’s 1998 reëlection campaign. That year, the Governor appeared at a photo op in front of a Voyager banner, calling for twenty-five million dollars in the next year’s budget to fund for-profit after-school programs.","755","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Best hired early-reading experts who had worked on Bush’s reforms to transform Voyager into a phonics-based early-literacy curriculum. No Child Left Behind created a billion-dollar Reading First program, with the aim of improving instruction in the early grades, and federal education officials held up Voyager as a curriculum that met the program’s standards. In Texas, legislators passed an unusual mandate that required school districts to spend twelve million dollars on Voyager. By 2005, Voyager was being used in more than a thousand districts in all fifty states.","756","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The company’s extraordinary success attracted scrutiny. A 2006 Department of Education inspector general’s audit and a 2007 report by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee found that Reading First officials had been paid generous “consulting” fees by some of the companies whose services they were recommending, including Voyager. George Miller, the Democratic chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, said that the situation was “very close to a criminal enterprise.” In 2007, a major comparison of reading programs conducted by the Department of Education found that Voyager had “potentially negative effects,” because students using it showed a decline in comprehension. Best says that neither he nor Voyager officials were contacted or questioned by any regulatory or investigative bodies.","757","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"By then, Best had sold Voyager to ProQuest, a Michigan company, for three hundred and sixty million dollars. In 2007, he started another Dallas-based company, Higher Ed Holdings, later renamed Academic Partnerships, which persuades public colleges to attract more students by outsourcing to the firm their master’s-degree programs in fields such as business and education. The company puts the courses online, recruits students from a call center in Dallas, and takes a large percentage of the tuition revenue—between fifty and seventy per cent. It has contracts with more than fifty colleges nationwide, although it hasn’t been welcomed everywhere. At the University of Toledo, the education faculty blocked the contract because, as Leigh Chiarelott, then the head of the department, told me, there were serious concerns that “we’d be almost like a diploma mill.”","758","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Best needed someone to lend credibility to the company. Florida had spent heavily on Voyager during Jeb Bush’s governorship, and, in 2005, when Bush was still in office, Best spoke with him about going into the education business. By 2011, Bush had joined Academic Partnerships as an investor and an adviser, and he became the company’s highest-profile champion. Best told the Washington Post that Bush’s annual salary was sixty thousand dollars, but he did not disclose the terms of Bush’s investment stake. For the first time, Bush was making money in an educational enterprise. But Campbell, Bush’s spokeswoman, is careful to draw a distinction between his work for Academic Partnerships and his education advocacy, noting that Academic Partnerships is involved in higher education, not K-12 schools.","759","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In July, 2011, Bush sent letters to college presidents inviting them to the company’s first big marketing conference, at the Four Seasons Hotel near Dallas. Speakers included Tony Blair and the former Australian Prime Minister John Howard. Last spring, Bush recorded an infomercial inviting people to attend another Dallas conference, in March. This time, the speakers were Thomas Friedman, Fareed Zakaria, and Hillary Clinton, who opened her remarks with praise for Bush’s work on education. He was, she said, someone who “really focused on education during his time as governor in Florida and has continued that work with passion and dedication in the years since.”","760","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"As governor, Jeb Bush had been among those who noted one of the biggest problems with the No Child Left Behind law: standards varied greatly from state to state, depending on how ambitiously officials designed their tests and defined their success. In 2009, a coalition of governors and state education officials came together and, with financial support from the Gates Foundation and the implicit backing of the Obama Administration, devised a new set of standards intended to raise the calibre of instruction nationwide. The states broke into two consortia, each of which designed a set of tests around the new standards, called the Common Core.","761","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The effort was bipartisan, and, at the beginning, all but four states signed on to it. Jeb Bush was not directly involved, but he was a vocal supporter of making tests and standards more consistent across the country, as part of his philosophy of full accountability for schools. The Common Core, he said, was a “clear and straightforward” path to “high, lofty standards.” In March of 2011, he appeared onstage at Miami Central High School with President Obama and Arne Duncan, who were in town to promote the Administration’s policy. “Education achievement is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue,” Bush said. “It is an issue of national priority.” Obama thanked Bush for coming to the event, adding, “We are so grateful to him for the work that he’s doing on behalf of education.”","762","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"To avoid the standards being viewed as a federal mandate, the Administration had left their creation to the states. But it initially made states’ acceptance of them a requirement for receiving funds under its Race to the Top initiative. Conservative activists quickly seized on the standards as another example of Obama’s big-government overreach, along the lines of the Affordable Care Act. (They referred to the standards, inevitably, as Obamacore.) The Koch brothers, the talk-radio hosts Glenn Beck and Michelle Malkin, and the Heritage Foundation joined the attack. (Bush had left the Heritage board when he ran for governor the second time, in 1998.) “The élites in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party don’t get this,” a lawyer for the American Principles Project, one of the groups leading the backlash, said.","763","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"In June, 2011, Jeb Bush and Joel Klein, newly installed at News Corp., co-wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed headlined “The Case for Common Educational Standards.” A month later, an e-mail went out from the Foundation for Excellence in Education to the chiefs for change, alerting them that the upcoming convention of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, with which the foundation was usually allied, was going to take up a resolution against the Common Core. The e-mail urged the commissioners to lobby legislators attending the convention to oppose it.","764","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"The campaign against the standards particularly threatened Tony Bennett, the Indiana commissioner, a rising Republican who was one of the chiefs for change. In many states, the commissioners are appointed, but in Indiana they are elected. In 2012, the Tea Party organized opposition to Bennett’s reëlection; e-mails between Bennett’s office and the foundation that summer are full of alarm about the “black helicopter crowd.” In November, Bennett lost to an anti-Common Core Democrat who had Tea Party backing. Several potential Republican Presidential candidates for 2016—including the governors Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, Bobby Jindal, of Louisiana, and Mike Pence, of Indiana, all of whom had supported the Common Core—backed away from the standards, as did Florida’s governor, Rick Scott. Last April, Bush told Fox News, “Others that supported the standard all of a sudden now are opposed to it. I don’t get it.”","765","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Meanwhile, several of the chiefs for change whom Bush was relying on to promote the standards were leaving office. Early last year, New Jersey’s Chris Cerf took an executive position at Amplify, which in 2013 had won a $12.5-million contract to develop a digital library of student-assessment tools from one of the state consortia that were developing the Common Core-based tests. Such movement from the public sector to the private is routine, but it underscored a central critique of the standards from both the left and the right: that, because the new testing regime required states to buy new test-prep materials, curricula, and even computers on which to take the tests, they were essentially another sales opportunity for the education industry. A headline on the Web site of the libertarian magazine Reason in July claimed that “Common Core Is Crony Capitalism for Computer Companies.”","766","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"A decade and a half earlier, Bush had been in the vanguard on conservative school reform. But, last September, he was not invited to the Values Voter Summit, the big annual event in Washington, D.C., for Republican politicians seeking to build support among religious-right activists. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, which hosts the summit, explained at a news conference that “Jeb is a very nice guy, but he has a challenge among real conservatives for aggressively pushing for Common Core.” He added, “That’s a huge problem.”","767","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"
"Since Bush left the statehouse, the for-profit charter-school industry in Florida has continued to grow; the two largest chains have doubled their enrollment, to more than fifty thousand students. For-profit charters now spend half a million dollars a year on lobbying, and they contribute heavily to political campaigns. Charter Schools USA alone gave more than two hundred thousand dollars to candidates for state office in the 2012 elections. The industry so dominates the field, particularly in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas, that it has discouraged the expansion in Florida of highly regarded not-for-profit networks, such as KIPP and Green Dot. But questions about for-profit operations continue to mount.","768","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"

The Miami Herald reported last April that the audit is examining the company’s practice of leasing space from development firms controlled by the Zuluetas. A 2006 Miami-Dade County audit determined that this arrangement, at one cluster of Academica schools, had cost taxpayers $1.3 million.

It was hard to question the conviction underlying his remarks, but his delivery was phlegmatic. Todd Lamb, a former education adviser to President George W.

"Early today, my editor e-mailed to ask if I’d write about Mitt Romney’s upcoming announcement. The e-mail contained a link to a story from Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin, which said that Romney was planning to hold an 11 A.M. conference call with some financial donors, to “update” them on his thoughts about running for President a third time.","781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Halperin wisely avoided reaching a definitive conclusion on whether Romney was going to confirm his entry to the 2016 contest. He did suggest, however, that this was the likeliest reason for the conference call: “Based on all the conversations I have had with Romney World this week, I would bet that Mitt and Ann Romney’s proposition, that if he runs he will become the Republican nominee, is about to be tested.”","782","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"

"By the time I’d had breakfast and subjected my Twitter followers to a few thoughts about the new G.D.P. figures, the online mulching machine had converted Halperin’s qualified wager into a general consensus that Romney was all in. The Daily Beast, evidently convinced that it had the inside track, published a story headlined “Romney Will Run For President,” which it tweeted out with an “EXCLUSIVE” label.","784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"The Daily Beast story was picked up everywhere, and as eleven o’clock approached, the tension was palpable. (O.K., I made up that last bit.) What, exactly, would Romney say? On January 9th, he had said—to another group of donors, of course—“I want to be President.” A few days after that appearance, the Washington Post reported that he was “almost certain” to enter the race. Just this past Wednesday, talking at Mississippi State University, he took a jab at Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, noting, “How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn’t know where the jobs come from in the first place?”","785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"Reading all of this, it would be just about possible to imagine, if you tried hard enough—or if you were a Republican political operative looking for another well-paid gig—that the idea of Romney entering the G.O.P. race and winning the nomination for a second time was a realistic proposition rather than a fantasy.","786","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"
"To take this position, you would have had to convince yourself that New Romney would be able to live down his “forty-seven per cent” comment and the fourteen-per-cent tax rate he paid in 2011; that Jeb Bush hadn’t already occupied the role of wise establishment elder; and that it was of no consequence that many influential people connected with the Republican Party regard Romney as an out-of-touch loser, whose presence on the ticket would guarantee the Democrats another victory in 2016. (Rupert Murdoch, in describing Romney a few weeks ago as “a terrible candidate,” was only voicing publicly what many other Republicans were saying privately.

They began with a few sentences of thanks for the people around the country who had encouraged him to run.

"So that was that, then? Not quite. In fact, Romney’s statement went on for another eight paragraphs. After citing a poll showing him leading the other putative G.O.P. contenders by nearly two to one, the statement said, “So I am convinced that we could win the nomination.” It went on, “I also believe . . . I would have the best chance of beating the eventual Democrat nominee.”","790","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"

In fact, I expect and hope that to be the case.”","791","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mittster-bows-out"

From the Republican Party’s perspective, the 2016 race is already shaping up to be another extended exercise in the art of drilling a circular firing squad. Adding a Romney-versus-Bush element to the emerging narrative would have benefited only the media and the Democrats. On Thursday, we learned, via a leak to Politico’s Mike Allen, that Hillary Clinton is considering waiting until July to announce her candidacy. That’s smart.

"When Rand Paul launches his campaign for President today, in a speech in Louisville, he is unlikely to talk about serving as an Army general or, for that matter, saving the lives of Naval officers in the South Pacific. Nor will he speak of publishing a newspaper, leading one of the nation’s most prestigious universities, or directing the C.I.A. That, of course, is because he’s done none of these things; these were the qualifications of candidates in previous Presidential elections. What Rand Paul actually did in the years before 2011, when he took office as the junior senator from Kentucky, was to work as an ophthalmologist and to moonlight, in the off-hours, as an anti-tax activist.","April 7, 2015","797","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Is this enough to qualify him for the Presidency? Or is that question hopelessly beside the point to the Republican voters who are considering carrying his banner? Whatever Paul’s liabilities might be in the battle for his party’s nomination, his lack of experience does not appear to be one of them. He is, after all, hardly alone; the field is full of neophytes. Other than Jeb Bush, not one of the serious Republican contenders played a meaningful role in our national life before 2010, the year that Paul and Marco Rubio—who will announce his own candidacy next week in Miami—ran for the Senate. Scott Walker was elected governor of Wisconsin that same year. Ted Cruz has been in the Senate only since 2013—though it seems longer, because he hasn’t stopped talking since he got there.","798","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"

"Sifting through these candidates’ speeches, one finds few indications of past experience—little use, even, of the past tense. To the extent that they have anything to say about their own lives, it concerns, in most cases, their childhoods. They stress, in practiced fashion, their modest roots. Rubio describes himself as the “son of a bartender and a woman who worked in a hotel.” Walker tells audiences that he is the “son of a small-town preacher and a mom who was a part-time secretary.” (In the opening passage of his budget address in February, he offered even humbler detail: “Mom was raised on a farm where they didn’t have indoor plumbing.”) Cruz, meanwhile, dedicated the first six minutes of his announcement speech last month to stories about his parents’ struggles, and said more about them than he did about himself.","800","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Paul’s upbringing, by contrast, is double-edged. His father, Ron Paul, is, of course, an icon of the libertarian right, which confers, on the son, a certain kind of credibility—just not the hard-won, hardscrabble kind that candidates since Andrew Jackson have sought. At the Conservative Political Action Conference, in February, Rand Paul allowed a bit opaquely that “I was born into the America that experiences and believes in opportunity.” (If you thought he was from the America that doesn’t believe in opportunity, you were wrong.) He has had little else to say about his life, or life’s work, prior to his decision that it merits his leading the free world. The aptness of ophthalmology as a metaphor for national leadership (“I see a great nation,” as F.D.R. said) remains, at this point, unexploited.","801","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Paul is not the only Republican who appears unsure whether, or how, to talk about his work experience. Ted Cruz has spent almost all of his adult life as a litigator—in private practice and as solicitor general for the state of Texas, from 2003 to 2008. In that role, Cruz helped lead the fight to establish an individual right to bear arms and to defend the constitutionality of a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. All in all, it is a career that would make him a strong choice for attorney general in somebody else’s Administration, a little lower on the org chart than he’s aiming. Marco Rubio could make something of his career as a state legislator (and stint as House speaker) in Florida, and probably will; it’s the only experience he’s got.","802","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"Scott Walker should have a stronger claim of executive experience than Rubio, Cruz, or Paul—governors, as a rule, are expected to decide things and do stuff (which is conduct unbecoming of a United States senator). And Walker does have a standard rap about what he’s accomplished in Wisconsin: mostly that he’s “put the power back in the hands of the hard-working taxpayers” (except the hands that hold union cards). Yet Walker’s attempts to inflate his credentials have only diminished them, comically so. His much-derided comment that battling public-sector unions is good training for fighting terrorists (“If I can take on a hundred thousand protestors, I can do the same across the world”) was a warmup, it turned out, for his also-derided claim that his tenure as a teen-age Eagle Scout led him to “be prepared” for the dispatch of soldiers into battle.

"Jeb Bush has plenty of experience, but admits it only under duress. In a Q. & A. session at CPAC, Sean Hannity pressed Bush to talk about his two terms as governor of Florida. “Here’s the record,” Bush answered a bit testily. “And it’s a record that may be hard for people to imagine, because it’s a record of accomplishment, of getting things done.” This is precisely the problem; some of the things Bush got done then or has supported since—immigration reform, Common Core standards—provoke fits in Republican primary voters. Bush’s reluctance to talk about his governorship—paired with his pained ambivalence about his family name—gives his candidacy a feeling of disconnectedness, an emptiness at its core. “It can’t be about the past, can’t be about my mom or dad or brother,” Bush told Hannity. What it can be about remains an open question.","804","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"The Republicans’ résumés—Bush’s excepted—are not notably thinner than Barack Obama’s was in 2008. For all his appeal as a candidate, plenty of Democrats did wonder whether a man who’d never run anything but the Harvard Law Review was actually prepared to be President. This was the thrust of Hillary Clinton’s campaign (“ready on Day One”) that year as well as John McCain’s (“I know how the world works”). Obama turned those opponents’ experience against them, rendering each one as a weary embodiment of the status quo. His inexperience underscored the entire rationale of his candidacy—its novelty, the break it represented with the past. Obama calculated, rightly, that he had little to gain by spending another term or two in the Senate.","805","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"
"But as Rand Paul and his peers hasten to point out, none of them is like Obama. The point of gaining experience is not to acquire credentials, or wear different, increasingly impressive hats, or learn how to do things like run a complex organization or operate heavy machinery, but to learn from it—to test ideas and abandon the dumb ones, to evolve, to improve. Some leaders, like Obama, gain that kind of insight by their mid-forties; others never do. The troubling thing about Rand Paul and the other Republican hopefuls is their indifference—indeed, their proud resistance—to the kind of experience that broadens one’s perspective and changes one’s mind. Paul “is exactly the same person he was 25 to 30 years ago,” a former aide to Paul’s father told a reporter on the eve of today’s announcement. “He hasn’t really changed.” Only at a high-school class reunion or in a Republican Presidential primary would that be meant as a compliment.","806","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rand-paul-and-the-problem-of-political-experience"

"I’ll get to that in a minute. First, back to the G.O.P. Presidential hopeful heading toward a courtroom confrontation with his local airport authority. It’s Donald Trump, of course. Speaking on a New York radio show over the weekend, Trump announced that he, too, is seriously—no, “very seriously”—considering a tilt at the Oval Office. “I’m going to Iowa. I’m going to South Carolina,” Trump said. “I’m going to New Hampshire. I’ve been invited by everybody.” And he went on: “I don’t know what it is, but I will tell you I do very well in the polls.”","810","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"It wasn’t immediately clear what polls Trump was referring to. But, on Monday, he revealed a cunning campaign strategy, designed to appeal to an important demographic that, hitherto, has been sorely neglected by both major parties: Americans who live near busy airports. Speaking to the Associated Press, Trump said that he is suing Palm Beach County for deliberately directing low-flying planes over his upscale beachfront resort, Mar-a-Lago, whose central building was commissioned by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the nineteen-twenties. “I am saving one of the great houses of this country and one of its greatest landmarks, and it’s being badly damaged by the airplanes,” he said.","811","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"At first glance, appealing to voters concerned about low-flying Boeing 737s might appear to be quixotic. But Trump isn’t as clueless as he sometimes appears to be. As a television celebrity who licenses his name to all sorts of projects, publicity is his lifeblood. Back in 2011, he briefly flirted with launching a Presidential campaign before deciding, quite sensibly, that his role on “The Apprentice” should take priority. Trump also knows that bashing an overweening government is a popular theme among what the G.O.P. activist Grover Norquist calls the “leave us alone coalition.” And Trump even acknowledges, if pressed, that there is a world beyond Palm Beach and the Trump Tower. “The real unemployment rate is twenty per cent,” he said on the New York radio show. “People are suffering out there. And the people that are most suffering are the people that don’t have much money to start out with.”","812","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"After that touching peroration, perhaps Trump could lend some of his wisdom to Romney, who, in many people’s eyes, is still associated with his unseemly, and ultimately devastating, remarks about the shiftless “forty-seven per cent.” If Romney is in deadly earnest about 2016—and an article in Tuesday’s Washington Post said that he is “almost certain” to run—he needs to undergo a serious rebranding exercise.","813","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"As every businessman knows, this is a very tricky proposition, especially when a competitor has already occupied the market niche you aspire to. In this case, the position is that of electable elder. Jeb Bush has all but confirmed that he’s in the race, and has signalled his intention to distance himself from the Tea Party/Rush Limbaugh wing of the party. What role is there for a second G.O.P. moderate who, just twenty-six months ago, in an economic environment that was far more friendly to Republicans than the one they are likely to face in 2016, lost handily to an unpopular President?","814","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"Most political observers believe the answer is none, which makes it hard to fathom Romney’s decision to assemble a new campaign team.","815","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"One possible explanation, proffered by Romney supporters to Chris Cillizza, a blogger at the Washington Post, is that Jeb is far more vulnerable than he appears. Once the media starts chomping on all the lucrative business projects that Bush has been involved with since leaving the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee, this theory goes, his chances of gaining the nomination will fall sharply. (Actually, the chomping has already begun.) And once Bush goes down, there will be an opportunity for Romney or another establishment candidate.","816","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"It’s also conceivable that Romney thinks he has learned from the mistakes he made in 2012, and that he matches up well against Hillary Clinton. (I haven’t seen any public polling that backs this up.) Evidently, he retains the faith in his own managerial abilities that was evident in 2008 and 2012. “There is something in Mitt that drives him to solve problems,” a Romney confidante told Cillizza. “When he sees something is a mess, he doesn’t have it in his DNA to sit back and let someone else just try to clean it up.”","817","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"Of course, it’s possible that Romney’s confidantes and political strategists are encouraging him to run for their own reasons. During the Mittster’s ill-fated 2012 campaign, Vox’s Matt Yglesias reminds us, his seven senior aides all earned more than the highest-paid figure in the Obama campaign. “Romney is surrounded by associates who have every incentive to tell him not just that Barack Obama is a bad president, and that liberal ideas are inferior to conservative ones,” Yglesias notes, “but that he in particular has unique attributes that call him to the stage of national leadership.”","818","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"In view of all this, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Romney hasn’t yet committed to anything. Some commentators think that he will come to his senses and forego another campaign. “He has to, right?” asks New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait. You would think so, but Romney has already been mulling this over for quite a while. The first stories suggesting that he was contemplating a third Presidential campaign appeared in the summer of last year.","819","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/mitt-romney-donald-trump-presidential-runs"
"Perhaps the lesson is that Presidential candidates aren’t like the rest of us. The same qualities of overconfidence, manic ambition, and propensity for risk-taking that enable them to embrace the horrors of a modern campaign also make it hard for them to grasp reality.

"The country is less than convinced. To the extent that a possible Pataki candidacy has been noticed at all, it has been roundly panned. “In politics, you never say never,” the Democratic consultant George Arzt said. “Here, you can say never.” Pataki is not well known outside of his home state, hasn’t held elected office in eight years, and will turn seventy this summer. And yet he seems to be genuinely considering a run. The question, as when Pataki flirted with a bid four years ago, is why. “Pataki—I’m puzzled about this,” Larry J. Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told me. “I don’t even know what he’s been doing. Has he been on corporate boards?”","824","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"The 2016 G.O.P. field is bursting with candidates who have practically no chance of victory. Sabato’s influential Crystal Ball report, which tracks political races across the country, currently counts nineteen potential candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination. Twelve of them have no shot at winning, Sabato said, adding, “and I’m being generous to some of the other seven.” (His generosity does not extend to a perennially rumored candidate whose name is absent from the list. “We couldn’t include Donald Trump and live with ourselves,” he said.)","825","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Sabato’s Crystal Ball has broken down the Republican field into four tiers. At the top are the “Leading Contenders,” who include the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, and the Florida senator Marco Rubio. Sabato estimates that there’s a seventy-five to eighty per cent chance that the nominee will come from that tier. Pataki is one of seven candidates crowded into the “Gadflies and Golden Oldies” tier, at the bottom. He’s joined there by, among others, the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O. Carly Fiorina (“Largely unknown,” the Crystal Ball notes. “No base of support”), the former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore (“Jim who?”), the onetime Maryland governor Bob Ehrlich (“No rationale for candidacy”), and the former United Nations ambassador John Bolton (“No electoral experience or donor base”). “Even if a lot of the people talking about it today don’t wind up running, we could still be looking at a record number of candidates,” Sabato said.","826","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Why are so many experienced people lining up for a race that they cannot possibly win? For some, there’s a genuine call to serve, or a desire to influence the Party’s platform. And, to be sure, the absence of a clear Republican front-runner gives hope to dreamers everywhere. “They start wondering, Maybe I can catch lightening in bottle,” Sabato said. He told me that a candidate in the bottom tier had called him recently and said, “Just wait till I get on that debate stage!”","827","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"For a number of the candidates, however, the chances of actually securing the nomination don’t appear to factor into the decision to run. It is now so easy and so lucrative to mount a campaign for President that, even given the current historically crowded field, it’s a wonder that still more people aren’t running. “The primary process is a spectacle now, and that’s a relatively new development,” Sean McKinley, a Ph.D. student in the politics department at Brandeis University who researches the rewards of unsuccessful campaigns for President, said. “There are increased incentives for people to run, and there are fewer downsides, so why wouldn’t you run?”","828","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"McKinley researched Presidential races between 1976 and 2008, and found that losing candidates benefitted enormously simply from having run. Senators who had only narrowly won earlier elections suddenly found themselves retaining their seats by comfortable margins, despite not having shown well in the Presidential race. For example, in 1970, Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat, won a relatively close Senate race in Texas against the future President George H. W. Bush. Six years later, when Bentsen ran both for President and for reëlection to his Senate seat, he was clobbered by Jimmy Carter in the Presidential primaries but won his Senate seat by fifteen points. He was reëlected to the Senate twice more by comfortable margins, and was Michael Dukakis’s nominee for Vice-President in 1988.","829","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Participating in the public-speaking circuit has emerged as an especially profitable side benefit of running for President. It was reported last year that Hillary Clinton was earning as much as three hundred thousand dollars per appearance at colleges and universities. It’s unlikely, of course, that a middling politician who lacked Clinton’s fame would command such a figure simply for having lost a bid for the White House, but Clinton’s rising tide is widely understood to have lifted all fees. Some of McKinley’s research has focussed on candidates who wound up signing with speaking-engagement agencies after failed runs for President. Gary Bauer, for instance, saw his run, in 2000, as a social-conservative candidate founder after disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire, but he is still available for bookings through the All American Speakers bureau. For many similar candidates, McKinley said, “the only thing they really had on their C.V. was that they had run for President. So if you’re a politician reaching the end of your career, and maybe you haven’t earned as much as you could have in another field, maybe you consider running for President to raise your profile for the speaking tours.”","830","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"That comment brought Pataki to mind, but McKinley points in his research to an even more obscure example: Mike Gravel, a former Democratic senator from Alaska who last served in 1981. After Gravel, who is now eighty-five, announced in 2006 that he would run for President in 2008, he managed to land a book deal. Then, despite a largely ignored campaign, in which he ran first as a Democrat and at the end as a Libertarian, he was able to sign for a time with the Harry Walker Agency, a prestigious speakers’ bureau.","831","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"It would probably be unfair to characterize Gravel’s run for President as having been about personal enrichment. He has spent much of his career working on the issues that motivated his campaign—political empowerment for everyday citizens, the war on drugs, the entanglement of military spending and bellicose foreign policy—but the run did wind up benefitting him financially. These days, he is the president and C.E.O. of a company called KUSH, which plans to produce marijuana-infused products, such as lozenges. “There’s no question that running for President helped me get the job with KUSH,” Gravel told me. “It probably was window dressing to have a Senator and a former candidate for President.” He told me that he doesn’t receive a salary, but did get stock in the company, which is a subsidiary of Cannabis Sativa, Inc., on whose board he also sits. (The C.E.O. of that company, by the way, is Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, who ran for President as a Libertarian in 2012.) “There are people who are much, much beyond their prime of effectiveness who are running for President for the visibility,” Gravel said.","832","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O., appears to be elevating the personal-enrichment campaign strategy to a kind of performance art. She was cited in a poll, released earlier this week, as only two per cent of Republicans’ first choice for President, but will announce her candidacy on May 4th, a day before the release of her new book, “Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey.” “She may win the Newt Gingrich Award for 2016,” Sabato said, and gave Fiorina no chance of actually winning the nomination. “Newt was definitely seeing his book sales go up during his 2012 run—it almost seemed like that was the point of his run, and then he got on a roll and won South Carolina! It was almost by accident.”","833","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Today’s media cycle presents even marginal candidates with endless opportunities to generate headlines that burnish their brands. “There are shades of Marshall McLuhan,” David Michaelson, whose firm, David Michaelson & Company, is a leading authority on the effectiveness of communications and public relations, said. “The medium is the message. Think of a campaign not as a run for office but as an opportunity to tell a story. Think of a campaign as not a campaign but a media platform for your issues or your brand.” And the brand that you’ve built follows you long after you’ve abandoned your campaign. Michaelson cited the example of the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who earned a reputation during his unsuccessful 2008 run as a folksy, conservative truth-teller, an identity that helped him land a talk show on Fox—which he recently left in order to explore a 2016 campaign.","834","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"Underscoring—and underwriting—all of this is the fact that it has never been easier to raise the money required for a run. Changes in campaign-finance laws now allow rich donors to essentially give unlimited amounts of money to support a favored candidate. The former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, for example, ran as a kind of boutique candidate for the Wyoming mutual-fund operator Foster Friess. Though he struggled to raise money elsewhere, Santorum was able to win eleven primaries and caucuses thanks largely to the more than two million dollars in donations he received from Friess. The pair are reportedly considering a second act in 2016.","835","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"“Campaign finance is going to continue to change the shape of politics, as people realize how permissive the laws are,” McKinley said. He expects that we’ll see even more candidates running in future elections. “There are very few rules left. You may have to solicit money from only a couple dozen people.”","836","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"
"What this means in practice is that some candidates who are hoping to last only long enough in the primaries to cash in later on will no longer have to engage in the unpleasant act of begging lots of people for relatively small amounts of money. “You have to be the kind of person who’s willing to do the kinds of things required of a person running for President—kissing babies and asking people for money—that many of us would find distasteful,” McKinley said. “But even those things are getting easier. You don’t even really need to go out and solicit money anymore.”","837","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-value-of-a-fringe-presidential-candidacy"

"Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, explained his approach to the Legislature as we flew in a state plane from Albany to Westchester County. At fifty-seven, Cuomo still has an athletic build, and, at two hundred pounds distributed over a six-foot-one-inch frame, he fits into an airline seat with some difficulty. It was mid-December, and he was on his way to Manhattan to continue a vigil. His father, former Governor Mario Cuomo, was at his apartment on the East Side, with end-stage heart disease. Mario Cuomo defined his three terms as governor with oratory; Andrew Cuomo has sought to build his reputation in a different way. He made clear that his primary inspiration when it came to dealing with legislators was Bill Clinton, not his father. During Clinton’s second term, Cuomo served in his Cabinet, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. “I was watching, and they were impeaching the guy, and he was still there every day, asking them how they were doing, trying to make deals,” Cuomo recalled, his voice bearing the hard consonants of Queens, where he grew up. “My job is to get to yes,” he said. “If I don’t make a deal, I get nothing done. If I get nothing done, I am a failure. If the objective is to make a nice speech, it means nothing.”","864","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Because New York State’s government had long been controlled by “three men in a room”—the Governor; Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Speaker of the Assembly; and Dean Skelos, the Republican Majority Leader of the Senate—Cuomo often found occasion to praise the other two. “I’m very big on giving other people credit,” he told me. “It’s the whole collegial thing. That’s how I get what I get done done.” Most recently, in his State of the State address, on January 21st, Cuomo said that he would soon be going on a trade mission to Mexico, and he displayed a PowerPoint slide of himself, Skelos, and Silver, all wearing sombreros. “We are going to be our own version of the three amigos!” Cuomo declared, to appreciative laughter from Skelos and Silver, who were seated on the stage beside him. A perfunctory shout-out like this would ordinarily draw little notice, except that, the following morning, federal agents led Silver off in handcuffs.","865","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Silver was charged in a baroque scheme to exploit his office for personal gain. According to the prosecutor’s complaint, he arranged for state funding of a research laboratory at Columbia University for victims of an asbestos-related cancer. The director of the lab referred his patients to Silver’s personal-injury law firm, which, in turn, filed lawsuits on their behalf. From this and a related arrangement, Silver is said to have netted more than four million dollars. (Silver has denied wrongdoing, though he did step down as speaker; the lab director and the law firm have not been charged.)","866","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s solicitude for Silver and others in the Legislature was longstanding. In the summer of 2013, Cuomo created what became known as the Moreland Commission, a bipartisan group of leading citizens, who were to spend up to eighteen months investigating public corruption in the state. The commission’s inquiries focussed in particular on whether the outside business activities of state legislators should be subject to tighter regulation. By early 2014, Silver and his colleagues had come to loathe the commission, and went to court to thwart its inquiries. Around the same time, Cuomo was seeking to pass his annual budget, and he hoped to do that on schedule. So, just nine months after Cuomo created the commission, he abruptly shut it down. Silver passed Cuomo’s budget; Cuomo rid Silver of the meddlesome commission.","867","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"On the day after Silver’s arrest, I met with Cuomo in his New York City office, on Third Avenue. I asked him about the widespread contention that the charges against Silver showed that Cuomo should have let the Moreland investigation run its course.","868","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"“They’re exactly wrong,” Cuomo said. “What happened on the Moreland Commission is they subpoenaed the outside info of the Senate and the Assembly, in a fairly aggressive way. The Senate and the Assembly join together, the Republicans and the Democrats, in a motion to quash the subpoenas. And they are successful in the lower court. And we’re stuck for, like, four months.”","869","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Closing down Moreland, in Cuomo’s view, broke the logjam. After the shutdown, the Legislature passed modest ethics reform, which increased penalties for bribery and established a pilot program for public financing in the next state comptroller’s race. Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, demanded the Moreland files and used them to make the case against Silver and, perhaps, others. “We get the legislation I wanted in the first place,” Cuomo told me. “Moreland takes the same cases and the same subpoenas and hands them to local D.A.s and to Preet.” Cuomo disclaims any responsibility for Silver’s possible misdeeds. “If Anthony Weiner shows his private parts, do you blame Obama? These are criminal acts of individual legislators. What would you have me do?”","870","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Each step in Cuomo’s analysis makes a kind of tactical sense. But he shut down the investigation even though the Legislature failed to make significant political reforms. Bharara and the other prosecutors obtained the commission’s files only because Bharara publicly expressed his outrage at Cuomo’s action. * Cuomo’s explanation ignored the symbolism: How could there ever be a legitimate reason, in a state long beset with corruption in its Legislature, for the governor to short-circuit his own marquee attempt to clean it up?","871","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"For better and for worse, Cuomo views his work as a series of transactions. He disdains rhetoric; he prizes results. He has had several accomplishments in his first four years. Against heavy odds, he pushed through a marriage-equality bill in the Legislature; he banned fracking; he tightened the state’s gun-control laws; he closed thirteen prisons; he started construction on the first major bridge in the state in fifty years, a replacement for the Tappan Zee, across the Hudson; and he passed four balanced budgets in a row, all on time. Deeds, not words—that might as well be the motto of Cuomo’s administration. In nearly every speech, and in many conversations, Cuomo dismisses the importance of political talk. As if adopting a typical voter’s view of President Obama, Cuomo told me, “Beautiful rhetoric, beautiful vision—I’m sold on the vision—and what happens? There was no product. There was no actualization of the vision. Now I’m more disillusioned than I was when we started. You brought me up with that beautiful language, and you got me excited and I thought it was possible and then it wasn’t.”","872","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"I mentioned that Cuomo seemed especially pleased to be identified with clearing snow after storms. “Because talking about clearing the snow, talking about doing any of this crap, doesn’t work,” he said. “They’ve heard it before. They’ve heard it all. You’re not going to say anything that moves the jury. I believe that fundamentally. Show me, it’s show-me time. Show me results. Build a bridge, build a train to LaGuardia, clear the snow, save lives. Huh? A little competence. Work with the other side, not this crazy partisan gridlock, huh? You can actually work together. Balance the budget. Really? Get a budget passed on time.” By his own method of accounting, his first term as governor ranks as a considerable success. It also stands in notable counterpoint to that of his father, who died on January 1st, the day Andrew was sworn in for his second term.","873","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"For decades, the political calendar in Albany followed a predictable pattern. The governor gave his State of the State address shortly after the first of the year and submitted a proposed budget by February 1st, in time for the Legislature to act before the current budget expired, on April 1st. When we spoke in his office, Cuomo offered a dramatic rendering of what usually happened next. “All you knew about state government in this state was what you saw for one week a year—four days leading up to April 1st,” he said. “The newscast would start, ‘Well, this year, do you think we’re going to have a budget on time?’ They go to a legislator: ‘I think some people are optimistic. I think it might.’ April 1st: ‘Here we are! Waiting for midnight, let’s see if we have a budget deal. And here the Governor’s coming out. Governor! Are we going to have a budget on time?’ ‘No, the Senate is an ass and the Assembly’s an ass, and they’re all asses.’ The budget winds up four months late, five months late.”","874","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo, who took office in 2011, was determined to end this syndrome. Thanks to a constitutional amendment ratified in 1927, New York State has what’s known as “executive budgeting,” which means, in rough terms, that the governor alone has the right to submit a budget, and the role of the Legislature is limited to voting it up or down. Over the years, though, the power of the Legislature expanded, and the terms of the budget became subject to extensive negotiation and, often, delay. This practice offended James McGuire**, who was chief counsel to Governor George Pataki, the Republican who served from 1995 to 2007, and McGuire led a crusade to restore the governor to preëminence in budget matters. Sheldon Silver challenged McGuire, and Pataki, on behalf of the Assembly. The fight went to the Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, which, in 2004, handed the governor a major victory. The court made clear that the Legislature “may not alter” the governor’s budget proposal in any way.","875","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Still, it took some time for the significance of Silver v. Pataki, as the case was known, to be fully appreciated in Albany. There was only one on-time budget in the Pataki years; the Legislature kept state government functioning after April 1st by passing “extenders”—stopgap measures to fund the operations of the state until the actual budget was passed. “Cuomo was the first one who really used the full extent of the governor’s power over the budget under the constitution,” McGuire told me.","876","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"When Cuomo submitted his first budget, he laid down a challenge to legislators. If they refused to pass his budget on time, he would submit the entire budget as an extender. A Cuomo aide said, “We said to them, ‘Here’s your extender, it’s called the budget. If you don’t want to pass it, you will close the whole government—not just the parks, the whole thing.’ ” The aide went on, “We had to face the question of what we would do if the Legislature didn’t blink. We thought we would have to make good on our threat. But we never got there. They understood that we meant business. They passed the budget, and they did it on time.” Cuomo had tamed the Legislature on the centerpiece of state government.","877","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s obsession with the timing of the budget can obscure the larger issue of state spending. “He fixates on on-time budgets, but he never says why the budgets were delayed in the old days,” Dan Cantor, the national director of the Working Families Party, told me. The Party, a left-leaning consortium of labor unions and others, has had a contentious relationship with Cuomo. “The budgets were delayed because the left held them up, because they wanted more money for things that were important—for schools and roads and libraries. Cuomo is not some kind of progressive. He rejects the view that the middle class in America was built by unions pushing up and the progressive income tax pushing down. His attitude is we have to keep rich people happy. It’s trickle-down economics.”","878","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"To a certain extent, Cuomo would not dispute this view, at least when it comes to taxes. His liberalism manifests itself in initiatives that entail relatively little government spending, such as marriage equality, the fracking ban, and gun control. Cuomo has made a point of cutting some taxes every year, which he regards as crucial in retaining and courting jobs for the state. He also dismisses the idea that the state tax code can address the problem of inequality. “You keep raising taxes, raising regulations, they will leave,” he said in a recent speech in Albany. “Business is more mobile, people are more mobile, and they will leave. And they have left. So that was a cultural shift for us in New York—we’re in a competition with all those other states. Our friends say, ‘Well, we should use the tax code to address social inequities and raise the taxes on the rich.’ If that’s going to happen, that has to happen at the federal level, because we here in this state, we are in a competition, we are in a footrace with every other state. And our taxes and our level of taxation and our regulations are going to say whether we come in first, second, third, or fourth in that race.”","879","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"It’s sometimes said of certain politicians that they love humanity but hate people; Andrew Cuomo does not appear especially fond of either. He is the uncommon elected official with a streak of misanthropy. Cuomo rarely sees ordinary people, and they rarely see him, except in television commercials. “Andrew doesn’t like meeting with voters,” someone who is familiar with his campaigns told me. “He’ll do parades, but that’s about it.” In his 2014 race for reëlection, which he won with fifty-four per cent of the vote, Cuomo outraised Rob Astorino, the Republican candidate, by forty-five million dollars to six million, and thus dominated the airwaves with his advertisements. Cuomo agreed to a single debate with Astorino and none with Zephyr Teachout, his opponent in the Democratic primary.","880","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Except during weather crises or after transportation accidents, Cuomo hardly ever consents to be interviewed on television. When he does answer questions on the air, it is often by telephone rather than on camera. Unlike most of his predecessors, Cuomo has given his inaugural addresses to small, invitation-only audiences. (This year, at the World Trade Center, a guard at the front door shooed away the curious with the words “Not open to the public.”)","881","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo has a tense and distant relationship with the Albany press corps. His news conferences, which are sometimes just “gaggles,” or scrums in a hallway in the capitol, can be contentious. (Reporters have demanded that Cuomo explain the poor sales of his memoir, “All Things Possible,” which was published last fall.) Cuomo does make semi-regular appearances on an Albany-based public-radio interview program, and he used to be a frequent guest on the radio show of Fredric U. Dicker, the longtime Albany correspondent for the New York Post, but the relationship between the two men soured. On the window of Dicker’s office, which faces a well-travelled corridor in the capitol, there is now a photograph of the Governor with a Pinocchio nose and the words “Come clean on Moreland.”","882","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Behind a lectern, Cuomo can sound like an American tourist abroad, speaking loudly and slowly in order to make himself understood. At closer range, he’s a more formidable presence. His speech comes in aggressive, self-confident bursts, especially when he’s sizing up the state of political play. He is relentless. “When he wants to hire you, he starts calling you all the time and acting like you already work for him,” a former aide said. “He just assumes he can persuade you.” His interactions with state legislators also tend to be one on one, and his early success with them on the budget created another opportunity for him. “What people forget is when the budget is months late there is no time to do anything else,” a senior aide told me. “But we knew by March that we were going to get the budget, and that meant that we had time to do marriage equality right away, in 2011.”","883","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Today, same-sex marriage is legal in thirty-six states and the District of Columbia; it would be inconceivable for New York not to be among them. But in 2011 success was a long shot. New York’s Senate had voted down a marriage-equality law two years earlier, when the Democrats controlled the chamber. In the 2010 elections, the Democrats lost the Senate, which meant that getting the issue voted in would be even more difficult. (Passage in the Democratic-controlled Assembly was assured.)","884","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"“I didn’t know that I could pass it,” Cuomo told me. “I’m not a big fan of fighting the good fight and losing, because one of the Democratic Party’s problems is, I think, it’s done that too often. You know, we were oversaturated with good intent, no action, no results.” Still, he decided to press ahead.","885","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The plan was detailed and methodical, focussed entirely on winning in the Senate, which was run, then as now, by the Republican Skelos. “L.B.J. used to talk about how, in legislative relations, people sort of have a pattern,” Cuomo told me. “They talk about, in certain card games, people have a pattern. Clinton used to talk about, you know, people have a tell.” He went on, “Skelos never goes first, and Skelos never says anything until the last minute.” At first, Skelos would not even commit himself to bringing the issue up for a vote. As Cuomo recalled, “Skelos said, as a put-off, ‘Don’t ask me what I’m going to do. You never get to me until it gets past the Democrats, and it hasn’t gotten past the Democrats. So I’m not responding, because it’s moot. Call me when it gets past the Democrats. And, by the way, it never will.’ ” (Skelos declined to comment.)","886","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo and his allies tried to establish Democratic unity, which proved elusive. In the cynical calculus of Albany, failure on marriage equality looked better to some Democrats than victory. “If they kept the issue alive, year after year, they could continue to fund-raise against Republicans on it, and then blame the Republicans for its failure,” one person involved in the process said. Cuomo personally lobbied the holdouts. His staff kept a stash of Pepperidge Farm cookies (as well as Kosher cookies for the observant) for when the lawmakers came to meet with him. “All governors—Pataki, Spitzer, his father, me—let the legislators get on our nerves,” David Paterson, Cuomo’s predecessor, told me. “Andrew maintains a poise of not letting that get into the conversation. Many would have thought that his temper and his passion would get in the way. He has actually been the governor who has exercised greater patience and decorum than the rest of us.” When Cuomo grew frustrated by a few stalling Democrats, he called a press conference to demonstrate that all members of the Party were now united. Unwilling to embarrass the Governor, everyone fell in line.","887","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"He then needed at least three Republican votes, a task made considerably more difficult by a public promise from the leader of the state Conservative Party to mount primary challenges against any Republican senators who voted for same-sex marriage. “It was just good old-fashioned political personal persuasion,” a Cuomo aide recalled. The marriage bill was the last bill of the session, and Cuomo had few options for horse-trading about other legislation. “He used the governor’s mansion. He used his office. His daughters were around. You were greeted. You were given refreshments. You were talking with Andrew, your friend, alone. ‘Which side of history do you want to be on?’ ‘I won’t forget you.’ ‘Have another cookie.’ ”","888","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Roy McDonald, a longtime Republican state senator from a district around Saratoga County, had voted against marriage equality in 2009. “I think with some of these social issues, it becomes so adversarial that it hurts our country,” he told me. “But I began to think, If someone is pursuing happiness, God bless them. It’s not our business to be telling people what to do.” Cuomo met with McDonald repeatedly. “He talked to me, but I don’t think it was a matter of convincing us,” McDonald said. “He was respectful. I commended him for being a leader on the issue.” In time, Cuomo gathered four Republican commitments for his side. (Four was ultimately deemed necessary, because no one wanted to be “the vote” that turned the issue.)","889","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Marriage equality passed by thirty-three to twenty-nine. In 2012, Roy McDonald was defeated for reëlection in the Republican primary.","890","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s contempt for the power of words alone seems especially notable coming from the son of perhaps the best-known political speaker of his generation. He often uses the same phrase to dismiss comparisons between him and his father. As he put it in his eulogy for Mario, “Over the years, the press would love to give their dime-store psychoanalysis of our quote-unquote ‘complex’ father-and-son relationship, which was all a lot of hooey.” Still, the relationship was complex, and, like most sons, Andrew was formed both by emulation and by rejection of his father’s example.","891","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"During Andrew’s childhood, his father was not a famous man. For most of those years, Mario Cuomo was a work-obsessed lawyer with a modest practice in downtown Brooklyn. He first came to some prominence in 1972, when Mayor John Lindsay asked him to mediate a dispute in Queens. The Lindsay administration had proposed building a large public-housing project in Forest Hills, which was then a mainly Jewish and middle-class neighborhood. The community rebelled, and the fight, which pitted African-Americans against Jews, became both a symptom and a cause of the breakdown of the civil-rights coalition of the nineteen-sixties. Cuomo brokered a compromise (the project was built in a scaled-back form), and he then published a thoughtful diary of his efforts to resolve the controversy. Readers of the diary, which recounted his seven-day work weeks, could be forgiven for concluding that the author had no children. In fact, he had five.","892","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Mario and Matilda Cuomo married in 1954, while Mario was a student at St. John’s law school, and they had their first child, Margaret, the following year. She is now a prominent radiologist and cancer specialist. Andrew was born in 1957. In a later edition of Mario’s diaries, he wrote, “Margaret and Andrew Mark took the brunt of the early years of our marriage, years of financial insecurity when I was a law student and young lawyer, and Matilda taught school.” The next child was Maria, a philanthropist married to the designer Kenneth Cole; then Madeline, a lawyer; and, finally, Chris, born in 1970, who is a news anchor at CNN, where we are colleagues. Andrew Cuomo notes in his memoir that protesters in the Forest Hills controversy sometimes came to the Cuomo family home, in Queens, but they wasted their time: “He often left before my sisters and I got up and came back after we were asleep. To make their point, the demonstrators would have had to march at 7 P.M. on a Sunday, the one time of the week that my mother insisted he be home for dinner. And when he was home, he was usually working.”","893","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Andrew went to Archbishop Molloy*** High School, in Queens, and, the week before he graduated, his father’s close friend Fabian Palomino asked Mario how Andrew was doing. “You know, I really don’t know,” Mario replied, as recounted in Robert S. McElvaine’s 1988 biography. “I’ve been so busy running around the office for a long time—I really don’t know. I haven’t spent a lot of time with him in the last four years. I guess I’ve taken him to two or three ball games. Matilda made me take him.”","894","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After the mediation in Forest Hills, Cuomo became a more or less perpetual candidate for elective office, usually an unsuccessful one. In 1973, he considered a run for mayor of New York, but backed out. In 1974, he lost the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor; the following year, the new governor, Hugh Carey, named him secretary of state. In 1977, Cuomo entered a seven-way Democratic primary for mayor of New York, a contest that remains a classic in New York politics. As Andrew writes in his book, “I learned early that if I wanted to spend time with my father I had to tag along.”","895","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"So Andrew, then in his second year at Fordham, in the Bronx, volunteered to be Mario’s driver in the mayor’s race. “Andrew was the ‘body guy’—he was always with his father,” Bruce Gyory, an Albany-based political consultant who worked on the campaign, told me. “His job was to get his father in and out of events on time. It was not easy, because Mario was warm and gregarious, and he didn’t have that inner clock that most politicians have about when their next meeting is.” In the fall, Andrew returned to college, and organized the borough for his father. Mario finished second to Ed Koch in the primary, lost to him in a runoff, and then ran unsuccessfully as the Liberal Party candidate in the general election. (The race poisoned relations between Mario Cuomo and Koch for the rest of their lives, mainly because Koch blamed Cuomo for campaign signs that supposedly said “Vote for Cuomo, not the homo.” Over the years, Andrew has also been blamed for the signs. Though the signs figure largely in New York political folklore, there is no evidence that they even existed.)","896","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The following year, 1978, Mario ran as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor—a largely powerless position—and won. Andrew was then a student at Albany Law School, and while the Legislature was in session he and Mario were roommates at the Hotel Wellington. Mario kept a diary during this period, and Andrew is a frequent presence, usually as the object of his father’s affectionate exasperation. December 6, 1980: “Andrew is looking for another car: he has a real fascination with automobiles that comes higher on his list of priorities than many other things, including studying for his classes. He’ll pass anyway; he always has. But he has never tested himself intellectually. I think if he did he’d be surprised at his own ability.” (Andrew still collects and tinkers with sports cars.) January 22, 1981: “Andrew is working at the gas station for the week he’s home. He’s going to need the money. He ran up $165 in tickets in Albany for leaving his car parked overtime while he was studying for exams. The car is in his mother’s name, so they ran a story in the Times-Union referring to Matilda Cuomo, scofflaw!”","897","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In 1982, Cuomo and Koch ran against each other again, this time in the Democratic primary for governor. The race was widely seen as a last chance for Cuomo, who was earning a reputation as a perennial loser. In his diary, on January 5, 1982, he noted that a political associate “suggested Andrew would make a good campaign manager. . . . I’m leery about his being too distracted from his law studies, though, and will have to think hard about it.”","898","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"It appears, in retrospect, that Mario praised his son more in his diary than to his face. “As our conversations began to center on the upcoming 1982 election, my father never mentioned that he had any particular confidence in my political acumen,” Andrew wrote in his memoir. “Expressing feelings and pride in their children was not something the men of his generation did.” Still, at this moment of political life or death, Mario turned to his son. February 18, 1982: “Andrew is doing an excellent job organizing the campaign. He, more than any of us, has appeared to profit from the political involvement of the last 8 years. He is competent, respectful, dedicated—and liked.”","899","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"That last point was debatable. During 1982, Andrew first gained a reputation as a political brawler, playing the bad cop to his father’s philosopher king. Koch began the campaign with a thirty-five-per-cent lead in the polls, and Mario, as well as his twenty-four-year-old campaign manager, had to struggle to be taken seriously. “Andrew is driven and intense, and he was smarter than people gave him credit for when he was running his father’s campaign,” Howard Glaser, who worked for Mario in 1982 and has since been a close aide to Andrew, told me. “He’s never been a person who cared a lot about what the media thinks of him. He just wanted to get the job done.” Aided by a series of gaffes by Koch, including a Playboy interview in which the Mayor disparaged both rural and suburban life, Mario surged to a six-point victory in the primary. September 23, 1982: “Andrew is near exhaustion. He has a tendency to overwork himself. It’s a syndrome I recognize and understand.” In the general election, Mario defeated Lew Lehrman, a corporate executive who lavishly financed his own campaign, by three per cent. December 5, 1982: “Andrew loved the beautiful gold pocket watch his family bought him for his 25th birthday. Engraved on the inside of the front cover was the inscription: ‘We are proud of you. Even more, we love you. Your family.’ It was wonderful to be able to do it.”","900","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the state capitol in Albany, Andrew Cuomo sits at the same desk, in the same office, that his father did as governor. George Pataki used a grand space next door, but Andrew, like his father, prefers the cozier dimensions of Room 203. On a shelf opposite the desk is a photograph of the two men together, taken on a basketball court, shortly after Mario was elected governor. Though they are both smiling for the photographer, they also clearly know how to play the game—and are intent on the competition. Andrew, his hair styled in a swirling eighties bouffant, is dribbling, while his father leans in on defense. “I weigh two hundred, but he was two forty,” Andrew told me. “If he knocked into you, you hurt for a week.”","901","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Basketball is a team game. Mario preferred to play one on one, as Andrew recalled at his father’s funeral. “The basketball court remained for him the one place where he could allow himself to be his fully aggressive self,” Andrew said. “We had epic battles, he and I. He hated few things as much as a timid opponent on the basketball court, because you cheated him of a real contest. I was bigger than my father, and I was not intimidated by the fact that he was governor—he couldn’t fire me. We played in the state-police gym in Albany. He liked to play one on one because it was the purest form of competition. . . . He would make faces at you, he would taunt you, he would talk constantly, and it would distract me—a maddening banter, designed to unnerve you. He would hit you in places the human body did not have anatomical defenses.”","902","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The two men usually played ball at the end of long days in Albany, where Andrew worked for his father as an unpaid adviser. (The other aides called him Governor; Andrew called him Mario.) As Andrew notes in his memoir, it was around this time that he earned the nicknames “Prince of Darkness,” “Darth Vader,” and Mario’s “hatchet man.” (All undeserved, Andrew said.) In short order, though, Andrew escaped Albany, spending a brief period as an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan and then as a lawyer in a private firm. He retained a hand in his father’s political career, but soon went out on his own.","903","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the eighties, New York City, and the state as a whole, suffered an epidemic of homelessness. Many of the homeless had no shelter; others lived in shabby and dangerous hotels that charged the government exorbitant rates. Cuomo decided to help address the problem by establishing a nonprofit organization called Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, or HELP. The plan was to build transitional housing for the homeless and provide social services to the residents on site. The idea was also to provide a kind of tough love for the residents. In return for housing and assistance, including job training and day care, the residents had to observe a strict code of conduct, which set a 10 P.M. curfew. Cuomo built a successful demonstration project in the East New York section of Brooklyn.","904","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s next project for HELP proved more difficult. He sought to build a development for the homeless in Greenburgh, a town of eighty-five thousand in suburban Westchester County. The locals objected to housing for the poor in their midst, and Andrew found himself in an ugly fight reminiscent of Mario’s struggle in Forest Hills, nearly two decades earlier. He got some idea of what he was up against when he brought two dozen doughnuts to what he thought would be a small community meeting about the project, and seven hundred people showed up. Still, he approached the controversy much as his father had—with long neighborhood consultations, quiet negotiations, and scaled-back ambitions. It took four years, five lawsuits, and ten million dollars, but finally, in 1991, HELP opened its Greenburgh complex. (HELP still exists, with Maria Cuomo Cole as the board chair, and it has established thirty-two residential facilities for the homeless.)","905","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the meantime, Andrew began courting Kerry Kennedy, one of Robert F. Kennedy’s eleven children, who was working in Boston on a foundation dedicated to her father’s memory. In his book, Andrew describes his first visit to the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod. “I was dressed all wrong,” he writes. “These people were wearing cut-off denim shorts, ragged T-shirts, and no shoes. I looked like a designer logo smorgasbord. Not to mention the baggy psychedelic bathing suit and loafers. This was Saturday Night Fever meets Hyannis Port.” Andrew Cuomo and Kerry Kennedy married on June 9, 1990.","906","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After Bill Clinton was elected President, in 1992, his team recruited Andrew, by then a nationally recognized expert on housing, to become an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. While in Washington, the Cuomos had twin girls and then another daughter. In 1994, when Mario Cuomo ran for a fourth term in New York, Andrew did not return to help him campaign. It was the first time he had not participated in one of his father’s races. Mario was swept out in the Republican landslides of that year by Pataki, an unheralded state senator. Andrew’s career continued to advance. Two years later, when Clinton was reëlected, he named Cuomo to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development. At thirty-nine, Cuomo was the youngest member of any President’s Cabinet since John F. Kennedy made Robert Kennedy the Attorney General, in 1961.","907","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"As the HUD Secretary, Cuomo presented himself as the spokesman for the nation’s poor, travelling around the country to show that, even in a time of prosperity, many people were left behind. He was given to fierce denunciations of those who, in his opinion, used federal dollars to mistreat the vulnerable. In 1997, the department sued A. Bruce Rozet, a HUD landlord, accusing him of taking kickbacks from a management company called Insignia Financial, which ran his buildings. According to a press release from HUD, which was cited in a 2006 Village Voice story, the department’s mission was to provide housing for the needy—“not to provide lives of luxury for con artists stealing from our programs.” Cuomo called the case “the largest ever brought by HUD” and condemned “the abysmal conditions” that he said tenants were forced to endure in projects that had been “poorly maintained” by Insignia.","908","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the period leading up to the 2000 Presidential campaign, Cuomo had grown close to Vice-President Al Gore, and he was mentioned as a possible White House chief of staff in a Gore Administration. But, with George W. Bush’s Inauguration, Cuomo returned to New York. And his life fell apart.","909","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo had not lived in New York State for eight years, but he had a famous father (and famous in-laws), along with an impressive résumé from his federal service, and in 2002 he decided to run for the Democratic nomination for governor. His opponent was Carl McCall, the state treasurer and a veteran of New York politics, who had been waiting his turn for a shot at the top job. McCall was also the highest-ranking African-American official in the state. The rationale for Cuomo’s candidacy, which he declared in a Kenneth Cole showroom, was never clear. Cuomo tried to portray himself as an insurgent outsider, but that was a tough sell from a governor’s son and veteran political operative. On April 17, 2002, Cuomo committed what was regarded as a fatal gaffe. Comparing the incumbent, Pataki, to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the aftermath of 9/11, Cuomo said, “He stood behind the leader. He held the leader’s coat.” This was regarded as an unforgivable politicization of the terrorist attacks. The governor’s race went so badly that Cuomo was compelled to withdraw even before the primary. (In the general campaign, McCall lost handily to Pataki.)","910","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After the election, Cuomo’s marriage disintegrated, in a rancorous battle chronicled in detail by the local tabloids. The divorce was eventually settled, without litigation, but Cuomo found himself an outcast—single, unemployed, and repudiated by the New York political establishment. His salvation began in an unlikely place. He was visiting a real-estate executive in New York, and another prominent businessman happened to be in the office—Andrew Farkas, who had been the chief executive of Insignia Financial, the company that Cuomo denounced in such strong terms as HUD Secretary.","911","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Farkas, an heir to the Alexander’s department-store fortune, who went on to make one of his own, was spoiling for a fight with his former adversary. Farkas’s company had paid more than seven million dollars to settle the charges in the HUD case. (Farkas was never personally charged.) “Our first interaction was somewhat combative,” Farkas told me. “We had a very difficult few hours together, then we went back to our respective corners.” Still, Cuomo got in touch to continue their conversation. “I was intrigued with the fortitude of a man who was walking into the hornet’s nest of dealing with me,” Farkas said. “Folklore and myth and legend are full of stories of people who meet on the field and go from combatants to allies. We became quite enamored of each other. We had a great deal in common—families with strong fathers, and we both had our problems with prior marriages.”","912","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo went to work for a new commercial real-estate venture that Farkas established, and, as the Times has reported, he was paid more than $2.5 million in three years. Also in this period, as Cuomo notes in his memoir, he remained an attentive parent to his daughters, in spite of the divorce—a point of great pride with him. (The twins are now in college, and the younger daughter will go next fall.) Cuomo also began seeing Sandra Lee, a food and life-style entrepreneur. They have lived together in Westchester for years. “We are not married, and everything is fine,” Cuomo told me. Lee has eschewed the role of First Lady, and continued a successful independent career.","913","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"When, in 2006, Pataki decided not to seek a fourth term, Eliot Spitzer, who had enjoyed great success as the state attorney general, had a clear shot at the governorship. Cuomo decided to run for attorney general. The finance chairman of his campaign was Andrew Farkas.","914","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo had learned from his 2002 defeat. Gone were the announcement parties at fashionable New York locales, replaced by humble entreaties to mid-level upstate pols. At the time, David Paterson was Spitzer’s running mate. Paterson told me, “I told him that I thought he should go around and visit some of the people in New York state politics, in a kind of mea-culpa kind of way. That doesn’t come naturally to Andrew, to say the least, but he did do it.” Notably, Cuomo did not seek the advice of his father on campaign matters. Campaign advisers tell of receiving phone calls from Mario Cuomo, who would report that Andrew wasn’t interested in his advice. Andrew, in turn, would ask the staffers what Mario was saying. Cuomo won the primary and the general election with ease.","915","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo and Spitzer, two ambitious New York politicians of the same generation and party, had eyed each other warily for years. Cuomo now had to figure out how to define himself in an office where Spitzer had become known nationally, as the scourge of Wall Street. His approach was different. “As lawyers, we are very interested in process,” a senior member of Cuomo’s staff in the attorney general’s office said. “But Andrew is not very interested in process. He didn’t care that much about how we put cases together and how we planned to litigate. He wanted, instead, to know what were we going to end with, and what’s the best way to get there.” According to Mylan Denerstein, another top aide in both the attorney general’s and the governor’s office, “He is fixated on accomplishments and results. He’d always walk around the office saying he wanted to hear ‘-ed’ words from his staff—‘completed,’ ‘filed,’ ‘accomplished’—not ‘-ing’ words—‘trying,’ ‘working,’ ‘hoping.’ ” In line with these priorities, Cuomo, as attorney general, succeeded more frequently in negotiating settlements in major investigations than in filing long-shot lawsuits. He obtained a major reform of student-loan practices from eight leading lenders and won an agreement for pharmacies to give prescription information in languages besides English. Since attorneys general can pick and choose among issues to pursue, and the public has few expectations for them, the job carries few political risks, and has been a common stepping stone to the governorship.","916","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo found ways to afflict Spitzer. After news broke that Joseph Bruno, then the Republican leader in the Senate, might have used state aircraft for personal purposes, Cuomo launched an investigation. He cleared Bruno of wrongdoing but excoriated Spitzer for using the controversy to gain political advantage over Bruno. And when Spitzer’s reputation imploded, in a prostitution scandal, forcing him to resign after little more than a year, Cuomo was one step closer to the top position. David Paterson, thrust suddenly into the top job, fared little better than Spitzer—again, without much help from Cuomo. Paterson was accused of covering for an aide accused of domestic violence and, in a separate matter, accepting free Yankees tickets. As the state’s chief law-enforcement officer, Cuomo might have offered a lifeline to the newly installed governor, but he let Paterson suffer. Amid chaos in Albany, and a fast-sinking national economy, Paterson decided against running for his own term as governor in 2010. Cuomo ran, and won by a wide margin.","917","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The design of the New York State Capitol, which was completed on the crest of an Albany hillside in 1899, borrows from most of the leading architectural styles of the previous millennia, none entirely successfully. But Andrew Cuomo loves the building in all its Romanesque-Gothic-neoclassical-Victorian glory. He’s been a regular in its corridors since his father became secretary of state, nearly four decades ago. Upon taking the governor’s office, in 2011, Cuomo insisted that a renovation, which had been creeping along for eleven years, be completed within a year. “The place smelled like a New York subway in the seventies,” he told me. “It was intolerable.”","918","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In 1995, George Pataki cut off public access to the corridors of the second floor of the capitol, where he and his staff worked. Cuomo reopened the space to the public and supervised a renovation of what’s known as the Hall of Governors. There are portraits of Cuomo’s predecessors (except Spitzer), cabinets of mementos from their tenures, and, stencilled on the walls, a time line of significant events in New York history. To wander that hallway is to recognize that for much of American history the governorship of New York served as a kind of proto Vice-Presidency, carrying with it the expectation of a run for the White House. Some governors won (Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Roosevelt), some lost (Charles Evans Hughes, Al Smith, Thomas E. Dewey, Nelson Rockefeller), and some went on to other forms of distinguished service (John Jay, Herbert Lehman, Averell Harriman). With a few exceptions, they were consequential men. (They have all been men.)","919","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In the cabinet devoted to Mario Cuomo’s twelve years, there are three printed items: a 1988 message from Cuomo to the Legislature announcing the “Decade of the Child”; the first of Cuomo’s twelve vetoes of the reinstitution of the death penalty in New York; and a book of his speeches, which is open to a 1984 address at Notre Dame, in which he described his effort to reconcile his Catholic faith with his support for abortion rights. These are honorable achievements, but modest in scope. Mario was somewhat defensive about a legacy defined more by talk than by action; he called his book of speeches, with some exaggeration, “More Than Words.” Through the sleepy Pataki years, and the brief, chaotic reigns of Spitzer and Paterson, there are few landmarks noted in the Hall of Governors. There is already one for Andrew Cuomo, however: “2011: New York grants marriage equality for all citizens.”","920","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After the same-sex-marriage victory, Cuomo became a hero in the gay community, and he was invited to be honored at the annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, in Washington. His only obligation would have been an eight-minute speech, and the event presented a priceless opportunity for a politician with national ambitions to meet with some of the most important Democratic fund-raisers in the country. Cuomo declined.","921","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"“Maybe I’ve overdone it, but that Presidential phenomenon got my father into a lot of trouble,” Cuomo told me. (Mario Cuomo vacillated about running for President, especially in the 1992 cycle.) “There’s only one good way to deal with it: ‘I’m running for President, I’m telling you now, before you ask, that I’m running. Goodbye.’ ” He went on, “The protracted expectation, the flirtation, is very harmful, because fundamentally what I have is my relationship with the people in the state. And they’re suspicious of my ego and my ambition. And as soon as you put in their head, ‘Maybe he wants to be President and that’s why he’s doing this, to be President,’ I believe your whole relationship changes.” Speaking of the press, he said, “I have bent over backward not to give them anything, because that’s what they want to write.”","922","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"The question of Cuomo’s ambition for the White House is largely moot for 2016, because Hillary Clinton, also a New Yorker (of sorts), is the presumed Democratic nominee. Cuomo has not officially taken himself out of the running, and he is stepping up his international travel, including a forthcoming trip to Cuba, but there is no Cuomo campaign operation, and there probably will not be one during this cycle. (A new biography of Cuomo, by Michael Shnayerson, will be published in March; the book is premised on a possible race for the White House.) Still, even among Cuomo’s friends and advisers there seems to be little enthusiasm for a Presidential run. The Governor’s reclusive public profile, many agree, makes him ill-suited to running for national office. “Andrew will not run for President,” a former aide told me. “He’d have to talk to too many people.”","923","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Silver’s arrest has already scrambled Cuomo’s plans for his second term. Political corruption in Albany has proved to be varied, as well as enduring; in recent years, legislators have been accused of taking bribes and kickbacks, and engaging in sexual harassment and assault, as well as, like Silver, exploiting their office in connection with outside earnings. Cuomo gave a speech last week promising (again) to tighten rules on legislators’ outside activities, but the culture of the capitol is notoriously resistant to change. Otherwise, Cuomo plans a strong push to remove failing public-school teachers, a move that is opposed by unions (and their allies in the Working Families Party). Cuomo will look for opportunities where he can find them. “I don’t operate in a vacuum,” he told me. “I deal one year at a time, in reaction to the times.”","924","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Cuomo’s transactional approach extends not only to issues but also to individuals; he tends to have nonaggression pacts rather than alliances. As HUD Secretary, Cuomo hired Bill de Blasio to be his New York representative, and, now that de Blasio is the mayor of New York City, the Governor appears determined to remind him of his continuing junior status. When the two men differed over charter schools (Cuomo is an enthusiastic backer, de Blasio is more skeptical), the Governor supported a multi-million-dollar television campaign against the Mayor’s position. Cuomo and Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, jointly control the Port Authority, which operates the bridges, tunnels, and airports of the New York metropolitan area. Cuomo refrained from attacking Christie during the scandal involving the closure of an approach to the George Washington Bridge; Christie, although he was chair of the Republican Governors’ Association, did not campaign for Cuomo’s opponent or offer him financial support. As part of a deal to obtain the endorsement of the Working Families Party last year, Cuomo promised to campaign for Democrats to take control of the Senate; he did almost nothing to that end. “It’s clear that Cuomo doesn’t really want a Democratic Senate,” Zephyr Teachout, his primary opponent, said. “He’d rather be the power broker between the two houses rather than see actual progressive legislation passed.”","925","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"In light of his father’s illness, Cuomo’s celebration of his reëlection was muted, his attention sometimes distracted. One day in December, at a gaggle outside his office in the capitol, a reporter asked him a question about raising tolls on the Thruway. Cuomo dodged, saying that some people thought the rates should rise, and some people thought otherwise. A reporter in the back of the scrum yelled out, “But what does Governor Cuomo think?”","926","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"

"As Mario Cuomo’s life slipped away in the final days of 2014, his elder son was a frequent presence by his side. “He’d sleep for, like, twenty minutes and he’d be up, and this was the constant cycle,” Andrew told me. “So it actually worked, because I could go at five in the morning or I could go at two in the morning, but I was going every morning and every night.” Andrew wanted his father to be healthy enough to hold the Bible at his swearing-in, on New Year’s Day. “I said to him, ‘You have to exercise your upper body, because you have to hold the Bible. You have to hold the Bible.’ ” As father and son talked, Mario had a question: Which version of the Bible?","928","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Mario Cuomo was the rare politician who might actually have an informed preference on Biblical liturgy. “We used to argue about the versions of the Bible,” Andrew said. “We spent a lot of time separating the findings of the management of the Church from Jesus’ teachings. So what Bible we’re talking about was important, because some Bibles are more interpretive, some are purer. He wanted the more verbatim, from Jesus. Because that was his whole point—that he had issues with the management of the Church, but he had no issue with the owner of the franchise.” They settled on the King James.","929","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"Andrew planned two inauguration ceremonies on New Year’s Day—the one at the World Trade Center, and the other in Buffalo. As the day drew near, Mario confessed that he was too weak to hold the Bible. Andrew recalled, “New Year’s morning—I’m on the way to the inauguration, and I stop by, I thought I’d take one more chance—I said, ‘Come on.’ I said, ‘Let’s go. You don’t have to hold the Bible, but why don’t you come?’ And he said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘I told you I can’t go. But I’ll be right here.’ ” So Andrew made him an offer. If Mario felt up to it, Andrew would take him along to Buffalo: “And he loved Buffalo, my father. Buffalo was probably the worst-off part of the state for a lot of years. And the Buffalo Bills were always an underdog, so he was very drawn to Buffalo, as am I.” Mario watched the World Trade Center speech on television, with Andrew’s sisters, but he didn’t say anything about going to Buffalo, so Andrew went on without him.","930","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/albany-chronicles"
"After Andrew gave the second version of his inaugural address, in Buffalo, in the late afternoon, he stepped down to greet guests at the ceremony. “It’s a small room, you came off the stage, I had just gotten sworn in, I had to shake hands,” Andrew recalled.

The latest example came at an event in New York this week for Wisconsin governor Scott Walker’s nascent Presidential campaign. “I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America,” Giuliani said during the dinner at the “21” Club, according to Politico. “He doesn’t love you.

"At one level, one could see Giuliani’s statements as simply incorrect. Obama does love America; he does work hard for his country; he did not say everybody should hate the police. But Giuliani’s attacks on the President are not principally meant as assertions of fact. They are meant to tap into a deep wellspring of American political thought, one defined by the Columbia historian Richard Hofstadter five decades ago. In an article in Harper’s, Hofstadter described “the paranoid style in American politics,” which he said was characterized by “heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy.” Looking back, Hofstadter pointed to the anti-Masonic movement and the nativist and anti-Catholic movement as examples, but he also ascribed the paranoid style to his own era.

"With his cosmopolitan background, Obama makes an especially tempting target for the paranoid style. He is so easy to portray as foreign, as other, as an emissary from alien civilizations who has managed to insinuate himself into the center of American power. It’s difficult to imagine Giuliani applying the same kind of insults to, say, Hillary Clinton. (She gets others.) Obama is now in the autumn of his Presidency, and the particular venom he attracts from his critics will fade along with his powers. But the motivation behind the epithets from Giuliani and his allies will endure, and the resentments will find a new target, sooner rather than later.","945","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paranoid-style-rudy-giuliani"

"Set aside, for a moment, his repeated refusal, in the past few days, to say whether he believes that President Obama loves America, or whether he believes that the President is a Christian, and look instead at Walker’s record running what used to be one of America’s more progressive states. Having cut taxes for the wealthy and stripped many of Wisconsin’s public-sector unions of their collective-bargaining rights, he is now preparing to sign a legislative bill that would cripple unions in the private sector. Many wealthy conservatives, such as the Koch brothers, who have funnelled a lot of money to groups supporting Walker, regard him as someone who’s turning his state into a showcase for what they want the rest of America to look like.","947","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"But just how threatening is he? If you’ve been following the political news during the past week, you may well have the impression that he’s stumbling in his campaign for the 2016 G.O.P. nomination. Among the political commentariat, the consensus of opinion is that Walker’s repeated refusal to distance himself from Rudy Giuliani’s incendiary comments about Obama, and his subsequent encounter with the Washington Post’s Dan Balz and Robert Costa, during which he appeared to question Obama’s religious faith and took some shots at the media for asking him silly questions, weren’t merely reprehensible: they were serious gaffes that raised questions about Walker’s political abilities.","948","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It wasn’t just liberal columnists who piled on. In a column at the Daily Beast, Matt Lewis, who also writes for the Daily Caller, said that Walker’s comments raised the question of whether he “might not be ready for prime time on the national stage.” Lewis went on: “Conservatives should be worried that Walker hasn’t proven capable of navigating these land mines.” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who is a former G.O.P. congressman, wrote at Politico: “Good candidates know how to make dumb questions look, well, dumb.”","949","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Rather than deflecting the reporters’ queries about Obama’s beliefs, as other Republicans had done, Walker used them to send a none-too-subtle message to Republican voters. His refusal to say whether Obama was a Christian wasn’t merely a shot at a hostile media. As Dana Milbank, of the Washington Post noted, it allowed Walker to “wink and nod at the far-right fringe where people really believe that Obama is a Muslim from Kenya who hates America.” Milbank also wrote that Walker was “refusing to grant his opponent legitimacy as an American and a Christian.”","950","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"In a more just world, Walker’s indecent and craven antics would disqualify him from playing any further role in the Presidential race.

"Having cemented his reputation as an economic conservative, Walker is busy making a concerted effort to win over social conservatives and evangelical Christians, some of whom apparently believe that Obama is the Antichrist (or perhaps the Seventh King). Earlier this month, during a trip to London, he refused to say whether he believed in evolution, commenting: “That’s a question a politician shouldn’t be involved in, one way or the other.” In addition to making that hat tip to the Book of Genesis brigade, Walker has been reiterating his opposition to gay marriage and taking a notably harder line on abortion than he did during his gubernatorial reëlection campaign, last year. In a recent meeting with Iowa Republicans, the Times reported earlier this week, he stressed his support for a “personhood amendment” that would define life as beginning at conception and effectively outlaw the termination of pregnancies.","952","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"Evaluated in this context, Walker’s comments, or refusals to comment, about Obama’s beliefs look less like gaffes and more like carefully considered elements of a larger plan—and one that’s working for him. On Tuesday, the research firm Public Policy Polling released the results of a new national survey of Republican voters, which showed Walker leading the G.O.P. race, with twenty-five per cent of the vote. He was seven percentage points ahead of the candidate in second place, Ben Carson, the author and neurosurgeon, and eight percentage points ahead of Jeb Bush. “Walker is climbing fast in the polling because of his appeal to the most conservative elements of the Republican electorate,” said P.P.P. “Among ‘very conservative’ voters he leads with 37% to 19% for Carson, 12% for Bush, and 11% for Huckabee.”","953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"This is just one poll, and the sample size was small—three hundred and sixteen—but recent state-level polls also show Walker near or in the lead. In California, according to the highly respected Field poll, he’s favored by eighteen per cent of Republicans. Bush is in second place with sixteen per cent, and Rand Paul is in third place with ten per cent. In Texas, a survey carried out by the University of Texas at Austin shows Walker running second, but he’s trailing local boy Ted Cruz by just one percentage point. When a previous poll was taken, in October, only two per cent of Texan Republicans favored Walker; now, he’s standing at nineteen per cent. In South Carolina, according to another P.P.P. survey, he’s also running second, just one point behind Bush, and leading Lindsey Graham, the state’s senior representative in the U.S. Senate.","954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"
"It’s still early, very early, of course. But Walker is an ambitious and determined politician who has already been through one tough race—his 2012 recall election—that subjected him to a great deal of media attention and hostility from Democrats. Thanks to his ties to the conservative plutocracy, he’s almost certainly going to have some serious money behind him, and he is trying to pitch his campaign in the sweet spot of G.O.P. primaries, where conservatism and antagonism toward coastal élites meets electability. He has the advantage of youthfulness, at age forty-seven, and, finally, as he pointed out to a convention of Christian broadcasters on Monday, he is, “unlike some out there,” a self-made fellow who “didn’t inherit fame or fortune from my family.” That jab was presumably aimed at Jeb Bush, but if Walker were to get the G.O.P. nomination, it could be modified and directed at Hillary Clinton, assuming that she wins the Democratic nomination.","955","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker"

"There are two new signs that the Republican Party, often said to be in the midst of a civil war, might be experiencing something more like the Internet bubble of the nineteen-nineties. First, there’s the money: at a conference this weekend organized by Freedom Partners, a network built around the Koch brothers, donors met in Rancho Mirage, California, and resolved to spend eight hundred and eighty-nine million dollars—the sort of number that gets rounded up to a billion—on the G.O.P.’s 2016 candidates, according to the Washington Post’s Matea Gold.","January 27, 2015","957","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"At the same time, at the similarly named, but differently catered, Freedom Summit, in Des Moines, Iowa, an event built around the alarmist Representative Steve King, potential Presidential candidates were on full, exhibitionist display. Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum were there, each claiming his own place on the strutting-stridency matrix; so were Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. Special bonus: Carly Fiorina. (Bobby Jindal was at his own rally, called The Response.*) Their presence onstage suggests that the G.O.P. field is wide open—far more so than it is for the Democrats—attracting boom-towners and political Ponzi-schemers, as well as ideologues. There will be plenty of money—hard and soft, smart and speculative—expended as giddily as anything that was ever put into Kozmo.com. A bubble can be less corrosive and bloody than a war, and there’s always a chance that an unlikely startup might make for a successful I.P.O.

"There were a lot of businessmen at Freedom Partners; there was a lot of talk about ordinary people and “crony capitalism” at the Freedom Summit. The latter event probably had the edge in theatricality. After watching several candidates, a Cedar Rapids billboard salesman told the Des Moines Register that he wished some of the “real true conservatives” had the “gravitas” of Chris Christie. Trump berated Romney (“He choked!”) and Sarah Palin improvised about the nature of freedom after her teleprompter went out (“The man can only ride you when your back is bent!”).","960","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"But it would be a mistake to see, in the coincidence of scheduling, a divide between the “establishment” and the upstarts. For one thing, a couple of the candidates, Walker and Cruz, made it to both Freedom pageants; Cruz, who in Iowa spoke about winning over “the forty-seven per cent,” spoke in Rancho Mirage about how the criticism of the Koch brothers was “grotesque.” Rand Paul and Marco Rubio opted solely for Freedom Partners, where Paul dismissed Romney, who was absent, in words only marginally more polite than Trump’s. Rubio, meanwhile, congratulated members of the audience for not trying to bribe him: “I don’t know a single person in this room who has ever been to my office … asking from government any special access.”","961","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"Jeb Bush missed both events; there may have been more people who were sorry about that in the Kochs’ circle than in King’s: it was King who described Dreamers as drug mules with “calves the size of cantaloupes,” which is not quite where Bush wants to be seen standing on immigration. (King’s Freedom Summit was co-sponsored by Citizens United, the group whose victory at the Supreme Court made all sorts of new political sponsorships possible.) Trump, in his speech, attacked Bush’s position on immigration this way: “He said, ‘They are coming for love.’ What? Half of them are criminals!” (A Politico dispatch describing the moment continued, “‘Jeb and Mitt you can’t have!’ Trump yelled. ‘It’s over!’”)","962","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"But the coolness to Jeb is more a matter of degree. According to the Washington Post, Paul, Cruz, and Walker were “favorites” at Rancho Mirage, too: “It’s not as if there’s one perfect champion and five bad individuals,” a “person familiar with donor views” told the paper. The Post added that Freedom Partners “is still debating whether it will spend some of that money in the GOP primaries. Such a move could have a major impact in winnowing the field of contenders but could also undercut the network’s standing if it engaged in intraparty politics and was not successful.”","963","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"Here, again, there might be an instructive contrast with the Democrats. The Republicans are looking at some dubious characters—but at least they are looking. If the G.O.P. is in a market bubble—whether of the tech or tulip variety—the Democrats might be experiencing something more like stagflation. The inflation is in the nominal price assigned to its main product, the putative candidacy of Hillary Clinton. That price keeps going up, without ever seeming to factor in her liabilities. The stagnation is in the party’s development of new voices, and, as a corollary, new ideas. In 2012, the Democrats benefited from the churn on the Republican side and the calm on theirs—but that’s largely because they were running an incumbent. (And it was Obama’s defiance of a similar sort of anointment that allowed him to emerge in 2008.) Now, there’s an artificial freeze on competition. Elizabeth Warren won’t say that she’s interested in running, and, even if she does run, her voice alone wouldn’t mean that there would be a broad debate. The peeps from the general direction of Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, have not been inspiring. (See Ryan Lizza on his travels with O’Malley.)","964","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"
"On both sides, in different ways, there might just be too much money chasing too few goods, to cite another economic dictum. Palin and Romney probably took the weekend’s prizes as the most mockable and the most mocked. And yet, they are also distinguished by being the only two characters in this ensemble whom the G.O.P. has put on a national ticket. If McCain had done just a little better, Palin might have had a chance to fidget at the State of the Union and mortify Americans with her behavior at state funerals. Romney got forty-seven per cent of the popular vote. Do Republicans see either of their nominations as an admonishment, or an inspiration? They made it to the finals; maybe anyone can.","965","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/g-o-p-bubble-vs-democrats-stagflation"

Billie Holiday didn’t revert to slogans when she performed “Strange Fruit”—her voice was enough. When the electric-guitar pickup met napalm, a roaring cast of rock-and-roll artists made their voices heard. Later, in punk music, politics were as important to the form as spiked hair and short songs—and if some bands’ anti-establishment posing could be perceived as a marketing plan, others, such as The Clash, were earnest in their intent.","April 21, 2015","967","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-music-itself-is-a-form-of-protest"

"Then popular music entered a period (in which, it could be argued, it still remains) when it was less a form of consciousness-raising than a means of escape—the MP3 as the opium of the people. Countless gigabytes’ worth of data chronicle the online comings and goings of pop stars, and we eat it up: Miley Cyrus’s transformation from teen idol to mature pop star, or what Kanye said last, or Taylor Swift’s departure from Spotify. Given the recent stir about Hillary Clinton’s fast-food habits and her failure to tip at Chipotle, this shallowness might a problem with the media, not music, but there is also something more pernicious at work. In 1987, Nike shocked many when it chose the Beatles’ ”Revolution” to sell sneakers. The Royal Caribbean cruise line selected “Lust For Life,” a veritable heroin anthem by the anti-establishment icon Iggy Pop, for its TV ads a decade ago. “Fortunate Son,” Creedence Clearwater Revival’s searing 1969 song protesting élitism and the Vietnam War, has been used to sell jeans. The maw of late-stage capitalism has swallowed these songs, neutered much of their meaning, and pressed them into service selling products. This has become so common that it’s hardly remarkable, but it comes at a cost: voices of dissent and protest need to be heard. And if music becomes solely a soundtrack for selling, that’s a loss.","969","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-music-itself-is-a-form-of-protest"

Jay Z made this the central feature of his announcement about Tidal, his new streaming service, which is co-owned by Jack White, Usher, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Madonna, Deadmau5, Kanye West, and other musicians. Geoff Barrow, the founder of the English trip-hop innovators Portishead, recently lit up the Internet when he tweeted that thirty-four million streams of his music had netted him a mere thousand seven hundred pounds, after taxes.","970","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-music-itself-is-a-form-of-protest"
"To get a start, young artists need to do things themselves. This isn’t terribly new. What’s called indie rock was built outside the mainstream decades ago, but, back then, the hope of a major-label triumph remained a golden carrot. Not any more. A young British band called Shopping knows the current paradigm well. The trio—which is made up of two women, Rachel Aggs and Billy Easter, and one guy, Andrew Milk, all with clever haircuts and grit under their fingernails—started making music together in 2012. They pressed their first album themselves and delivered it by hand to record stores in London. They had a hit; it sold out.

Jagged guitar truncheons joust with stomping bass lines while the front woman, Aggs, howls like she’s descended from Ari Up and the Slits. The jocularity of the B-52’s bubbles up from time to time.

"Thanks to the album’s title and the band’s sneering anti-capitalist leanings, the group projects a political edge. But it turns out that that’s not exactly by design. Easter, the bassist, said that the band’s music is a comment on overconsumption and greed. “But that’s only some of the songs, and it’s kind of an accident,” she said. “We don’t have a conscious political agenda.” Milk, the drummer, observed that he sings “about fancying men and Rachel sings about fancying women,” which, he concludes, “is inherently political,” though he added, “we never discussed having a particular political message at all as a band.” However, in a climate where music doesn’t pay like it once did, except for a few winners who take all, success and politics are defined in new terms. Easter said that D.I.Y. culture “opens peoples minds to possibilities they thought weren’t possible.

"Kissinger, though, was not wrong to insist that character and instinct play a large role in a President’s approach to foreign policy. Curiosity, study, and engagement in the world also count for a lot. In 1951, when John F. Kennedy was a thirty-four-year-old Massachusetts congressman, he took a seven-week journey, accompanied by his brother Robert and his sister Patricia, to Saigon to learn about the conflict between France and the Viet Minh. As Fredrik Logevall wrote in “Embers of War,” Kennedy, speaking later in Boston, said, “In Indochina we have allied ourselves to the desperate efforts of the French regime to hang on to the remnants of an empire,” a view that did not find full reflection in United States policy in the region. Richard Nixon, too, was fascinated by the world; a sixty-eight-day trip to Asia that he made in the fall of 1953, when he was Eisenhower’s Vice-President, stayed with him all his life. Character and instinct helped define the Eisenhower years; Ike certainly made mistakes, but through it all you would hear his patience, his resistance to rash action and panic, even in the worst of times. In a diary entry from March, 1955, when some members of his Cabinet were certain that the United States would soon be at war with China, Eisenhower, once the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in the war against Germany, wrote, “I have so often been through these periods of strain that I have become accustomed to the fact that most of the calamities that we anticipate really never occur.”","984","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"

Most candidates have not yet settled on their foreign-policy teams, although advice is plentiful.

(Wolfowitz doesn’t want to be typecast; after all, he’s pointed out, he also worked for George H. W.

But we should hit the pause button on new efforts. Don’t appear too eager to work together. Don’t flatter Putin with high-level attention.” It was odd to see the Secretary of State, on CBS News in 2011, exulting and laughing at the death of Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi, saying, in a variation of a line from Julius Caesar, “We came, we saw, he died.”","987","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-presidential-candidates-greet-the-world"

"For about a century, economic inequality has been measured on a scale, from zero to one, known as the Gini index and named after an Italian statistician, Corrado Gini, who devised it in 1912, when he was twenty-eight and the chair of statistics at the University of Cagliari. If all the income in the world were earned by one person and everyone else earned nothing, the world would have a Gini index of one. If everyone in the world earned exactly the same income, the world would have a Gini index of zero. The United States Census Bureau has been using Gini’s measurement to calculate income inequality in America since 1947. Between 1947 and 1968, the U.S. Gini index dropped to .386, the lowest ever recorded. Then it began to climb.","989","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"

But historical cross-country comparisons are difficult to make; the data are patchy, and different countries measure differently. The Luxembourg Income Study, begun in 1983, harmonizes data collected from more than forty countries on six continents. According to the L.I.S.’s adjusted data, the United States has regularly had the highest Gini index of any affluent democracy.

"The evidence that income inequality in the United States has been growing for decades and is greater than in any other developed democracy is not much disputed. It is widely known and widely studied. Economic inequality has been an academic specialty at least since Gini first put chalk to chalkboard. In the nineteen-fifties, Simon Kuznets, who went on to win a Nobel Prize, used tax data to study the shares of income among groups, an approach that was further developed by the British economist Anthony Atkinson, beginning with his 1969 paper “On the Measurement of Inequality,” in the Journal of Economic Theory. Last year’s unexpected popular success of the English translation of Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-first Century” drew the public’s attention to measurements of inequality, but Piketty’s work had long since reached American social scientists, especially through a 2003 paper that he published with the Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, in The Quarterly Journal of Economics. Believing that the Gini index underestimates inequality, Piketty and Saez favor Kuznets’s approach. (Atkinson, Piketty, Saez, and Facundo Alvaredo are also the creators of the World Top Incomes Database, which collects income-share data from more than twenty countries.) In “Income Inequality in the United States, 1913-1998,” Piketty and Saez used tax data to calculate what percentage of income goes to the top one per cent and to the top ten per cent. In 1928, the top one per cent earned twenty-four per cent of all income; in 1944, they earned eleven per cent, a rate that began to rise in the nineteen-eighties. By 2012, according to Saez’s updated data, the top one per cent were earning twenty-three per cent of the nation’s income, almost the same ratio as in 1928, although it has since dropped slightly.","991","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Political scientists are nearly as likely to study economic inequality as economists are, though they’re less interested in how much inequality a market can bear than in how much a democracy can bear, and here the general thinking is that the United States is nearing its breaking point. In 2001, the American Political Science Association formed a Task Force on Inequality and American Democracy; a few years later, it concluded that growing economic inequality was threatening fundamental American political institutions. In 2009, Oxford University Press published both a seven-hundred-page “Handbook of Economic Inequality” and a collection of essays about the political consequences of economic inequality whose argument is its title: “The Unsustainable American State.” There’s a global version of this argument, too. “Inequality Matters,” a 2013 report by the United Nations, took the view—advanced by the economist Joseph Stiglitz in his book “The Price of Inequality”—that growing income inequality is responsible for all manner of political instability, as well as for the slowing of economic growth worldwide. Last year, when the Pew Research Center conducted a survey about which of five dangers people in forty-four countries consider to be the “greatest threat to the world,” many of the countries polled put religious and ethnic hatred at the top of their lists, but Americans and many Europeans chose inequality.","992","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"What’s new about the chasm between the rich and the poor in the United States, then, isn’t that it’s growing or that scholars are studying it or that people are worried about it. What’s new is that American politicians of all spots and stripes are talking about it, if feebly: inequality this, inequality that. In January, at a forum sponsored by Freedom Partners (a free-market advocacy group with ties to the Koch brothers), the G.O.P. Presidential swains Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio battled over which of them disliked inequality more, agreeing only that its existence wasn’t their fault. “The top one per cent earn a higher share of our income, nationally, than any year since 1928,” Cruz said, drawing on the work of Saez and Piketty. Cruz went on, “I chuckle every time I hear Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton talk about income inequality, because it’s increased dramatically under their policies.” No doubt there has been a lot of talk. “Let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one per cent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth,” Obama said during his State of the Union address. Speaker of the House John Boehner countered that “the President’s policies have made income inequality worse.”","993","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The reason Democrats and Republicans are fighting over who’s to blame for growing economic inequality is that, aside from a certain amount of squabbling, it’s no longer possible to deny that it exists—a development that’s not to be sneezed at, given the state of the debate on climate change. That’s not to say the agreement runs deep; in fact, it couldn’t be shallower. The causes of income inequality are much disputed; so are its costs. And knowing the numbers doesn’t appear to be changing anyone’s mind about what, if anything, should be done about it.","994","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Robert Putnam’s new book, “Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis” (Simon & Schuster), is an attempt to set the statistics aside and, instead, tell a story. “Our Kids” begins with the story of the town where Putnam grew up, Port Clinton, Ohio. Putnam is a political scientist, but his argument is historical—it’s about change over time—and fuelled, in part, by nostalgia. “My hometown was, in the 1950s, a passable embodiment of the American Dream,” he writes, “a place that offered decent opportunity for all the kids in town, whatever their background.” Sixty years later, Putnam says, Port Clinton “is a split-screen American nightmare, a community in which kids from the wrong side of the tracks that bisect the town can barely imagine the future that awaits the kids from the right side of the tracks.”","995","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Inequality-wise, Port Clinton makes a reasonable Middletown. According to the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, Port Clinton’s congressional district, Ohio’s ninth, has a Gini index of .467, which is somewhat lower than the A.C.S.’s estimate of the national average. But “Our Kids” isn’t a book about the Gini index. “Some of us learn from numbers, but more of us learn from stories,” according to an appendix that Putnam co-wrote with Jennifer M. Silva. Putnam, the author of “Bowling Alone,” is the director of the Saguaro Seminar for civic engagement at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government; Silva, a sociologist, has been a postdoctoral fellow there. In her 2013 book “Coming Up Short: Working-Class Adulthood in an Age of Uncertainty” (Oxford), Silva reported the results of interviews she conducted with a hundred working-class adults in Lowell, Massachusetts and Richmond, Virginia, described her account of the structural inequalities that shape their lives as “a story of institutions—not individuals or their families,” and argued that those inequalities are the consequence of the past half century’s “massive effort to roll back social protections from the market.” For “Our Kids,” Silva visited Robert Putnam’s home town and interviewed young people and their parents. Putnam graduated from Port Clinton High School in 1959. The surviving members of his class are now in their mid-seventies. Putnam and Silva sent them questionnaires; seventy-five people returned them. Silva also spent two years interviewing more than a hundred young adults in nine other cities and counties across the nation. As Putnam and Silva note, Silva conducted nearly all of the interviews Putnam uses in his book.","996","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"“Our Kids” is a heartfelt portrait of four generations: Putnam’s fellow 1959 graduates and their children, and the kids in Port Clinton and those nine other communities today and their parents. The book tells more or less the same story that the numbers tell; it’s just got people in it. Specifically, it’s got kids: the kids Putnam used to know, and, above all, the kids Silva interviewed. The book proceeds from the depressing assumption that presenting the harrowing lives of poor young people is the best way to get Americans to care about poverty.","997","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Putnam has changed the names of all his subjects and removed certain identifying details. He writes about them as characters. First, there’s Don. He went to Port Clinton High School with Putnam. His father worked two jobs: an eight-hour shift at Port Clinton Manufacturing, followed by seven and a half hours at a local canning plant. A minister in town helped Don apply to university. “I didn’t know I was poor until I went to college,” Don says. He graduated from college, became a minister, and married a high-school teacher; they had one child, who became a high-school librarian. Libby, another member of Putnam’s graduating class, was the sixth of ten children. Like Don’s parents, neither of Libby’s parents finished high school. Her father worked at Standard Products, a factory on Maple Street that made many different things out of rubber, from weather stripping to tank treads. Libby won a scholarship to the University of Toledo, but dropped out to get married and have kids. Twenty years later, after a divorce, she got a job as a clerk in a lumberyard, worked her way up to becoming a writer for a local newspaper, and eventually ran for countywide office and won.","998","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"All but two of the members of Putnam’s graduating class were white. Putnam’s wistfulness toward his childhood home town is at times painful to read. The whiteness of Port Clinton in the nineteen-fifties was not mere happenstance but the consequence of discriminatory housing and employment practices. I glanced through the records of the Ohio chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., which included a branch in Port Clinton. The Ohio chapter’s report for 1957 chronicles, among other things, its failed attempt to gain passage of statewide Fair Housing legislation; describes how “cross burnings occurred in many cities in Ohio”; recounts instances of police brutality, including in Columbus, where a patrolman beat a woman “with the butt of his pistol all over her face and body”; and states that in Toledo, Columbus, “and in a number of other communities, the Association intervened in situations where violence flared up or was threatened when Negro families moved into formerly ‘all-white neighborhoods.’ ” Thurgood Marshall, the director of the N.A.A.C.P.’s Legal Defense and Educational Fund, spoke in Ohio in 1958, after which a sympathetic Cleveland newspaper wrote that Marshall “will never be named to the Supreme Court.” In 1960, the Ohio N.A.A.C.P. launched a statewide voter-registration drive. One pamphlet asked, “Are you permitted to live wherever you please in any Ohio City?” Putnam acknowledges that there was a lot of racism in Port Clinton, but he suggests that, whatever hardships the two black kids in his class faced because they were black, the American dream was nevertheless theirs. This fails to convince. As one of those two kids, now grown, tells Putnam, “Your then was not my then, and your now isn’t even my now.”","999","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In any case, the world changed, and Port Clinton changed with it. “Most of the downtown shops of my youth stand empty and derelict,” Putnam writes. In the late nineteen-sixties, the heyday of the Great Society, when income inequality in the United States was as low as it has ever been, the same was probably true of Port Clinton. But in the nineteen-seventies the town’s manufacturing base collapsed. Standard Products laid off more than half of its workers. In 1993, the plant closed. Since then, unemployment has continued to rise and wages to fall. Between 1999 and 2013, the percentage of children in Port Clinton living in poverty rose from ten to forty.","1000","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Silva found David hanging out in a park. His father, currently in prison, never had a steady job. David’s parents separated when he was a little boy. He bounced around, attending seven elementary schools. When he was thirteen, he was arrested for robbery. He graduated from high school only because he was given course credit for hours he’d worked at Big Boppers Diner (from which he was fired after graduation). In 2012, when David was eighteen, he got his girlfriend pregnant. “I’ll never get ahead,” he posted on his Facebook page last year, after his girlfriend left him. “I’m FUCKING DONE.”","1001","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Wealthy newcomers began arriving in the nineteen-nineties. On the shores of Lake Erie, just a few miles past Port Clinton’s trailer parks, they built mansions and golf courses and gated communities. “Chelsea and her family live in a large white home with a wide porch overlooking the lake,” Putnam writes, introducing another of his younger characters. Chelsea was the president of her high school’s student body and editor of the yearbook. Her mother, Wendy, works part time; her father, Dick, is a businessman. In the basement of their house, Wendy and Dick had a “1950s-style diner” built so that Chelsea and her brother would have a place to hang out with their friends. When Chelsea’s brother got a bad grade in school, Wendy went all the way to the school board to get it changed. Chelsea and her brother are now in college. Wendy does not appear to believe in welfare. “You have to work if you want to get rich,” she says. “If my kids are going to be successful, I don’t think they should have to pay other people who are sitting around doing nothing for their success.”","1002","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Aside from the anecdotes, the bulk of “Our Kids” is an omnibus of social-science scholarship. The book’s chief and authoritative contribution is its careful presentation for a popular audience of important work on the erosion, in the past half century, of so many forms of social, economic, and political support for families, schools, and communities—with consequences that amount to what Silva and others have called the “privatization of risk.” The social-science literature includes a complicated debate about the relationship between inequality of outcome (differences of income and of wealth) and inequality of opportunity (differences in education and employment). To most readers, these issues are more familiar as a political disagreement. In American politics, Democrats are more likely to talk about both kinds of inequality, while Republicans tend to confine their concern to inequality of opportunity. According to Putnam, “All sides in this debate agree on one thing, however: as income inequality expands, kids from more privileged backgrounds start and probably finish further and further ahead of their less privileged peers, even if the rate of socioeconomic mobility is unchanged.” He also takes the position, again relying on a considerable body of scholarship, that, “quite apart from the danger that the opportunity gap poses to American prosperity, it also undermines our democracy.” Chelsea is interested in politics. David has never voted.","1003","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The American dream is in crisis, Putnam argues, because Americans used to care about other people’s kids and now they only care about their own kids. But, he writes, “America’s poor kids do belong to us and we to them. They are our kids.” This is a lot like his argument in “Bowling Alone.” In high school in Port Clinton, Putnam was in a bowling league; he regards bowling leagues as a marker of community and civic engagement; bowling leagues are in decline; hence, Americans don’t take care of one another anymore. “Bowling Alone” and “Our Kids” also have the same homey just-folksiness. And they have the same shortcomings. If you don’t miss bowling leagues or all-white suburbs where women wear aprons—if Putnam’s then was not your then and his now isn’t your now—his well-intentioned “we” can be remarkably grating.","1004","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In story form, the argument of “Our Kids” is that while Wendy and Dick were building a fifties-style diner for their kids in the basement of their lakefront mansion, grade-grubbing with their son’s teachers, and glue-gunning the decorations for their daughter’s prom, every decent place to hang out in Port Clinton closed its doors, David was fired from his job at Big Boppers, and he got his girlfriend pregnant because, by the time David and Chelsea were born, in the nineteen-nineties, not only was Standard Products out of business but gone, too, was the sense of civic obligation and commonweal—everyone caring about everyone else’s kids—that had made it possible for Don and Libby to climb out of poverty in the nineteen-fifties and the nineteen-sixties. “Nobody gave a shit,” David says. And he’s not wrong.","1005","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"“Our Kids” is a passionate, urgent book. It also has a sad helplessness. Putnam tells a story teeming with characters and full of misery but without a single villain. This is deliberate. “This is a book without upper-class villains,” he insists in the book’s final chapter. In January, Putnam tweeted, “My new book ‘Our Kids’ shows a growing gap between rich kids and poor kids. We’ll work with all sides on solutions.” It’s easier to work with all sides if no side is to blame. But Putnam’s eagerness to influence Congress has narrative consequences. If you’re going to tell a story about bad things happening to good people, you’ve got to offer an explanation, and, when you make your arguments through characters, your reader will expect that explanation in the form of characters. I feel bad for Chelsea. But I feel worse for David. Am I supposed to hate Wendy?","1006","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Some people make arguments by telling stories; other people make arguments by counting things. Charles Dickens was a story man. In “Hard Times” (1854), a novel written when statistics was on the rise, Dickens’s villain, Thomas Gradgrind, was a numbers man, “a man of facts and calculations,” who named one of his sons Adam Smith and another Malthus. “With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication table always in his pocket, Sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.”","1007","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Numbers men are remote and cold of heart, Dickens thought. But, of course, the appeal of numbers lies in their remoteness and coldness. Numbers depersonalize; that remains one of their chief claims to authority, and to a different explanatory force than can be found in, say, a poem. “Quantification is a technology of distance,” as the historian of science Theodore Porter has pointed out. “Reliance on numbers and quantitative manipulation minimizes the need for intimate knowledge and personal trust.” It’s difficult to understand something like income inequality across large populations and to communicate your understanding of it across vast distances without counting. But quantification’s lack of intimacy is also its weakness; it represents not only a gain but also a loss of knowledge.","1008","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Corrado Gini, he of the Gini index, was a numbers man, at a time when statistics had become a modern science. In 1925, four years after Gini wrote “Measurement of Inequality of Incomes,” he signed the “Manifesto of Fascist Intellectuals” (he was the only statistician to do so) and was soon running the Presidential Commission for the Study of Constitutional Reforms. As Jean-Guy Prévost reported in “A Total Science: Statistics in Liberal and Fascist Italy” (2009), Gini’s work was so closely tied to the Fascist state that, in 1944, after the regime fell, he was tried for being an apologist for Fascism. In the shadow of his trial, he joined the Movimento Unionista Italiano, a political party whose objective was to annex Italy to the United States. “This would solve all of Italy’s problems,” the movement’s founder, Santi Paladino, told a reporter for Time. (“Paladino has never visited the U.S., though his wife Francesca lived 24 years in The Bronx,” the magazine noted.) But, for Gini, the movement’s purpose was to provide him with some anti-Fascist credentials.","1009","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"The story of Gini is a good illustration of the problem with stories, which is that they personalize (which is also their power). His support for Fascism doesn’t mean that the Gini index isn’t valuable. It is valuable. The life of Corrado Gini can’t be used to undermine all of statistical science. Still, if you wanted to write an indictment of statistics as an instrument of authoritarian states, and if you had a great deal of other evidence to support that indictment—including other stories and, ideally, numbers—why yes, Gini would be an excellent character to introduce in Chapter 1.","1010","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Because stories contain one kind of truth and numbers another, many writers mix and match, telling representative stories and backing them up with aggregate data. Putnam, though, doesn’t so much mix and match as split the difference. He tells stories about kids but presents data about the economy. That’s why “Our Kids” has heaps of victims but not a single villain. “We encounter Elijah in a dingy shopping mall on the north side of Atlanta, during his lunch break from a job packing groceries,” Putnam writes. “Elijah is thin and small in stature, perhaps five foot seven, and wears baggy clothes that bulk his frame: jeans belted low around his upper thighs, a pair of Jordans on his feet.” As for why Elijah is packing groceries, the book offers not characters—there are no interviews, for instance, with members of the Georgia legislature or the heads of national corporations whose businesses have left Atlanta—but numbers, citing statistics about the city (“Large swaths of southern and western Atlanta itself are over 95 percent black, with child poverty rates ranging from 50 percent to 80 percent”) and providing a series of charts reporting the results of studies about things like class differences in parenting styles and in the frequency of the family dinner.","1011","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"In “The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power” (Little, Brown), Steve Fraser fumes that what’s gone wrong with political discourse in America is that the left isn’t willing to blame anyone for anything anymore. There used to be battle cries. No more kings! Down with fat cats! Damn the moneycrats! Like Putnam’s argument, Fraser’s is both historical and nostalgic. Fraser longs for the passion and force with which Americans of earlier generations attacked aggregated power. Think of the way Frederick Douglass wrote about slavery, Ida B. Wells wrote about lynching, Ida Tarbell wrote about Standard Oil, Upton Sinclair wrote about the meatpacking industry, and Louis Brandeis wrote about the money trust. These people weren’t squeamish about villains.","1012","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"To chronicle the rise of acquiescence, Fraser examines two differences between the long nineteenth century and today. “The first Gilded Age, despite its glaring inequities, was accompanied by a gradual rise in the standard of living; the second by a gradual erosion,” he writes. In the first Gilded Age, everyone from reporters to politicians apparently felt comfortable painting plutocrats as villains; in the second, this is, somehow, forbidden. “If the first Gilded Age was full of sound and fury,” he writes, “the second seemed to take place in a padded cell.” Fraser argues that while Progressive Era muckrakers ended the first Gilded Age by drawing on an age-old tradition of dissent to criticize prevailing economic, social, and political arrangements, today’s left doesn’t engage in dissent; it engages in consent, urging solutions that align with neoliberalism, technological determinism, and global capitalism: “Environmental despoiling arouses righteous eating; cultural decay inspires charter schools; rebellion against work becomes work as a form of rebellion; old-form anticlericalism morphs into the piety of the secular; the break with convention ends up as the politics of style; the cri de coeur against alienation surrenders to the triumph of the solitary; the marriage of political and cultural radicalism ends in divorce.” Why not blame the financial industry? Why not blame the Congress that deregulated it? Why not blame the system itself? Because, Fraser argues, the left has been cowed into silence on the main subject at hand: “What we could not do, what was not even speakable, was to tamper with the basic institutions of financial capitalism.”","1013","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Putnam closes “Our Kids” with a chapter called “What Is to Be Done?” Tampering with the basic institutions of financial capitalism is not on his to-do list. The chapter includes one table, one chart, many stories, and this statement: “The absence of personal villains in our stories does not mean that no one is at fault.” At fault are “social policies that reflect collective decisions,” and, “insofar as we have some responsibility for those collective decisions, we are implicated by our failure to address removable barriers to others’ success.” What can Putnam’s “we” do? He proposes changes in four realms: family structure, parenting, school, and community. His policy recommendations include expanding the earned-income tax credit and protecting existing anti-poverty programs; implementing more generous parental leaves, better child-care programs, and state-funded preschool; equalizing the funding of public schools, providing more community-based neighborhood schools, and increasing support for vocational high-school programs and for community colleges; ending pay-to-play extracurricular activities in public schools and developing mentorship programs that tie schools to communities and community organizations.","1014","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"

"“Inequality: What Can Be Done?,” by Anthony Atkinson, will be published this spring (Harvard). Atkinson is a renowned expert on the measurement of economic inequality, but in “Inequality” he hides his math. “There are a number of graphs, and a small number of tables,” he writes, by way of apology, and he paraphrases Stephen Hawking: “Every equation halves the number of readers.”","1016","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Much of the book is a discussion of specific proposals. Atkinson believes that solutions like Putnam’s, which focus on inequality of opportunity, mainly through reforms having to do with public education, are inadequate. Atkinson thinks that the division between inequality of outcome and inequality of opportunity is largely false. He believes that tackling inequality of outcome is a very good way to tackle inequality of opportunity. (If you help a grownup get a job, her kids will have a better chance of climbing out of poverty, too.) Above all, he disagrees with the widespread assumption that technological progress and globalization are responsible for growing inequality. That assumption, he argues, is wrong and also dangerous, because it encourages the belief that growing inequality is inevitable.","1017","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Atkinson points out that neither globalization nor rapid technological advance is new and there are, therefore, lessons to be learned from history. Those lessons do not involve nostalgia. (Atkinson is actually an optimistic sort, and he spends time appreciating rising standards of living, worldwide.) One of those lessons is that globalizing economies aren’t like hurricanes or other acts of God or nature. Instead, they’re governed by laws regulating things like unions and trusts and banks and wages and taxes; laws are passed by legislators; in democracies, legislators are elected. So, too, new technologies don’t simply fall out of the sky, like meteors or little miracles. “The direction of technological change is the product of decisions by firms, researchers, and governments,” Atkinson writes. The iPhone exists, as Mariana Mazzucato demonstrated in her 2013 book “The Entrepreneurial State,” because various branches of the U.S. government provided research assistance that resulted in several key technological developments, including G.P.S., multi-touch screens, L.C.D. displays, lithium-ion batteries, and cellular networks.","1018","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Atkinson isn’t interested in stories the way Putnam is interested in stories. And he isn’t interested in villains the way Fraser is interested in villains. But he is interested in responsible parties, and in demanding government action. “It is not enough to say that rising inequality is due to technological forces outside our control,” Atkinson writes. “The government can influence the path taken.” In “Inequality: What Can Be Done?,” he offers fifteen proposals, from the familiar (unemployment programs, national savings bonds, and a more progressive tax structure) to the novel (a governmental role in the direction of technological development, a capital endowment or “minimum inheritance” paid to everyone on reaching adulthood), along with five “ideas to pursue,” which is where things get Piketty (a global tax on wealth, a minimum tax on corporations).","1019","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"

"It might be that people have been studying inequality in all the wrong places. A few years ago, two scholars of comparative politics, Alfred Stepan, at Columbia, and the late Juan J. Linz—numbers men—tried to figure out why the United States has for so long had much greater income inequality than any other developed democracy. Because this disparity has been more or less constant, the question doesn’t lend itself very well to historical analysis. Nor is it easily subject to the distortions of nostalgia. But it does lend itself very well to comparative analysis.","1021","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Stepan and Linz identified twenty-three long-standing democracies with advanced economies. Then they counted the number of veto players in each of those twenty-three governments. (A veto player is a person or body that can block a policy decision. Stepan and Linz explain, “For example, in the United States, the Senate and the House of Representatives are veto players because without their consent, no bill can become a law.”) More than half of the twenty-three countries Stepan and Linz studied have only one veto player; most of these countries have unicameral parliaments. A few countries have two veto players; Switzerland and Australia have three. Only the United States has four. Then they made a chart, comparing Gini indices with veto-player numbers: the more veto players in a government, the greater the nation’s economic inequality. This is only a correlation, of course, and cross-country economic comparisons are fraught, but it’s interesting.","1022","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"
"Then they observed something more. Their twenty-three democracies included eight federal governments with both upper and lower legislative bodies. Using the number of seats and the size of the population to calculate malapportionment, they assigned a “Gini Index of Inequality of Representation” to those eight upper houses, and found that the United States had the highest score: it has the most malapportioned and the least representative upper house. These scores, too, correlated with the countries’ Gini scores for income inequality: the less representative the upper body of a national legislature, the greater the gap between the rich and the poor.","1023","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/richer-and-poorer"

"For a North Korean watcher, seeing “The Interview” is like seeing an earnest endeavor reflected back through a freak-show mirror. But, behind the silliness and the smut, the penis and butthole jokes, the filmmakers get a lot right about North Korea.","January 2, 2015","1025","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"

"In the opening scene, an angelic schoolgirl with rouged cheeks sings, “Die, America, die. … It would fill my tiny heart with joy” in front of the monument to the Workers’ Party in Pyongyang. The little ditty precedes a shot of a missile blasting off. Of course, North Korea’s missiles aren’t launched from the middle of Pyongyang, but, giving the filmmakers artistic license, the scene perfectly captures the anti-American propaganda in a country where kindergartens, according to the A.P., feature posters of schoolchildren bayonetting a bloodied U.S. soldier. Or, as I wrote in my own book, “Nothing to Envy,” where there is a song taught to schoolchildren called “Shoot the Yankee Bastards.”","1027","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"After the opening, the plot begins to progress: Talk-show host Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen) fly to Pyongyang for an exclusive interview with leader Kim Jong-un, who they have been assigned by the C.I.A. to kill.","1028","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"From the airplane’s interior, with its lace-doily-backed seats, to the protagonists’ lavishly appointed guesthouse, the atmospherics ring true. First-time visitors to North Korea are always surprised that such a poor country can provide comfortable accommodations and abundant food when it wants to make a good impression. The fictional journalists of “The Interview” are impressed, too.","1029","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"Kim Jong-un appears at first to Skylark to be a gracious young man, unfailingly polite as a host and anxious to show that he cares about his people. (One factual error, however: he is played by the much too handsome Randall Park.) The two enjoy a friendly game of basketball, drink margaritas, and yuk it up. I’m assuming this scene was inspired by the visits to Pyongyang by the ex-N.B.A. star Dennis Rodman, who described a “seven-star” party with jet skis, cocktails, and luxury yachts, and who characterized Kim Jong-un as a “good friend.”","1030","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"Kim and Skylark are also entertained by a troupe of semi-clad dancers, no doubt based on the gippenjo, the “pleasure brigades” of young women assigned to the North Korean leadership. At one point, Seth Rogen’s North Korean love interest, a propaganda official named Sook (played by Diana Bang) tells how Party officials came into her classroom when she was a schoolgirl and selected her for the personal staff of the Kim family. The description matches defectors’ accounts of attractive girls plucked from their hometowns to serve the leadership.","1031","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"Kim shows Skylark a tank that he says was a gift to his grandfather, North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung, from Joseph Stalin. Actually, the gift that Stalin gave was a bullet-proof limousine, but the scene works. As for the Siberian tiger that pounces on Rapaport—well, tigers largely disappeared from the Korean peninsula in the twentieth century, and I’m quite certain that there are none roaming freely in Pyongyang nowadays.","1032","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"Skylark is initially convinced by a display of fresh fruits and vegetables in a supermarket that food is in abundant supply, but, later in the film, he has a moment of reckoning when he picks up one of the grapefruit and discovers it is a fake. Here the movie is effectively playing with the contrast between illusion and reality in the country. Visitors to Pyongyang in the famine years of the nineteen-nineties used to describe supermarkets that displayed plastic produce. (These days, Pyongyang has several expensive foreign-currency shops.) And the capital is often described as a large Potemkin village, an elaborate stage set designed to fool outsiders into believing that North Korea is as rich and powerful as its propaganda claims.","1033","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"The real Kim Jong-un is the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea. He took power in his late twenties, in December, 2011, after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il. Educated as a child in Switzerland, he had more exposure to Western culture than his father. In “The Interview,” he is depicted as a fan of the singer Katy Perry. I can’t speak to the leader’s taste in music, but his brother is a well-documented fan of Eric Clapton.","1034","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"From my viewpoint, what the film gets most right is the psychology of North Korea. The regime is held together by the myth that members of the Kim family are gods, ruling by divine providence. “The Interview” addresses this phenomenon with toilet humor when Skylark asks the fictional Kim, “Do you pee and poo? … You mean, you’ve got a butthole?” (I’ve never heard North Koreans speculate about the leadership’s toilet habits, but I recall a North Korean doctor telling me that she was amazed by Kim Il-sung’s death, at the age of 82; she hadn’t believed that he could die like an ordinary mortal.)","1035","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"The film didn’t start out being about North Korea. Screenwriter Dan Sterling said in an interview with Esquire that he originally thought about an interview-turned-assassination with Osama bin Laden. But he decided that Sacha Baron Cohen had cornered the market for parodies of Middle Eastern tyrants. “So I went off and tried to figure out another notorious iconic world leader and country where we could send Seth and a buddy to get themselves in all kinds of trouble,’’ Sterling said. “I came back to them with North Korea and they were very excited about that because they were just as fascinated by North Korea as I am.’’","1036","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"In the Esquire interview, Sterling said that the filmmakers did their research by reading numerous non-fiction books about North Korea (specifically citing Escape from Camp 14, about a concentration camp, and Nothing to Envy), and by watching video footage from the country. He also said that the script was reviewed by a “high-level person who was in Hillary Clinton’s State Department.” That person was not identified. Kim Jong-il was the film’s intended target until his death, three years ago, and the filmmakers substituted Kim Jong-un.","1037","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"As a parody, the movie is almost as damning in its portrayal of U.S. attitudes toward North Korea. The fictional television journalists sound as hysterical as real-life American television journalists reporting on North Korean missiles capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States. (For many years, it has been erroneously suggested that North Korean missile fragments were found in Alaska.) And the plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un doesn’t sound altogether implausible. Peter Hayes, a co-founder and the executive director of the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability, recently pointed to an August 14th U.S. Strategic Command symposium, currently on YouTube, in which a retired U.S. major general openly discussed assassination as an option to put in the “kitbag” to deal with Kim Jong-un.","1038","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"The scene that has raised the most objections in “The Interview” is at the very end, when Kim’s head dissolves into flames. To me, it feels gratuitous. The actual money shot is when Skylark interviews Kim on a live international television broadcast and reduces the young dictator to tears. “I don’t need my father,” he sobs. “I am strong.” He is revealed as human and fallible, puncturing the underlying myth of North Korea.","1039","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"
"Perhaps the truest words are spoken by the fictional North Korean propagandist, Sook: “Killing Kim won’t change anything. … The people need to be shown that he is not a god, that he is man.” When Skylark challenges her, she questions him, “How many times can the U.S. make the same mistake?”","1040","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/north-korea-watcher-watches-interview"

"For twenty years, many people in Israel and in the West have expressed the hope that Benjamin Netanyahu would prove to be the Richard Nixon of the State of Israel. Not the paranoid Nixon of the Watergate scandals or the embittered Nixon raving drunkenly at the White House portraits at four in the morning but the Nixon who yearned to enter the pantheon of statesmen, and who defied his Red-baiting past and initiated diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China. Wasn’t it possible that Netanyahu, whose political biography was steeped in the intransigent nationalism of the Revisionist movement, was just the right politician to make a lasting peace with the Palestinians?","1042","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"It is amazing to recall how long this fantasy persisted. Even President Obama, whose relationship with Netanyahu is now poisoned by mistrust, once suspended disbelief. “There’s the famous example of Richard Nixon going to China,” he said, in 2009. “A Democrat couldn’t have gone to China. A liberal couldn’t have gone to China. But a big anti-Communist like Richard Nixon could open that door. Now, it’s conceivable that Prime Minister Netanyahu can play that same role.” Netanyahu, as he went on building settlements, deftly kept this illusion alive. In a speech six years ago, at Bar-Ilan University, and in comments as recently as last year, he spoke of his conditional support for “two states for two peoples.”","1043","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"In last week’s Israeli elections, Netanyahu did play the role of Nixon—except that he did not go to China. Nor did he go to Ramallah. He went racist. In 1968, Nixon spoke the coded language of states’ rights and law-and-order politics in order to heighten the fears of white voters in the South, who felt diminished and disempowered by the civil-rights movement and by the Democrat in the White House, Lyndon B. Johnson. Nixon’s swampy maneuvers helped defeat the Democrat Hubert Humphrey and secure the South as an electoral safe haven for more than forty years.","1044","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Netanyahu, a student—practically a member—of the G.O.P., is no beginner at this demagogic game. In 1995, as the leader of the opposition, he spoke at rallies where he questioned the Jewishness of Yitzhak Rabin’s attempt to make peace with the Palestinians through the Oslo Accords. This bit of code was not lost on the ultra-Orthodox or on the settlers. Netanyahu refused to rein in fanatics among his supporters who carried signs portraying Rabin as a Nazi or wearing, à la Arafat, a kaffiyeh.","1045","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Last week, Netanyahu, sensing an electoral threat from a center-left coalition led by Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, unleashed a campaign finale steeped in nativist fear and hatred of the Other. This time, there was not a trace of subtlety. “Right-wing rule is in danger,” he warned his supporters. “Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls.” On Israeli TV, he said, “If we don’t close the gap in the next few days, Herzog and Livni, supported by Arabs and leftist N.G.O.s, will form the next government.” (Twenty per cent of the Israeli citizenry is Arab.) He warned darkly of “left-wing people from outside,” including perfidious “Scandinavians,” and “tens of millions of dollars” being used to “mobilize the Arab vote.” Pro-Likud phone banks reminded voters that Netanyahu’s opponents had the support of “Hussein Obama.”","1046","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"The day before the election, Netanyahu made it clear that, after so many years of periodically flashing the Nixon-goes-to-China card to keep the center-left and the meddling “foreigners” at bay, he would play a new hand. “Whoever moves to establish a Palestinian state or intends to withdraw from territory is simply yielding territory for radical Islamic terrorist attacks against Israel,” he said in an interview with NRG, a right-leaning Israeli news site. Pressed to say if this meant that he would never agree to a Palestinian state, he answered, “Indeed.”","1047","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Netanyahu’s survival instincts are impressive. While he was arousing fear of Arabs and Scandinavians, he was relying on the support of an actual foreign patron, Sheldon Adelson, the American billionaire and casino operator. Adelson owns and publishes Israel Hayom (Israel Today), the country’s highest-circulation daily—a propaganda sheet whose sole purpose is to support the Prime Minister and Likud. Adelson is Netanyahu’s piggy bank and reflects a cruder version of his ideological impulses. Adelson has dismissed the Palestinians as “an invented people,” and he doesn’t mind if Israel strays from democratic principles and norms: “I don’t think the Bible says anything about democracy.” He was in a seat of honor and beaming with satisfaction when, three weeks ago, Netanyahu defied Obama and delivered his speech to Congress opposing a nuclear deal with Iran.","1048","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Now that he has been reëlected, Netanyahu has started to walk back his remarks, telling interviewers that he didn’t mean what he said about “droves” of Arabs, that he is all for a secure two-state solution. Nixon goes to China—again! But why should anyone believe it? Netanyahu’s victory—the way he achieved it and what it says about the politics of the Israeli majority—is clarifying. Josh Earnest, President Obama’s spokesman, said that the Administration was unmoved by Netanyahu’s post-election attempts to make nice, and declared that “the United States is in a position to reëvaluate our thinking.” The Republicans’ position is clear—you get the sense that their congressional leadership would like to see Netanyahu go big-time and get on the ballot in Iowa and New Hampshire—but what about Hillary Clinton? Will she have the political courage to speak frankly and risk alienating some of her more conservative donors? The Palestinians, for their part, have every reason to believe that Netanyahu has shown both his hand and his heart; they will likely drop any thought of negotiations and take their campaign for statehood to the United Nations. For the first time, they may not face a reflexive veto from the United States.","1049","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Netanyahu, of course, does not view himself as Richard Nixon. In his imagination, he is Winston Churchill, the valorous protector of his nation, the singular leader of clear, unerring vision. Nearly two hundred former Israeli military and security chiefs, none of them naïve about the multiple dangers of the Middle East, have declared that further brinkmanship threatens the long-term stability of the nation. But Netanyahu is sure that he knows better. The tragedy is that the likely price of his vainglory is the increasing isolation of a country founded as a democratic refuge for a despised and decimated people. He will soon surpass David Ben-Gurion as Israel’s longest consecutively serving Prime Minister. Unfortunately, this has given Netanyahu plenty of time to erode the tone of his country’s political discourse. And so now, as he forms an unabashedly right-wing and religious government, he stands in opposition not only to the founding aspirations of his nation but also to those Israelis—Jews and Arabs—who stand for tolerance, equality, democratic ideals, and a just, secure peace. ♦","1050","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/base-appeals"
"Among the many powerful images that circulated the week after the attacks in Paris, one was notable for its absurdity. A photograph, which ran in the Israeli ultra-Orthodox daily newspaper Hamevaser, showed the world’s heads of state, marching arm in arm in solidarity. Or rather, the male heads of state: female leaders, most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel, had been digitally removed from the photo in the name of religious modesty. The move was swiftly condemned. Here was flagrant religious intolerance, in the depiction of an event intended to protest such intolerance. By the next day, spoofs of the doctored image had started to circulate: one removed all the men from the photo; another turned everyone into Merkel.","January 18, 2015","1051","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"

In 2011, the Brooklyn-based newspaper Di Tzeitung was shown to have removed Hillary Clinton and another woman from the historic photo of the White House Situation Room during the raid on Osama bin Laden.) Even within the ultra-Orthodox community, which numbers some eight hundred thousand in Israel, Hamevaser is a niche publication, read by only seven per cent of ultra-Orthodox people, or Haredim. But to laugh off the image, to treat it as a curiosity, would be to disregard a serious fight being waged in Israel over the representation of women in the public sphere.","1052","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"Israel has a history of greater gender equality than many Western countries. Since the turn of the twentieth century, women have been working alongside men in the kibbutz movement. Female soldiers have served in the Israel Defense Forces since its founding, with the country, in 1948. In 1969, the year Gloria Steinem threw down the gauntlet of second-wave feminism in the United States—“After Black Power, Women’s Liberation”—Israelis elected a woman, Golda Meir, as their prime minister.","1053","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"Over the past decade, however, as the Haredim have grown in numbers and influence, women’s equality has significantly declined. In 2011, a female pediatrics professor was forbidden from going onstage to collect an award given by the Health Ministry; she was instructed to send a male colleague to accept it on her behalf. The same year, in the city of Beit Shemesh, where almost half the population identifies as Haredi, a group of Haredi men routinely hounded and spat at an eight-year-old girl for not being dressed “modestly enough.” When four hundred women protested the introduction of segregated buses in the city, they were pummeled with stones. There have been other recent instances of the custom known in Hebrew as hadarat nashim, or the exclusion of women, such as the chief rabbi of the air force ordering religious soldiers to walk out of events where female soldiers sing. But perhaps the most visible dispute has been taking place on the streets of Jerusalem, where a quarter of the residents now identify as Haredi.","1054","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"In 2008, a thirty-year-old religious woman named Rachel Azaria headed a slate of candidates for city council. Her team had arranged to mount an ad campaign on the back of buses in the city that would feature her picture. In order to finalize the details of the campaign, Azaria called Cnaan Media, the company in charge of Jerusalem bus advertisements. “We’ve already had a schedule, we picked out the bus lines, everything,” Azaria told me on the phone this week. She was about to close the deal when the company’s salesperson casually told her: “I just want to make sure you know that we don’t show women on buses in the city.”","1055","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"“I was stunned,” Azaria recounted. She hung up the phone, walked out to the street, and looked around her at passing buses. One featured an ad for a wedding venue. “It showed a groom, and a bouquet, and a set table—but no bride,” she said. “I couldn’t believe that this was happening. It was a gradual process in which women literally disappeared from Jerusalem.”","1056","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"Azaria petitioned the High Court of Justice to force Cnaan Media to run the ads and, before the local elections, the judge ruled in her favor. Her face was plastered on the back of five buses, and she ended up winning a seat on the council, but the old restrictions soon resurfaced. Azaria also discovered that women were no longer appearing on Jerusalem billboards. During the months before the 2009 general elections, images of Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister and leader of the Kadima party, were blacked out on posters across Jerusalem. In 2012, a credit-card company replaced the face of Gila Almagor, a renowned theatre actress, with that of a man in its Jerusalem ads. Honigman, a fashion brand, “adjusted” its campaign featuring the model Sendi Bar to show, in Jerusalem, only her torso. That year, posters for the Jerusalem Marathon portrayed only male runners—until public outcry caused the city to add images of women.","1057","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"Azaria, who is now the city’s deputy mayor and holds the women’s issues portfolio, says that the fact that showing images of women has become a public issue means that she has made some progress. She partly credits this growing awareness to the broader social-protest movement in Israel, started in 2011, which championed values of equal rights and personal freedom. But much of her support, she says, comes from Haredi women, who are tired of not being seen. Haredi women traditionally do not take part in politics, but now a group of Haredi women, The Mothers’ List, is seeking representation in the Jerusalem council. In fact, Azaria often has to argue with the city’s secular population, she says. “In the so-called name of multiculturalism, they tell me, ‘What do you care? That’s how the Haredim want to live.’ But I tell them that as a religious woman it affects me, that it’s a mixed city. There’s no separation here.”","1058","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"A new book by Elana Maryles Sztokman called “The War on Women in Israel” also takes to task the secular population—which includes Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat—for not putting an end to the exclusion and suppression of women. “What is perhaps most surprising about the rising oppression of women in Israel is the ease with which non-ultra-Orthodox people and groups capitulate to ultra-Orthodox demands to erase women from the public,” Sztokman writes.","1059","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"In recent years, a nonprofit organization called the Yerushalmit Movement has also advocated for women’s representation in the city. The significance of the issue, according to Shira Katz-Vinkler, who heads the organization, is not only civic but also symbolic. “Jerusalem is the capital of a democratic country, so everything that happens here is a microcosm of what’s happening in Israeli society at large,” she told me. “That’s why it’s crucial that we keep the city open and accepting of each and every person who belongs to the three religions that regard the city as their home.”","1060","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"Katz-Vinkler said the doctored photo from the Paris march was not surprising, but “there’s still no getting used to it.” “For years, we were a silent majority. But we’ve started to realize that if we don’t stand up to extremism, then our future here is not secure,” she said.","1061","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"
"Three years ago, the Yerushalmit Movement attempted to launch a citywide ad campaign featuring only women. After Azaria’s victory in court, the bus company didn’t refuse the campaign, but it did argue that it feared buses would be vandalized, and tried to get the organization to pay an additional fee. After a protracted legal battle, last spring the High Court sided with the Yerushalmit Movement. In October, the organization finally mounted the campaign. It depicts women from every segment of the city’s society. They are all smiling. “Jerusalem women, nice to meet you,” the banners say.","1062","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jerusalem-haredim-women-equality"

Eventually he decided on Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But, before he could offer her the post, Andrew Cuomo called Stephanopoulos. Was it still unfilled? If it was, Andrew said, and if the President offered it, this time the governor would accept. “Mario will do it because the President wants him to,” Andrew said. “But the President really has to put it to him.

I feel that I would abandon what I have to do. I don’t want the President to think that I might say yes.” Stephanopoulos was stunned. Recovering himself, he said, “I have to see the President.

But there is little doubt, and none in my mind, that he would have been a great Justice, one of the half-dozen greatest in the Court’s history.","1073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"
"The breadth and nature of Cuomo’s experience would have impressed his colleagues, even intimidated them a little. He was a son of poor immigrants who never lost their accents; a learned product of public and Catholic schools; a onetime big-league baseball prospect; a spotless paterfamilias; a three-term governor of unblemished integrity; a charismatic leader who twice could have been President had he not let that cup pass from him. Long before he went into politics, Cuomo was a practitioner, professor, expounder, and lover of the law. He was a fine and fluent writer. He was a rigorous reasoner with a sure command of legal subtleties and constitutional principles and a knack for connecting them to the lives of ordinary people and the messy realities of politics and government. Imagine the opinions (and dissents) he might have written! (If you have any doubts on that score, read, reread, skim, or watch his 1984 speech at Notre Dame.) He was also physically imposing—bigger, taller, stronger, and more physically graceful than he seemed at a distance or on television. Back then, such things counted in a workplace as close-in, tradition-dominated, and overwhelmingly male as the chambers of the Supreme Court.","1074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"
"For the first half of his life Cuomo was not a politician. Then he was, emphatically and proudly. No such creature may be found on today’s Court, which is populated entirely by former appellate-court judges with scant experience outside lawyerly pursuits. A Supreme Court Justice who has so much as run for something is a historical rarity; most of the score or so who had ever done so were U.S. Senators. (The current Court’s last former elected official of any kind was the onetime Arizona state senator Sandra Day O’Connor, who won her seat only after being appointed to it to fill a vacancy.) Of the one hundred and twelve Justices since 1789, just four ever headed an executive branch of government: three governors, including Earl Warren, and one President, William Howard Taft. The Court has been the poorer for that lack—the more airless, the more mired in sterile abstraction.","1075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"
"I was lucky enough to become acquainted with Cuomo in early 1976, when I took a break from “The Talk of the Town” to write speeches for New York’s Governor Hugh Carey. Mario was Carey’s “secretary of state,” a dramatically humbler post than its federal homonym. The job left him ample time to shoot the breeze. I dropped in on him as frequently as I could. He was a Vesuvius of ideas and phrases, many of which found their way into Carey’s speeches and, later, Jimmy Carter’s; all I had to do was toss up a topic, listen, and take notes.","1076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"
"We talked on the phone now and then over the years, usually without any particular agenda. An exception was the eve of the filing deadline for the 1992 New Hampshire Presidential primary, when I called to beg him to jump in. He gave me two reasons for staying out. One—that he was unworthy—was maddening. The other—that he had been elected to do the state’s business and had to stay behind and finish up the state budget—was perverse. What were we New Yorkers who had invested our hopes in him, who wanted him to be President, supposed to have done? Were we supposed to have voted against him for governor? And what was a routinely missed fiscal deadline of one state out of fifty compared to the history of the world?","1077","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"
"Like millions of others, I was deeply disappointed when he declined to run. I think he would have been a very good President. But I’ve come to see that there were aspects of him that would have been problematic in the White House. He was no good at delegating authority. His administrative abilities fell well short of his mastery of rhetoric and argument. He was much more interested in ethics, philosophy, and poetry than in economics or political science. He liked to muse—at length. He loved to explore a question at leisure, in depth, endlessly. He preferred the company of old friends, scholars, and populist liberal journalists like Jack Newfield and Jimmy Breslin to that of pols, contributors, and party bigwigs. He didn’t much like to travel. But none of these traits would have done him a bit of harm at the Supreme Court. Some would have helped.","1078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"

"Now, consider some details in Stephanopoulos’s account of the Clinton-Cuomo appointment fiasco. To me, the governor’s yes-I-will-no-I-won’t dithering over the Court, like his dithering over the Presidency, shows that he wanted it, not that he didn’t. He faxes the President that while he has a “duty” to stay in New York, his “desire” is to be on the Court. He makes the preposterously feeble and easily refuted argument that he can somehow render more important “service” by clocking another two or six years in Albany and then doing something else, some unspecified something, than he could by spending the remaining decades of his life on the Supreme Court of the United States, that semi-sovereign institution of almost godlike power. Even after his apparently definitive refusal, Cuomo (via Andrew) invites the President (via Stephanopoulos) to renew the offer. Andrew warns Stephanopoulos that Clinton will have to “use strong language,” that he will have to “tell Mario that he has to do it”—that is, not ask him to. Finally, at the last moment, Mario asks Stephanopoulos to stop Clinton from placing the scheduled call. He didn’t want to face the President directly. Was that because he didn’t want the responsibility of saying no? Or because he didn’t want the responsibility of saying yes?","1091","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"

"The pattern here is similar to Cuomo’s flirtations with running for President. On some level he wanted to be in the White House, but he didn’t want to do what he would have had to do to get there, and he wasn’t sure he would be a success at it. The difference is that he would have had to decide to be President. He would have had to go after it.

"Andrew understood Mario Cuomo’s psychology; Bill Clinton didn’t. This was a case where Clinton needed to be more Johnsonian. Lyndon Johnson knew how to make people do what he wanted them to do, whether they wanted to do it or not. (He put Arthur Goldberg on the Court, which was easy, and then told him get off it, which was hard.) Clinton didn’t need to ask Cuomo. He needed to tell him.

"This isn’t just speculation. Eight or ten years ago—I’m not sure exactly when—Cuomo asked me to lunch at a favorite Italian restaurant near the midtown office of his law firm. Over pasta and red wine, we talked about the news, political and personal. What had he been up to, apart from practicing law? He said that he and another New York political veteran, the former Republican Senator Al d’Amato, had formed a “Crossfire”-style double act, genially debating the issues of the day before conventions of dentists and the like. It was, he said, ridiculously lucrative. He was funny about it, but I thought I detected an undertone of sadness beneath the self-mocking humor. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.","1095","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"
"At length I worked up the courage to ask him what I most wanted to know: Why hadn’t he taken Clinton’s offer? He gave me the familiar answers: he’d owed it to the people of New York to finish the job they’d put him in; there were plenty of available people capable of being superb Justices—Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer were proof of that; there weren’t so many who’d be good governors of New York, and fewer still who could actually get elected. And so on.","1096","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"

"“All right, let me ask you this. What if Clinton had called you? And what if he had said, ‘Governor, this is the President of the United States. Please don’t interrupt me. This is a courtesy call. I want to let you know that in five minutes I am going to the White House press room to announce your nomination as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. This is your duty to your country.

"Cuomo was certainly correct about the excellence of Ruth Bader Ginsburg (who would’ve been Clinton’s second appointment) and Stephen Breyer.

But his accession would have fundamentally changed the dynamic of the Court.","1100","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"
"It’s possible, verging on probable, that some of the lamentable five-to-four decisions of the past twenty years would have turned out differently. That includes the very worst, the worst since the nineteenth century. By the time Bush v. Gore reached the docket, Justice Cuomo would have had seven years to build relationships with his colleagues. His practical experience of elections and election law would have magnified the customary effects of his persuasiveness, intellectual suppleness, wit, and personal magnetism. If just one of the Republican Justices—O’Connor, perhaps—had been coaxed to see beyond party, then a one-vote majority of the Supreme Court might not have nullified the choice of a half-million-vote majority of the electorate. And that in turn would have meant, at a minimum, that William Rehnquist’s successor as Chief Justice would have been an appointee of President Gore—quite likely, Mario Cuomo.","1101","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"
"In 1994, a year and a half after the disastrous Supreme Court pas de deux, Governor Cuomo was defeated for a fourth term. He withdrew almost entirely into private life, and that surely had its profound satisfactions. He was devoted to his wife, Matilda; he had reason to be proud of his sons and daughters; he delighted in his grandchildren. But the “many opportunities of service” he had said he looked forward to never materialized. When he died, aged eighty-two, the cause of death was given as heart failure. One may be forgiven for suspecting that the heart that failed was in some sense broken.","1102","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/mario-cuomo-miscarriage-justice"
"“I’m sitting in Jerry Jones’s box. How do I feel dissed?” New Jersey’s Governor Chris Christie said on “Boomer & Carton,” on WFAN. The hosts, and much of the state of New Jersey, had been analyzing a video clip in which Christie, celebrating a Dallas Cowboys win, had launched himself at Jones, the team’s owner, in a flying hug that resembled a mynock attaching itself to the Millennium Falcon, this time in a luxury box. People might wonder whether the governor of a state whose football alliances are divided, roughly, between the Eagles and the Giants should be bursting with so much affection for Dallas, but Christie doesn’t care—“I would take all the abuse that I’m taking from some of these folks in return for Cowboys playoff wins.” He was also ready to give some credit for the wins to his own big, burnt-orange sweater. He’d happened to wear it to an earlier game, he said, which Dallas won; as a result, “there are some people in my universe who believe that that then becomes a good-luck thing.” He said that the playoff game, against the Detroit Lions, was his fifth this year, and the sweater had a 5-0 record.","January 6, 2015","1103","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/lucky-charms-christies-cowboys-jeb-bushs-pac"

"The striking detail is that, of the five games that Christie attended, at least three were as Jerry Jones’s guest. For the Lions game, the hospitality included a ride on Jones’s private jet. Christie’s spokesman assured reporters that the governor’s trip came “at no expense to New Jersey taxpayers”; that may be exactly the problem. (It’s not clear who paid for Christie’s security team.) Christie’s office insists that it’s O.K. for him to take gifts from Jones, because, as the Wall Street Journal quoted his aides saying, under New Jersey rules, he can accept them from “relatives or personal friends that are paid for with personal funds”—and that he and Jones are actually friends. When, on WFAN, Boomer Esiason raised the question of how much all this cost (“I just want to make sure my gov’s clean”), the governor deflected with an “easy now.” A complication, as the Journal also noted, is that Jones has some financial interests tied to decisions of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which Christie helps to oversee, and which was also the body at the center of Bridgegate, the attempted strangling of Fort Lee with traffic. (Christie has denied that he knew about that plan.) The particular issue is the selection of Legends Hospitality, a company that Jones co-owns, to run the observatory in One World Trade Center. (A Port Authority spokeswoman told the Journal that Legends had been selected in a competitive process.) As Christie sees it, there is nothing instrumental in Jones’s invitations: he’s just crazy about Christie, what with his sweater and his deep Cowboys knowledge. Vanity and venality can be hard to tease apart, but both fit well in the category of poor judgment.","1105","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/lucky-charms-christies-cowboys-jeb-bushs-pac"
"There are few forces in Christie’s political life more toxic than his insistence on his own lovability. It is coupled with a snapping insistence on the pettiness of anyone who questions him. “We all know what this is about,” he said on “Boomer & Carton.” According to him, no one minded that he was a Dallas fan when the team wasn’t doing well—the hostility only emerged when the Cowboys started to win. People are just jealous. He also told the story about how he followed Jones’s victory progression down to the locker room, where, he said, the first hand he shook was that of wide receiver Dez Bryant—”Dez knows exactly who I am.” Sure he does: he’s a guest of Bryant’s boss, and a man who wants to be President.","1106","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/lucky-charms-christies-cowboys-jeb-bushs-pac"
"Christie is not alone, either in his ambitions or his open appeals for love. Congress opens Tuesday, giving potential candidates—Senators Paul, Cruz, Rubio, and maybe even Warren, on the other side—a place to play. But some of the non-legislators in contention have had a busy week, too, in ways that illustrate the disorder in the G.O.P., and the potential for unhinged theatricality in 2016. Watching Mike Huckabee announce that he was leaving his Fox News show to explore a run, one feared he might burst into song (he’s done it before), and turn a statement already overfilled with praise for Roger Ailes, his Fox boss, and the shared principles of everyone at the channel, into some sort of ballad. Huckabee’s news comes two weeks before the publication of his next book, “God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy,” and it might be tempting to dismiss this all as more of a marketing than a political campaign, if not for three things: Huckabee did do surprisingly well in 2008; his far-conservative positions, laced with the language of faith; appeal to a strong strain within the G.O.P., giving him the chance to gain primary votes and, at least, influence the direction of debates; and, perhaps most confoundingly, someone does have to win the Republican nomination.

"Odder still is the designation of Jeb Bush as the rock of the field, the establishment candidate. This is a story of family love, both real and presumed. His parents have always made it clear that they thought he was the most Presidential of their children, which, given that his brother got and mishandled the job, may explain why it’s sometimes hard to tell whether Jeb is grinning or pouting. But is there public affection for the idea of another Bush? On New Year’s Eve, Jeb’s office announced that he was resigning from various boards and paid advisory positions and was also, as the Washington Post put it, “reviewing other businesses in which he is principal partner or owner.” Some of those, like Britton Hill, have been collecting investors quite recently, and there are questions about his finances dating back to his father’s Presidency. (It might help, as I’ve written before, that Hillary Clinton has some of the same negatives, in terms of nepotism and money.) The arrival of gay marriage in Florida left Jeb wriggling, or, rather, undulating, as he tried out lines that would keep intact both his conservative credentials and his image as a moderate. (He started with states’ rights and then alighted on the “rule of law,” meaning that county clerks should not openly defy the courts, as some had suggested they might. And on Tuesday he launched a leadership PAC, a vehicle for getting and giving out political money. It’s called the Right to Rise PAC, and its logo is what looks like a dismembered arm extended toward a star, suggesting either free-floating ambition or a man drowning on the high seas. But maybe, in Jeb’s universe, it’s a good-luck thing.","1108","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/lucky-charms-christies-cowboys-jeb-bushs-pac"

"One morning in September, Lissette Castrillón, a caseworker in Providence, Rhode Island, drove to an apartment on the western edge of town to visit Annie Rodriguez, a young mother, and her two-year-old daughter, Eilen. Castrillón and Rodriguez sat down on a worn rug and spoke about the importance of talking to very young children. They discussed ways to cajole a toddler into an extended conversation, and identified moments in the day when Rodriguez could be chatting more with Eilen, an ebullient little girl who was wearing polka-dot leggings.","1111","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Whenever she’s saying a few new words, it’s important to tell her yes, and add to it,” Castrillón told Rodriguez. “So if she sees a car you can say, ‘Yes, that’s a car. It’s a big car. It’s a blue car.’ ”","1112","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"

"Castrillón looked at her and said, “Right! Blue car! Good job!”","1114","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Rodriguez noted that Eilen had recently become so enthralled by an animated show, “Bubble Guppies,” that she had become “stuck on that word ‘guppy.’ ” She went on, “Everything’s ‘guppy, guppy, guppy.’ So when she refers to something as ‘guppy’ I try to correct it—like, ‘No, that’s not a guppy. That’s a doll.’ ”","1115","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Guppy?” Eilen said, hopefully.","1116","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Castrillón said, “Well, I think right now the important thing won’t be so much telling her no but just adding words and repeating them, so she’ll start repeating them on her own.”","1117","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Rodriguez is enrolled in a program called Providence Talks, the most ingenious of several new programs across the country that encourage low-income parents to talk more frequently with their kids. Once a month, Eilen wears a small recording device for the day, and the recording is then analyzed. An algorithm tallies all the words spoken by adults in her vicinity, all the vocalizations Eilen makes, and all the “conversational turns”—exchanges in which Eilen says something and an adult replies, or vice versa. The caseworker who visits Rodriguez’s home gives her a progress report, which shows in graph form how many words Eilen has been hearing, and how they peak and dip throughout the day.","1118","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Castrillón presented Rodriguez with the month’s report. She leaned over her shoulder and said, “See, this shows the percentage of adult words. There were over fifteen thousand words spoken in that day.”","1119","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Wow!” Rodriguez said.","1120","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Castrillón noted that significantly more conversation took place when the TV was off, and that it had been off more that month than the previous one. “There was pretty high electronic sound last time,” she said. “This time, there was very little.” Rodriguez nodded, studying the printout.","1121","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"In the nineteen-eighties, two child psychologists at the University of Kansas, Betty Hart and Todd Risley, began comparing, in detail, how parents of different social classes talked with their children. Hart and Risley had both worked in preschool programs designed to boost the language skills of low-income kids, but they had been dissatisfied with the results of such efforts: the achievement gap between rich and poor had continued to widen. They decided to look beyond the classroom and examine what went on inside the home. Hart and Risley recruited forty-two families: thirteen upper, or “professional,” class, ten middle class, thirteen working class, and six on welfare. Each family had a baby who was between seven and twelve months old. During the next two and a half years, observers visited each home for an hour every month, and taped the encounters. They were like dinner guests who never said much but kept coming back.","1122","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"In all, Hart and Risley reported, they analyzed “more than 1,300 hours of casual interactions between parents and their language-learning children.” The researchers noticed many similarities among the families: “They all disciplined their children and taught them good manners and how to dress and toilet themselves.” They all showed their children affection and said things like “Don’t jump on the couch” and “Use your spoon” and “Do you have to go potty?” But the researchers also found that the wealthier parents consistently talked more with their kids. Among the professional families, the average number of words that children heard in an hour was twenty-one hundred and fifty; among the working-class families, it was twelve hundred and fifty; among the welfare families, it was six hundred and twenty. Over time, these daily differences had major consequences, Hart and Risley concluded: “With few exceptions, the more parents talked to their children, the faster the children’s vocabularies were growing and the higher the children’s I.Q. test scores at age 3 and later.”","1123","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Hart and Risley’s research has grown in prominence, in part because large-scale educational reforms like No Child Left Behind have proved disappointing. Addressing the word gap by coaching new parents sounds like a simpler intervention. Last year, Hillary Clinton announced a new initiative, Too Small to Fail, that emphasizes the importance of talking to infants and young children; in the fall, President Barack Obama convened a White House conference whose goal was to “bridge the word gap and put more young people on the path to success.” Other cities, including Cambridge, Massachusetts, have initiated programs similar to the one in Providence, and still others have begun public-awareness campaigns with radio spots and bus-shelter signs reminding parents to talk frequently to their kids. The notion of the word gap even turned up on “Orange Is the New Black,” when one of the inmates urged her boyfriend to talk with their new daughter, because “there’s all these studies that say that if you don’t talk to the baby they end up, like, fucked by the time they’re five.”","1124","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"The way you converse with your child is one of the most intimate aspects of parenting, shaped both by your personality and by cultural habits so deep that they can feel automatic. Changing how low-income parents interact with their children is a delicate matter, and not especially easy. Lissette Castrillón was sensitive to the challenge, and she had an appealing informality: she listened carefully to Rodriguez, praised her efforts, and said admiring things about Eilen, all while sitting cross-legged on the floor. But, perhaps inevitably, there was an awkward moment.","1125","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Castrillón had brought an iPad with her, and she played for Rodriguez a video of a mother shopping at the grocery store while her toddler sat in the cart—just to show, Castrillón explained, that you could “talk aloud when you’re pretty much doing anything.” The mother onscreen was blond and fit, and wore white jeans; she looked like a character in a Nancy Meyers movie, and her patter was so constant that it became wearying. “Here’s our crunchy peanut butter, sweetheart!” she trilled, scanning an aisle filled with organic food. “Here’s the Wild Oats one. Roasted almond butter. Crunchy. Let’s get crunchy, Bubba.” The cart was piled high, and the items looked expensive. “Bubba, we’re running out of room. What are we going to do? Did Mommy buy too many groceries today? I think we should get the creamy, too, because Murphy does not like when I get that crunchy. And we like to have the peanut butter because peanut butter’s good for you. It’s got protein.”","1126","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Rodriguez watched the video with a serious expression. It was hard to imagine her holding forth with such preening gusto in the organics aisle. Castrillón said, “Well, you know, just—whatever the food is you’re buying, you can talk about color, shape, and texture.”","1127","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"In 2012, the mayor of Providence, Angel Taveras, heard about the Mayors Challenge, a new competition being offered to cities that proposed a bold idea for making urban life better. The prize was to be given by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the foundation started by Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, on the premise that cities are “the new laboratories of democracy.” The city that won the grand prize would receive five million dollars to realize its project, and four other cities would be given a million each. As Taveras recalled, “They announced that challenge on Twitter, and right away I said, ‘We’re going to go for it.’ And I didn’t know exactly what it would be at the time, but I knew it was going to be on early-childhood education.”","1128","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Taveras’s focus was not unusual: these days, everyone from preschool teachers to politicians talks about infant brain development, and toy companies tap into parental anxiety about it. But Taveras had a personal investment in the subject. He is the son of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, neither of whom went beyond the eighth grade. He grew up in Providence, and his mother, Amparo, who raised him largely on her own, worked factory jobs to support him and his two siblings. When he was four, Amparo enrolled him in a local Head Start program, and he felt that it had made a decisive difference in his life. He went on to Providence public schools, and then attended Harvard University and Georgetown law school. Taveras calls himself the “Head Start to Harvard” mayor, and he still has his graduation picture from the program. “I wore a cap and gown, and it was so special for me,” he recalled.","1129","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"In 2010, at the age of forty, Taveras became the first Latino mayor of Providence, a city that is nineteen per cent Latino, mostly Dominican. Tall and skinny, with rimless eyeglasses, Taveras is nerdier and nicer than you might expect of a Providence mayor. One of his predecessors, Buddy Cianci, was twice convicted of felonies while in office: once for racketeering, and once for assaulting a man—using a lit cigarette and a fireplace log—who was dating his ex-wife. Taveras, by contrast, wrote a children’s book called “How to Do Well in School” and seems genuinely to enjoy mayoral duties like dropping in for “story time” at a local library.","1130","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"One day, while Taveras was mulling over what to propose for the Bloomberg competition, his policy director, Toby Shepherd, told him about Hart and Risley’s research—including their calculation that a poor four-year-old has heard thirty million fewer words from his parents than a wealthy one has.","1131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"That number had attracted a lot of attention in the press—to the point that Hart and Risley’s study was sometimes faulted for an overemphasis on the sheer quantity of words. But Taveras learned that Hart, who died in 2012, and Risley, who died in 2007, had also identified important differences in kinds of talk. In the recordings of the professional families, they found a “greater richness of nouns, modifiers, and past-tense verbs,” and more conversations on subjects that children had initiated. Catherine Snow, a professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, who studies children’s language development, told me that these findings made sense, since quantity was often a proxy for quality. “Families that talk a lot also talk about more different things,” Snow said. “They use more grammatical variety in their sentences and more sophisticated vocabulary, and produce more utterances in connected chains.” Such parents, she noted, “don’t just say, ‘That’s a teapot.’ They say, ‘Oh, look, a teapot! Let’s have a tea party! There’s Raggedy Ann—do you think she wants to come to our tea party? Does she like sugar in her tea?’ ” Parents who talk a lot with their young children ask them many questions, including ones to which they know the answer. (“Is that a ducky on your shirt?”) They reply to those devilish “Why?” questions toddlers love with elaborate explanations. Erika Hoff, a developmental psychologist at Florida Atlantic University, has published studies about early language development whose results are similar to those of Hart and Risley. She recalled marvelling at “the young professor mothers” at a university childcare center: “Everything was a topic of conversation. If they had to get out of the building in case of a fire, they’d be so busy discussing the pros and cons with their toddlers that I kind of wondered if they’d make it.”","1132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Among the more affluent families studied by Hart and Risley, a higher proportion of the talk directed at children was affirming, which was defined to include not just compliments like “Good job!” but also responses in which parents repeat and build on a child’s comments: “Yes, it is a bunny! It’s a bunny eating a carrot!” In those families, the average child heard thirty-two affirmations and five prohibitions (“Stop that”; “That’s the wrong way!”) per hour—a ratio of six to one. For the kids in the working-class families, the ratio was twelve affirmatives to seven prohibitions, and in the welfare families it was five affirmatives to eleven prohibitions. Hart and Risley included one extended description of a mother from the poorest group, at home with her twenty-three-month-old daughter, Inge:","1133","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Hart and Risley noted that the mother was “concerned” and “affectionate” toward her child. Inge was dressed in nice clothes and fed consistently, and she was toilet trained; at one point, the mother picked her up and kissed her. But she made “few efforts to engage the child in conversation,” and did not “re-direct” Inge when she wanted her to stop doing something, or treat exploratory misbehavior as a sign of curiosity rather than defiance. Most of what the mother said to Inge was “corrective or critical.”","1134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Hart and Risley also provided examples of various kinds of conversation—mostly, but not exclusively, among the professional families—in which parents prompted and encouraged children to talk:","1135","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Mayor Taveras thought that such conversational strategies could be taught to new parents, and decided to address the word-gap problem with the Mayors Challenge. “Head Start is awesome,” he told me. “But we’ve gotta do something even before Head Start.” At the time, his wife was pregnant with their first child, and he “was reading and talking to my daughter in utero. I decided it can’t hurt. I’d come home and say, ‘It’s Daddy,’ and ‘How are you?,’ and everything else.”","1136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Even though the Hart and Risley study had encompassed just a few dozen families, the transcribing and coding of all those tapes had been laborious. New technology, Shepherd told him, could make counting words much easier. In 2005, a research foundation named LENA (for Language Environment Analysis) had developed a small digital device that could record for sixteen hours and recognize adult words, child vocalizations, and conversational turns. Such distinctions were important, because researchers had determined that merely overheard speech—a mother holding a child on her lap but talking on the phone, for instance—contributed less to language development. The LENA recorder could also distinguish between actual people speaking in a child’s earshot and sounds from TVs and other electronic devices; children under the age of two appear to learn language only from other humans. The device was about the size of an iPod, and it fit into the pocket of a specially designed vest or pair of overalls. (Children soon forgot about the devices, though they occasionally ended up in the toilet or in the dog’s bed.)","1137","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"LENA’s device had been used in academic research on language development and in interventions for hard-of-hearing, autistic, and developmentally delayed children. In 2009, a Chicago surgeon named Dana Suskind, who specializes in cochlear-implant surgery for deaf children, began using LENA’s technology in a program called the Thirty Million Words Initiative, which includes a study on the effects of encouraging low-income parents to talk more with their children. Suskind had come across Hart and Risley’s research after noticing divergent outcomes for her young patients. “Cochlear implants are truly a modern medical miracle,” she said. “But, after the implantation surgery, some of the kids we saw were reading and speaking on grade level, and others were much slower to communicate. The difference almost always had to do with socioeconomic status.”","1138","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Taveras named his proposed project Providence Talks, and decided that technology would be supported with counselling. During home visits with low-income parents, caseworkers would discuss the science of early brain development. They’d advise parents to try to understand better what their kids were feeling, instead of simply saying no. Parents would be told that, even when they were bathing a child or cooking dinner, they could be narrating what was going on, as well as singing, counting, and asking questions. The caseworkers would bring books and demonstrate how to read them: asking children questions about what was going to happen next and livening up the dialogue with funny, high-pitched voices and enthusiastic mooing and woofing.","1139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"For the mayor, it was important that Providence Talks did not seem exclusive. “I love it that you can do this in Spanish or any other language,” he said. “I love it that you can do it even if you’re not literate. Even if you can’t read them a book. You can still talk to them about what an apple is: ‘This is a red apple, this is a green apple, this is how you cut it.’ Just talking and engaging and having a conversation.”","1140","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"In March of 2013, Taveras learned that Providence Talks had won the Mayors Challenge grand prize. The Bloomberg committee praised the city for its “direct, simple, and revolutionary approach.” Taveras wanted to jump up and down and scream, but, fearing that this wasn’t mayoral, he contented himself with fist-bumping Toby Shepherd and the rest of his staff.","1141","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"A big part of the program’s appeal lay in its technology. Using LENA devices, caseworkers could show parents how much they’d been talking at various times of the day. Crucially, parents found the gadgets fun: they were like Fitbits for conversation. Andrea Riquetti, the director of Providence Talks, told me, “The fact that we have this report, in a graph form, makes it nonjudgmental.” Parents were likely to resist, she felt, if the program seemed scolding. “We can say, look, here’s the data. Look how much you were talking at eleven o’clock! How can we do this for another half hour? As opposed to a home visitor telling a parent, ‘You’re not talking to your child enough.’ ”","1142","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Providence Talks had its critics, some of whom thought that the program seemed too intrusive. The A.C.L.U. raised questions about what would happen to the recordings, and one of the organization’s Rhode Island associates, Hillary Davis, told National Journal, “There’s always a concern when we walk in with technology into lower-income families, immigrant populations, minority populations, and we say, ‘This will help you.’ ” She continued, “We don’t necessarily recognize the threat to their own safety or liberty that can accidentally come along with that.”","1143","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Others charged that Providence Talks was imposing middle-class cultural values on poorer parents who had their own valid approaches to raising children, and argued that the program risked faulting parents for their children’s academic shortcomings while letting schools off the hook. Nobody contested the fact that, on average, low-income children entered kindergarten with fewer scholastic skills than kids who were better off, but there were many reasons for the disparity, ranging from poor nutrition to chaotic living conditions to the absence of a preschool education. In a caustic essay titled “Selling the Language Gap,” which was published in Anthropology News, Susan Blum, of Notre Dame, and Kathleen Riley, of Fordham, called Providence Talks an example of “silver-bullet thinking,” the latest in a long history of “blame-the-victim approaches to language and poverty.”","1144","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"To some scholars, the program’s emphasis on boosting numbers made it seem as though the quality of conversation didn’t matter much. As James Morgan, a developmental psycholinguist at Brown University, put it, obsessive word counting might lead parents to conclude that “saying ‘doggy, doggy, doggy, doggy’ is more meaningful than saying ‘doggy.’ ” Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a psychologist at Temple University, told me that Hart and Risley had “done a very important piece of work that pointed to a central problem”; nevertheless, their findings had often been interpreted glibly, as if the solution were to let words “just wash over a child, like the background noise of a TV.” Her own research, including a recent paper written with Lauren Adamson and other psychologists, points to the importance of interactions between parents and children in which they are both paying attention to the same thing—a cement mixer on the street, a picture in a book—and in which the ensuing conversation (some of which might be conducted in gestures) is fluid and happens over days, even weeks. “It’s not just serve and return,” Hirsh-Pasek said. “It’s serve and return—and return and return.”","1145","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"The original Hart and Risley research, whose data set had only six families in the poorest category, was also called into question. Mark Liberman, a linguist at the University of Pennsylvania, said, “Do low-income people talk with their kids less? Well, that’s a question about millions of people. Think of people in the survey business, trying to predict elections or develop a marketing campaign. They would find it laughable to draw conclusions without a large randomized sample.” Encouraging adults to talk more to children was all to the good, Liberman said, but it was important to remember that “there are some wealthy people who don’t talk to their children much and some poor people who talk a lot.”","1146","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Indeed, recent research that supports Hart and Risley’s work has found a great deal of variability within classes. In 2006, researchers at the LENA Foundation recorded the conversations of three hundred and twenty-nine families, who were divided into groups by the mothers’ education level, a reasonable proxy for social class. Like Hart and Risley, the LENA researchers determined that, on average, parents who had earned at least a B.A. spoke more around their children than other parents: 14,926 words per day versus 12,024. (They attributed Hart and Risley’s bigger gap to the fact that they had recorded families only during the late afternoon and the evening—when families talk most—and extrapolated.) But the LENA team also found that some of the less educated parents spoke a lot more than some of the highly educated parents.","1147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Anne Fernald, a psychologist at Stanford, has published several papers examining the influence of socioeconomic status on children’s language development. In one recent study, Fernald, with a colleague, Adriana Weisleder, and others, identified “large disparities” among socioeconomic groups in “infants’ language processing, speech production, and vocabulary.” But they also found big differences among working-class families, both in terms of “the children’s language proficiency and the parents’ verbal engagement with the child.” Fernald, who sits on the scientific advisory board for Providence Talks, told me, “Some of the wealthiest families in our research had low word counts, possibly because they were on their gadgets all day. So you can see an intermingling at the extremes of rich and poor. Socioeconomic status is not destiny.”","1148","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"In response to the privacy concerns, Mayor Taveras and his team volunteered their own households to be the first ones recorded. They also guaranteed that the LENA Foundation’s software would erase the recordings after the algorithm analyzed the data. Though this probably reassured some families, it also disappointed some scholars. “That’s a huge amount of data being thrown out!” James Morgan, of Brown, told me. “There were real concerns whether families would participate otherwise. But as a scientist it breaks my heart.”","1149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"To those who argued that Providence Talks embodied cultural imperialism, staff members responded that, on the contrary, they were “empowering” parents with knowledge. Andrea Riquetti, the Providence Talks director, told me, “It really is our responsibility to let families know what it takes to succeed in the culture they live in. Which may not necessarily be the same as the culture they have. But it’s their choice whether they decide to. It’s not a case of our saying, ‘You have to do this.’ ” Riquetti grew up in Quito, Ecuador, came to America at the age of seventeen, and worked for many years as a kindergarten teacher in Providence schools. In Latino culture, she said, “the school is seen as being in charge of teaching children their letters and all that, while parents are in charge of discipline—making sure they listen and they’re good and they sit still. Parents don’t tend, overall, to give children a lot of choices and options. It’s kind of like ‘I rule the roost so that you can behave and learn at school.’ ” The Providence Talks approach “is a little more like ‘No, your child and what they have to say is really important.’ And having them feel really good about themselves as opposed to passive about their learning is important, because that’s what’s going to help them succeed in this culture.”","1150","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Riquetti and the Providence Talks team didn’t seem troubled by the concerns that Hart and Risley’s data set wasn’t robust enough. Although no subsequent study has found a word gap as large as thirty million, several of them have found that children in low-income households have smaller vocabularies than kids in higher-income ones. This deficit correlates with the quantity and the quality of talk elicited by the adults at home, and becomes evident quite early—in one study, when some kids were eighteen months old. Lack of conversation wasn’t the only reason that low-income kids started out behind in school, but it was certainly a problem.","1151","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"The biggest question was whether Providence Talks could really change something as personal, casual, and fundamental as how people talk to their babies. Erika Hoff, of Florida Atlantic University, told me, “In some ways, parenting behavior clearly can change. I have a daughter who has a baby now and she does everything differently from how I did it—putting babies to sleep on their backs, not giving them milk till they’re a year old. But patterns of interacting are different. You’re trying to get people to change something that seems natural to them and comes from a fairly deep place. I don’t know how malleable that is.”","1152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"After decades of failed educational reforms, few policymakers are naïve enough to believe that a single social intervention could fully transform disadvantaged children’s lives. The growing economic inequality in America is too entrenched, too structural. But that’s hardly an argument for doing nothing. Although improvements in test scores associated with preschool programs fade as students proceed through elementary school, broader benefits can be seen many years later. A few oft-cited studies have shown that low-income kids who attended high-quality preschool programs were more likely to graduate from high school and less likely to become pregnant as teen-agers or to be incarcerated; they also earned more money, on average, than peers who were not in such programs. Such data suggest that a full assessment of Providence Talks will take decades to complete.","1153","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"On a cool, rainy morning in April, I went on a home visit with a young caseworker named Stephanie Taveras (no relation to the mayor), who had been assigned to Providence Talks. Two months earlier, the program had begun with fifty-eight families; the plan was to start adding many more families in the fall, with a projected, if optimistic, enrollment of two thousand families. The monthly recording and coaching visits would go on for two years. On earlier visits, Taveras had discussed a baby’s cognitive development by bringing a little wax model of a brain with her.","1154","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"The family lived in an apartment in Southside, on a block of small, scrubby lawns, chain-link fences, and two-story wooden houses. It was a predominantly Latino neighborhood, where a third of the families have incomes below the poverty line. On a nearby street, there was a corner shop, Perla del Caribe, and a meat market, El Vecinos, but there was no one out on the street that morning, and it felt a little desolate.","1155","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Inside, Taveras greeted a seven-month-old girl, Skylah, who was smiling and gurgling while propped up in an ExerSaucer. Skylah’s parents, Maranda Raposo and Nicholas Mailloux, were seated on a couch in a gray-carpeted living room whose walls were mostly bare. In one corner, a cat was curled up. In another, a TV was showing an episode of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.”","1156","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Raposo, who was twenty-one, had long, magenta-tinted hair pulled back in a ponytail. She smiled sweetly but was soft-spoken and reticent with her guests. She had dropped out of high school when she was a freshman, after she got pregnant with her first child, Isabella, who was now five. Raposo was hoping to get her G.E.D., but in the meantime she was working two part-time jobs as a cashier, at Party City and at Sears. Mailloux, who was twenty-five and had a five-year-old son by a former girlfriend, was staying home with the kids. Raposo told me later that she had been willing to try Providence Talks because “it was something we could experience with Skylah—it could bring us closer as a family.” Just as she and Mailloux wanted to help Skylah stand out by giving her a name with an unusual spelling, they wanted to feel that the time they spent with her was special. “Some people don’t even bother talking to their kids,” Raposo said. “We talk to her.” Nevertheless, before enrolling in the program she hadn’t known “exactly how important that is.”","1157","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Taveras plopped down on the floor and, like Mary Poppins with her carpet bag, started pulling items out of her satchel. She handed Mailloux a board book, “Peek-a Who?,” and he put Skylah on his lap and started reading it to her: “Who do you think it’s gonna be?” Skylah patted the book and giggled.","1158","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Taveras showed them graphs generated by the previous month’s recording, noting that their words and conversational turns had gone down a bit. “I went to the nail salon that day,” Raposo recalled. “Everybody was talking to her, but she was just, like, staring.”","1159","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“She wasn’t in a talking mood that day,” Mailloux added.","1160","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“That happens,” Taveras reassured them. “What’s important is that you challenge yourself to do better the next time.” At one point, she asked, “Are there particular times of the day when you read to her? How many times a day, would you say?”","1161","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Both parents seemed a little vague on this point. After a moment, Raposo said, “We try to do it more than once.”","1162","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Taveras asked them what they thought Skylah was learning when they read to her.","1163","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Colors, shapes, animals,” Raposo said.","1164","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Yes, and also she’s learning about relationships,” Taveras said. “You’re teaching her that she’s important to you. You’re making her feel good about herself.” Both parents nodded. “And educational skills, too. When she gets to school, she’s gonna already be used to sitting still and paying attention.”","1165","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Taveras told them, “Babies at this age like books with large photos, bright pictures, simple drawings, and familiar things.” She recommended board books, noting, “Paper books she’s gonna want to tear and chew.”","1166","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Taveras then offered some thoughts on how to read a book to a baby: “It’s a four-part interaction. Get your book, point to something in the book—‘Look, Skylah, a ball!’—ask a labelling question—‘What’s that? That’s a cow! Moo! Can you say moo?’—and acknowledge her response. Like, if she babbles or makes a noise, make it back to her, so she knows you heard her. And, if you correct, do it positively. If you say, ‘What’s that?,’ and she says, ‘A dog,’ you could say, ‘It looks like a dog,’ or ‘It’s brown like the dog, but it’s a monkey!’ That makes her feel good. Not just ‘No,’ or ‘No, that’s a monkey.’ ”","1167","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Raposo nodded again, but she seemed most comfortable quietly watching Taveras, who remained on the floor, singing and clapping with Skylah.","1168","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Though cultural factors may well explain why some low-income parents talk relatively little with their toddlers, the most obvious explanation is poverty itself. When daily life is stressful and uncertain and dispiriting, it can be difficult to summon up the patience and the playfulness for an open-ended conversation with a small, persistent, possibly whiny child. In 2007, Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, helped establish a campaign in Boston that urged parents to talk to their kids, and he organized focus groups with low-income parents. “You had some people working three jobs or dealing with the steady drizzle of helplessness and hopelessness,” he recalled. “That makes it hard to have vibrant conversations with a baby. They’d say, ‘Look, when I get home I have to clean and cook and do the laundry.’ They’re exhausted. They’d say, ‘Sometimes we have to put our kids in front of the TV.’ ” Weissbourd said of interventions like Providence Talks, “Maybe we have the model wrong. Maybe what we need to do is come in and bring dinner and help with laundry and free up a parent to engage in more play with their child.”","1169","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Patricia Kuhl, a co-director of the Institute for Learning and Brain Science at the University of Washington, has studied “motherese,” the brightly inflected talk that mothers, whatever their native language, direct at their babies, and that babies love. (Fathers and other adults, of course, are equally capable of saying “Sooooo big!” in a singsong voice.) Kuhl told me, “Motherese, when you combine that with being one on one with a baby, is dynamite for language development.” Parents are paying full attention, speaking in that high, lilting voice for maximum reaction, giving babies a chance to babble and coo back. But, Kuhl added, “Motherese is, by nature, happy talk. If you’re stressed or depressed, it can be hard to get into that mode.”","1170","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Then, too, some parents may not see the point of talking to babies, who can’t yet speak, or even of talking much to toddlers, who do, but sometimes unintelligibly. Andrea Riquetti told me, “I think educated people are more aware of the importance of communication and interaction and language.” In some families, she said, “if a baby’s really ‘good’ they get to spend a lot of time alone in their crib.”","1171","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"When I asked myself why I had talked a lot with my babies—and had read aloud favorite picture books to the point that I could recite them from memory—I realized that I hadn’t been driven mainly by knowledge of brain development or by pedagogical intent. It was just that talking made the daily labor of mothering more interesting. Long stretches of time with toddlers can be boring, and the unavoidable moments when you admonished and corrected them were, to me, the dullest. It was more fun if you satisfied your own intellectual curiosity along with theirs: reading books about African animals or Chinese New Year celebrations; trying to remember why the sky is blue; honing age-appropriate arguments for eating your carrots.","1172","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"When a family places a very high value on discipline and respect for parental authority, there is often disapproval of talking back, which can inhibit conversation in general. To some extent, this attitude tracks with class, perhaps because many working-class parents, consciously or not, are preparing children for jobs and lives in which they will not have a lot of power or autonomy. The sociologist Annette Lareau, in her classic 2003 study, “Unequal Childhoods,” interviewed the parents of eighty-eight nine- and ten-year-old children, then closely followed twelve of these families in order to compare the child-rearing styles of middle-class parents with those of poor and working-class parents. The middle-class families she observed practiced what she called “concerted cultivation”: enrolling kids in various organized activities led by adults, but also engaging even young kids in a lot of back-and-forth conversation with adults. Working-class and poor families favored an “accomplishment of natural growth” approach. Their children’s lives were less customized to their preferences or to their parents’ notions of how to develop their particular talents; discipline came in the form of directives and, sometimes, threats of physical punishment; talk was less extensive and less geared toward drawing out a child’s opinions.","1173","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"When I asked Lareau, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, about the language aspect of her research, she said, “The class differences in the amount of speech inside the families really surprised me.” She recalled that a white working-class girl in her study once brought up a weighty spiritual matter with her parents: “We were sitting in their completely comfortable, pleasant living room. The girl was all excited. She said, ‘Do you know what a mortal sin is?’ The parents said, ‘You tell us.’ They listened to her answer, said nothing in reply, and went back to watching TV.”","1174","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"In middle-class families, Lareau frequently witnessed the kind of verbal jousting between parents and children that gives kids a certain intellectual confidence. One upper-middle-class African-American family she spent time with—Terry, a trial lawyer; his wife, Christina, a corporate executive; and their nine-year-old son, Alexander—was especially fond of these kinds of debate. In one conversation, Terry playfully challenged his son to defend his list of favorite cars: “Last time, you said the Miata, the Mercedes, and the Bugatti. Which one is it?” Alex replied, “This is America. It’s my prerogative to change my mind if I want to.”","1175","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Lareau did not see the middle-class approach as inherently superior. “The amount of talk in those households is exhausting,” she said. “It involves a lot of labor on the parents’ part, and sometimes parents are really not enjoying it. Sometimes kids use their verbal acuity to be really mean to each other.” She often found the kids in poor and working-class families to be more polite to their elders, less whiny, more competent, and more independent than their middle-class counterparts. Still, Lareau concluded, the kind of talk that prevailed in middle-class households offered better preparation for success in school and in professional careers. It taught children to debate, extemporize, and advocate for themselves, and it helped them develop the vocabulary that tends to reap academic rewards.","1176","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"James Morgan, the Brown University linguist, told me, “If you’re mainly confined to ‘Eat your food,’ ‘Chew every bite,’ there are going to be fewer words heard at the dinner table. As opposed to starting a conversation with ‘Hey, did you hear the blue whales are making a comeback off California?,’ or ‘Oh, they just discovered a huge new dinosaur.’ And, after all, almost all little kids are interested in subjects like that.”","1177","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Asking such questions often depends on having an education. But it’s not just the topics—it’s the mode of inquiry. Anne Fernald said, “As an educated mother, you have more experience with teacher talk, which is necessarily more abstract, because kids don’t share common ground when they come to school. Education helps you learn how to make yourself clear to people who are outside your point of view.”","1178","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Last summer, I returned to Providence to see how the campaign was working for the families I’d met in April. Andrea Riquetti, the program director, and Stephanie Taveras, the caseworker, took me back to the home of Maranda Raposo and Nicholas Mailloux. Skylah was now ten months old, and even more adorable, but the latest data were disappointing: the number of conversational turns and the over-all word count weren’t as high as Taveras would have liked to see.","1179","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Mailloux told her, “As soon as that vest goes on, she quiets down.”","1180","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Are you onto us, Skylah?” Taveras asked, smiling.","1181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Mailloux pointed to an uptick on the chart. “I sang to her at ten o’clock.”","1182","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Look at that!” Taveras said.","1183","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Raposo’s older daughter, Isabella, was sitting on Mailloux’s lap, watching the Disney Channel. Skylah crawled over to her and bopped her gleefully with the remote control.","1184","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Stop being so mean!” Raposo told her.","1185","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Riquetti stepped in to offer a benign interpretation of Skylah’s behavior: “She’s saying, ‘Pay attention to me.’ ” Soon afterward, Skylah, grinning, dropped the remote control, and the batteries rolled under the couch. “This is the age where they’re trying to see how gravity works,” Riquetti explained. The remote was put back together and the TV was turned off. “It’s cause and effect. She’s trying to make you—”","1186","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Work,” Raposo said.","1187","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Riquetti laughed sympathetically, then asked her how much time they spent reading with Skylah. Raposo answered firmly: thirty minutes a day.","1188","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"The TV was back on again. Riquetti had told me that asking families to leave the set off could seem intrusive and high-handed. The staff at Providence Talks had hoped that, once parents saw data showing how much less conversation took place when the TV was on, they would leave it off more often. But the habit wasn’t so easy to break.","1189","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"On this visit, both parents seemed more attuned to Skylah’s efforts to express herself, and more confident in their efforts to guide her. It was hard to say if this was because Skylah was older and more vocal or because Providence Talks had taught them to interact with her in richer ways. When I asked them about the change, Mailloux gave the program credit. “It helps us learn more of how she understands things and reacts to them,” he said. “And . . .” He paused, flustered. “I don’t know how to put it into words. It’s in my head, but it won’t come out.”","1190","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"As part of the visit, Taveras was going through a developmental checklist for Skylah. One of the questions was “Does she express pleasure and displeasure?”","1191","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Both parents nodded vigorously. “If there’s something she doesn’t want, she screams and throws it,” Raposo said. “It’s so funny.”","1192","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Does she play with sounds, like vocal play?” Taveras asked. They nodded.","1193","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“What do you do when she does that?”","1194","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Copy it,” Mailloux said.","1195","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"“Perfect.”","1196","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Raposo picked up a board book that contained pictures of animals. “Where’s the mouse?” She took Skylah’s finger and gently placed it on the correct image. “Right there!” she said, in motherese.","1197","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Mailloux pointed to a picture of a messy room in the book. “That looks like your brother and sister’s room, doesn’t it?” he joked.","1198","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Riquetti said, “You’re pointing and labelling and talking to her constantly. It’s great. It’s so important that you do what you do. You’re making her smart when you talk to her.”","1199","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Mailloux looked a little sheepish. “It’s out of respect,” he told Riquetti. “You guys do your part, and we gotta do ours.”","1200","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"In Angel Taveras’s proposal to Bloomberg Philanthropies, he promised that Providence Talks would have a research component. Its results would be monitored and studied by a Brown University professor of educational policy, Kenneth Wong. The results of that study won’t be published for some time, since the interventions are supposed to last for two years, and Providence Talks is only now expanding from its original pilot study of fifty-eight families. But there had been some analysis of the data from the first families, and Rob Horowitz, a spokesman for Providence Talks, told me, “We are seeing early but promising preliminary results. More specifically, families that started with low word counts are showing increases of about fifty per cent in daily word counts and thirty per cent in conversational turns. The improvement is not as marked for families that began the program with above-average word counts.”","1201","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Of course, the hard numbers are only part of what you’d want to know: to assess how successful an intervention like Providence Talks had been, you’d have to look at whether the kids in the program entered kindergarten readier to learn, with bigger vocabularies than those of children in a control group. Wong and his team are looking at these questions.","1202","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"The caseworkers at Providence Talks had impressed me with their sunny, gentle directives, but I wasn’t sure if they could effect sweeping changes in the children’s lives. Many of the core aspects of a parent’s conversational style would be hard to alter, from grammar to vocabulary. And it didn’t seem easy to revise, say, a parent’s relationship to books. Riquetti had told me about a mother in the program who came to her crying because she had never read a book to her toddler. Since the child couldn’t read, she hadn’t seen the point of turning the pages together, looking at the pictures. Now she would try it, but she wouldn’t be drawing on what the linguistic anthropologist Shirley Brice Heath had described to me as the “romantic memory, the nostalgia, of books being read to you when you were a child.” Even if you succeeded in getting such parents to read books regularly, the effect of the intervention would be minimal compared with, say, helping somebody like Maranda Raposo go back and finish her education. The last time I spoke with Raposo, she told me that, with two jobs and her kids to care for, she didn’t have time to study for her G.E.D. When I tried, on several occasions, to contact the family again, I couldn’t reach them—their phones didn’t seem to be working—and Stephanie Taveras thought that they might have moved.","1203","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Providence Talks had more obvious value if you saw it as the beginning of a series of sustained interventions. Some of the children will likely attend preschool programs that will help them build on any language gains. Providence Talks will also help identify kids who could benefit from speech therapy and other support. Mayor Taveras told me he hopes that this integrated approach will become a model for the rest of the country.","1204","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"The word “empowering” is overused, but a clear strength of Providence Talks is that it seemed to instill confidence in parents. Those rising graphs promised that parents could make a demonstrable difference in their children’s lives. The parents I met did not seem to feel chided by the data, and they liked the idea of competing with their partners or themselves to log higher word counts.","1205","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"One night in Providence, I had dinner with Andrea Riquetti and Toby Shepherd, the official who had first told Mayor Taveras about the word-gap problem. “Providence Talks is not a panacea,” Shepherd said. “These families face all kinds of challenges—unemployment or whatever it is. My hope is that it’s a helpful tool.”","1206","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"Riquetti said, “It’s a chance to talk with parents about how they can positively interact with their kids. Sometimes in their busy lives, their stressful lives, they miss out on that.” The goal, she said, was to help parents “feel they can make a difference when everything else kind of sucks.” ♦","1207","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/talking-cure"
"In anticipation of New Year’s Eve, 2014, Xi Jinping, the President of China and the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, permitted a camera crew to come into his office and record a message to the people. As a teen-ager, Xi had been sent to work on a farm; he was so delicate that other laborers rated him a six on a ten-point scale, “not even as high as the women,” he said later, with some embarrassment. Now, at sixty-one, Xi was five feet eleven, taller than any Chinese leader in nearly four decades, with a rich baritone and a confident heft. When he received a guest, he stood still, long arms slack, hair pomaded, a portrait of take-it-or-leave-it composure that induced his visitor to cross the room in pursuit of a handshake.","1208","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, read his annual New Year’s greeting from a lectern in an antiseptic reception hall. Xi, who took office in November, 2012, has associated himself with an earthier generation of Communists, a military caste that emphasized “hard work and plain living.” He delivered his New Year’s message at his desk. Behind him, bookshelves held photographs that depicted him as Commander-in-Chief and family man. In one picture, he was wearing Army fatigues and a fur hat, visiting soldiers in a snowfield; in another, he was strolling with his wife and daughter, and escorting his father, Xi Zhongxun, a hallowed revolutionary, in a wheelchair. The shelves also held matching sets of books. Xi’s classroom education was interrupted for nearly a decade by the Cultural Revolution, and he has the autodidact’s habit of announcing his literary credentials. He often quotes from Chinese classics, and in an interview with the Russian press last year he volunteered that he had read Krylov, Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoyevsky, Nekrasov, Chernyshevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Sholokhov. When he visited France, he mentioned that he had read Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Saint-Simon, Fourier, Sartre, and twelve others. In his New Year’s remarks, Xi oscillated between socialist slogans (“Wave high the sword against corruption”) and catchphrases from Chinese social media (“I would like to click the thumbs-up button for our great people”). He vowed to fight poverty, improve the rule of law, and hold fast to history. When he listed the achievements of the past year, he praised the creation of a holiday dedicated to the Second World War: “Victory Day of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.”","1209","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi is the sixth man to rule the People’s Republic of China, and the first who was born after the revolution, in 1949. He sits atop a pyramid of eighty-seven million members of the Communist Party, an organization larger than the population of Germany. The Party no longer reaches into every corner of Chinese life, as it did in the nineteen-seventies, but Xi nevertheless presides over an economy that, by one measure, recently surpassed the American economy in size; he holds ultimate authority over every general, judge, editor, and state-company C.E.O. As Lenin ordained, in 1902, “For the center . . . to actually direct the orchestra, it needs to know who plays violin and where, who plays a false note and why.”","1210","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi’s New Year’s message was broadcast on state television and radio channels at 6:30 p.m., just before the evening news. A few hours later, the news veered sharply out of his control. In Shanghai, a large holiday crowd had gathered to celebrate on the Bund, the promenade beside the Huangpu River, with splendid views of the skyline. The crowd was growing faster than the space could handle. Around 11:30 p.m., the police sent hundreds of extra officers to keep order, but it was too late; a stairway was jammed, and people shouted and pushed. A stampede ensued. In all, thirty-six people suffocated or were trampled to death.","1211","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The disaster occurred in one of China’s most modern and prosperous places, and the public was appalled. In the days that followed, the Shanghai government held a memorial for the victims, and encouraged people to move on; Internet censors struck down discussion of who was responsible; police interrogated Web users who posted criticisms of the state. When relatives of the victims visited the site of the stampede, police watched them closely, and then erected metal barriers to render it unreachable. Caixin, an investigative media organization, revealed that, during the stampede, local officials in charge of the neighborhood were enjoying a banquet of sushi and sake, at the government’s expense, in a private room at the Empty Cicada, a luxury restaurant nearby. This was awkward news, because one of the President’s first diktats had been “Eight Rules” for public servants, to eliminate extravagance and corruption. Among other things, the campaign called on officials to confine themselves to “four dishes and one soup.” (Eventually, eleven officials were punished for misusing funds and for failing to prevent a risk to the public.)","1212","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"A few weeks after the incident in Shanghai, I paid a call on a longtime editor in Beijing, whose job gives him a view into the workings of the Party. When I arrived at his apartment, his kids were in raucous control of the living room, so we retreated to his bedroom to talk. When I asked him how President Xi was doing, he mentioned the banquet at the Empty Cicada. He thought it pointed to a problem that is much deeper than a few high-living bureaucrats. “The central government issued an order absolutely forbidding them to dine out on public funds. And they did it anyway!” he said. “What this tells you is that local officials are finding their ways of responding to change. There is a saying: ‘When a rule is imposed up high, there is a way to get around it below.’ ” The struggle between an emperor and his bureaucracy follows a classic pattern in Chinese politics, and it rarely ends well for the emperor. But the editor was betting on Xi. “He’s not afraid of Heaven or Earth. And he is, as we say, round on the outside and square on the inside; he looks flexible, but inside he is very hard.”","1213","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Before Xi took power, he was described, in China and abroad, as an unremarkable provincial administrator, a fan of American pop culture (“The Godfather,” “Saving Private Ryan”) who cared more about business than about politics, and was selected mainly because he had alienated fewer peers than his competitors. It was an incomplete portrait. He had spent more than three decades in public life, but Chinese politics had exposed him to limited scrutiny. At a press conference, a local reporter once asked Xi to rate his performance: “Would you give yourself a score of a hundred—or a score of ninety?” (Neither, Xi said; a high number would look “boastful,” and a low number would reflect “low self-esteem.”)","1214","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"But, a quarter of the way through his ten-year term, he has emerged as the most authoritarian leader since Chairman Mao. In the name of protection and purity, he has investigated tens of thousands of his countrymen, on charges ranging from corruption to leaking state secrets and inciting the overthrow of the state. He has acquired or created ten titles for himself, including not only head of state and head of the military but also leader of the Party’s most powerful committees—on foreign policy, Taiwan, and the economy. He has installed himself as the head of new bodies overseeing the Internet, government restructuring, national security, and military reform, and he has effectively taken over the courts, the police, and the secret police. “He’s at the center of everything,” Gary Locke, the former American Ambassador to Beijing, told me.","1215","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"In the Chinese Communist Party, you campaign after you get the job, not before, and in building public support and honing a message Xi has revealed a powerful desire for transformation. He calls on China to pursue the Chinese Dream: the “great rejuvenation of the nation,” a mixture of prosperity, unity, and strength. He has proposed at least sixty social and economic changes, ranging from relaxing the one-child policy to eliminating camps for “reëducation through labor” and curtailing state monopolies. He has sought prestige abroad; on his first foreign trip (to Moscow), he was accompanied by his wife, a celebrity soprano named Peng Liyuan, who inspired lavish coverage of China’s first modern Presidential couple. Peng soon appeared on Vanity Fair’s Best-Dressed List.","1216","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"After Mao, China encouraged the image of a “collective Presidency” over the importance of individual leaders. Xi has revised that approach, and his government, using old and new tools, has enlarged his image. In the spirit of Mao’s Little Red Book, publishers have produced eight volumes of Xi’s speeches and writings; the most recent, titled “The Remarks of Xi Jinping,” dissects his utterances, ranks his favorite phrases, and explains his cultural references. A study of the People’s Daily found that, by his second anniversary in office, Xi was appearing in the paper more than twice as often as his predecessor at the same point. He stars in a series of cartoons aimed at young people, beginning with “How to Make a Leader,” which describes him, despite his family pedigree, as a symbol of meritocracy—“one of the secrets of the China miracle.” The state news agency has taken the unprecedented step of adopting a nickname for the General Secretary: Xi Dada—roughly, Big Uncle Xi. In January, the Ministry of Defense released oil paintings depicting him in heroic poses; thousands of art students applying to the Beijing University of Technology had been judged on their ability to sketch his likeness. The Beijing Evening News reported that one applicant admired the President so much that “she had to work hard to stop her hands from trembling.”","1217","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"To outsiders, Xi has been a fitful subject. Bookstores in Hong Kong, which are insulated from mainland control, offer portraits of varying quality—the most reliable include “The New Biography of Xi Jinping,” by Liang Jian, and “China’s Future,” by Wu Ming—but most are written at a remove, under pseudonyms. The clearest account of Xi’s life and influences comes from his own words and decisions, scattered throughout a long climb to power.","1218","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister of Australia, a Mandarin speaker who has talked with Xi at length over the years, told me, “What he says is what he thinks. My experience of him is that there’s not a lot of artifice.”","1219","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"In a leadership known for grooming colorless apparatchiks, Xi projects an image of manly vigor. He mocks “eggheads” and praises the “team spirit of a group of dogs eating a lion.” In a meeting in March, 2013, he told the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, “We are similar in character,” though Xi is less inclined toward bare-chested machismo. Xi admires Song Jiang, a fictional outlaw from “Water Margin,” a fourteenth-century Chinese classic, for his ability to “unite capable people.” Neither brilliant nor handsome, Song Jiang led a band of heroic rebels. In a famous passage, he speaks of the Xunyang River: “I shall have my revenge some day / And dye red with blood the Xunyang’s flow.”","1220","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi describes his essential project as a rescue: he must save the People’s Republic and the Communist Party before they are swamped by corruption; environmental pollution; unrest in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and other regions; and the pressures imposed by an economy that is growing more slowly than at any time since 1990 (though still at about seven per cent, the fastest pace of any major country). “The tasks our Party faces in reform, development, and stability are more onerous than ever, and the conflicts, dangers, and challenges are more numerous than ever,” Xi told the Politburo, in October. In 2014, the government arrested nearly a thousand members of civil society, more than in any year since the mid-nineteen-nineties, following the Tiananmen Square massacre, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a Hong Kong-based advocacy group.","1221","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi unambiguously opposes American democratic notions. In 2011 and 2012, he spent several days with Vice-President Joe Biden, his official counterpart at the time, in China and the United States. Biden told me that Xi asked him why the U.S. put “so much emphasis on human rights.” Biden replied to Xi, “No President of the United States could represent the United States were he not committed to human rights,” and went on, “If you don’t understand this, you can’t deal with us. President Barack Obama would not be able to stay in power if he did not speak of it. So look at it as a political imperative. It doesn’t make us better or worse. It’s who we are. You make your decisions. We’ll make ours.”","1222","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"In Xi’s early months, supporters in the West speculated that he wanted to silence hard-line critics, and would open up later, perhaps in his second term, which begins in 2017. That view has largely disappeared. Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary, whose upcoming book, “Dealing with China,” describes a decade of contact with Xi, told me, “He has been very forthright and candid—privately and publicly—about the fact that the Chinese are rejecting Western values and multiparty democracy.” He added, “To Westerners, it seems very incongruous to be, on the one hand, so committed to fostering more competition and market-driven flexibility in the economy and, on the other hand, to be seeking more control in the political sphere, the media, and the Internet. But that’s the key: he sees a strong Party as essential to stability, and the only institution that’s strong enough to help him accomplish his other goals.”","1223","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"In his determination to gain control and protect the Party, Xi may have generated a different kind of threat: he has pried apart internal fault lines and shaken the equilibrium that for a generation marked the nation’s rise. Before Xi took power, top officials presumed that they were protected. Yu Hua, the novelist, told me, “As China grew, what really came to matter were the ‘unwritten rules.’ When the real rules weren’t specific enough or clear enough, when policies and laws lagged behind reality, you always relied on the unwritten rules.” They dictated everything from how much to tip a surgeon to how far an N.G.O. could go before it was suppressed. “The unwritten rules have been broken,” Yu said. “This is how it should be, of course, but laws haven’t arrived yet.”","1224","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The Communist Party dedicated itself to a classless society but organized itself in a rigid hierarchy, and Xi started life near the top. He was born in Beijing in 1953, the third of four children. His father, Xi Zhongxun, China’s propaganda minister at the time, had been fomenting revolution since the age of fourteen, when he and his classmates tried to poison a teacher whom they considered a counterrevolutionary. He was sent to jail, where he joined the Communist Party, and eventually he became a high-ranking commander, which plunged him into the Party’s internal feuds. In 1935, a rival faction accused Xi of disloyalty and ordered him to be buried alive, but Mao defused the crisis. At a Party meeting in February, 1952, Mao stated that the “suppression of counterrevolutionaries” required, on average, the execution of one person for every one thousand to two thousand citizens. Xi Zhongxun endorsed “severe suppression and punishment,” but in his area “killing was relatively lower,” according to his official biography.","1225","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi Jinping grew up with his father’s stories. “He talked about how he joined the revolution, and he’d say, ‘You will certainly make revolution in the future,’ ” Xi recalled in a 2004 interview with the Xi’an Evening News, a state-run paper. “He’d explain what revolution is. We heard so much of this that our ears got calluses.” In six decades of politics, his father had seen or deployed every tactic. At dinner with the elder Xi in 1980, David Lampton, a China specialist at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins, marvelled that he could toast dozens of guests, over glasses of Maotai, with no visible effects. “It became apparent that he was drinking water,” Lampton said.","1226","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"When Xi Jinping was five, his father was promoted to Vice-Premier, and the son often visited him at Zhongnanhai, the secluded compound for top leaders. Xi was admitted to the exclusive August 1st School, named for the date of a famous Communist victory. The school, which occupied the former palace of a Qing Dynasty prince, was nicknamed the lingxiu yaolan—the “cradle of leaders.” The students formed a small, close-knit élite; they lived in the same compounds, summered at the same retreats, and shared a sense of noblesse oblige. For centuries before the People’s Republic, an evolving list of élite clans combined wealth and politics. Some sons handled business; others pursued high office. Winners changed over time, and, when Communist leaders prevailed, in 1949, they acquired the mantle. “The common language used to describe this was that they had ‘won over tianxia’—‘all under Heaven,’ ” Yang Guobin, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. “They believed they had a natural claim to leadership. They owned it. And their children thought, naturally, they themselves would be, and should be, the future owners.” As the historian Mi Hedu observes in his 1993 book, “The Red Guard Generation,” students at the August 1st School “compared one another on the basis of whose father had a higher rank, whose father rode in a better car. Some would say, ‘Obey whoever’s father has the highest position.’ ” When the Cultural Revolution began, in 1966, Beijing students who were zilaihong (“born red”) promoted a slogan: “If the father is a hero, the son is also a hero; if the father is a reactionary, the son is a bastard.” Red Guards sought to cleanse the capital of opposition, to make it “as pure and clean as crystal,” they said. From late August to late September, 1966, nearly two thousand people were killed in Beijing, and at least forty-nine hundred historical sites were damaged or destroyed, according to Yiching Wu, the author of “The Cultural Revolution at the Margins.”","1227","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"But Xi Jinping did not fit cleanly into the role of either aggressor or victim. In 1962, his father was accused of supporting a novel that Mao opposed, and was sent to work in a factory; his mother, Qi Xin, was assigned to hard labor on a farm. In January, 1967, after Mao encouraged students to target “class enemies,” a group of young people dragged Xi Zhongxun before a crowd. Among other charges, he was accused of having gazed at West Berlin through binoculars during a visit to East Germany years earlier. He was detained in a military garrison, where he passed the years by walking in circles, he said later—ten thousand laps, and then ten thousand walking backward. The son was too young to be an official Red Guard, and his father’s status made him undesirable. Moreover, being born red was becoming a liability. Élite academies were accused of being xiao baota—“little treasure pagodas”—and shut down. Xi and the sons of other targeted officials stayed together, getting into street fights and swiping books from shuttered libraries. Later, Xi described that period as a dystopian collapse of control. He was detained “three or four times” by groups of Red Guards, and forced to denounce his father. In 2000, he told the journalist Yang Xiaohuai about being captured by a group loyal to the wife of the head of China’s secret police:","1228","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"In December, 1968, in a bid to regain control, Mao ordered the Red Guards and other students to the countryside, to be “reëducated by the poor and lower-middle-class peasants.” Élite families sent their children to regions that had allies or family, and Xi went to his father’s old stronghold in Shaanxi. He was assigned to Liangjiahe, a village flanked by yellow cliffs. “The intensity of the labor shocked me,” Xi recalled in a 2004 television interview. To avoid work, he took up smoking—nobody bothered a man smoking—and lingered in the bathroom. After three months, he fled to Beijing, but he was arrested and returned to the village. In what later became the centerpiece of his official narrative, Xi was reborn. A recent state-news-service article offers the mythology: “Xi lived in a cave dwelling with villagers, slept on a kang, a traditional Chinese bed made of bricks and clay, endured flea bites, carried manure, built dams and repaired roads.” It leaves out some brutal details. At one point, he received a letter informing him that his older half-sister Xi Heping had died. The Australian journalist John Garnaut, the author of an upcoming book on the rise of Xi and his cohort, said, “It was suicide. Close associates have said to me, on the record, that after a decade of persecution she hanged herself from a shower rail.”","1229","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi chose to join the Communist Party’s Youth League. Because of his father’s status, his application was rejected seven times, by his count. After Xi befriended a local official, he was accepted. In January, 1974, he gained full Party membership and became secretary of the village. His drive to join the Party baffled some of his peers. A longtime friend who became a professor later told an American diplomat that he felt “betrayed” by Xi’s ambition to “join the system.” According to a U.S. diplomatic cable recounting his views, many in Xi’s élite cohort were desperate to escape politics; they dated, drank, and read Western literature. They were “trying to catch up for lost years by having fun,” the professor said. He eventually concluded that Xi was “exceptionally ambitious,” and knew that he would “not be special” outside China, so he “chose to survive by becoming redder than the red.” After all, Yang Guobin told me, referring to the sons of the former leaders, “the sense of ownership did not die. A sense of pride and superiority persisted, and there was some confidence that their fathers’ adversity would be temporary and sooner or later they would make a comeback. That’s exactly what happened.”","1230","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The following year, Xi enrolled at Tsinghua University as a “worker-peasant-soldier” student (applicants who were admitted on the basis of political merit rather than test scores). That spring, Xi Zhongxun was rehabilitated, after sixteen years of persecution. When the family reunited, he could not recognize his grown sons. His faith never wavered. In November, 1976, he wrote to Hua Guofeng, the head of the Party, asking for reassignment, in order to “devote the rest of my life to the Party and strive to do more for the people.” He signed it, “Xi Zhongxun, a Follower of Chairman Mao and a Party Member Who Has Not Regained Admission to Regular Party Activities.”","1231","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi Jinping’s pedigree had exposed him to a brutal politics—purges, retribution, rehabilitation—and he drew blunt lessons from it. In a 2000 interview with the journalist Chen Peng, of the Beijing-based Chinese Times, Xi said, “People who have little experience with power, those who have been far away from it, tend to regard these things as mysterious and novel. But I look past the superficial things: the power and the flowers and the glory and the applause. I see the detention houses, the fickleness of human relationships. I understand politics on a deeper level.” The Cultural Revolution and his years in Yan’an, the region where he was sent as a teen-ager, had created him. “Yan’an is the starting point of my life,” he said in 2007. “Many of the fundamental ideas and qualities I have today were formed in Yan’an.” Rudd, the former Australian Prime Minister, told me, “The bottom line in any understanding of who Xi Jinping is must begin with his dedication to the Party as an institution—despite the fact that through his personal life, and his political life, he has experienced the best of the Party and the worst of the Party.”","1232","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi’s siblings scattered: his brother and a sister went into business in Hong Kong, the other sister reportedly settled in Canada. But Xi stayed and, year by year, invested more deeply in the Party. After graduating, in 1979, he took a coveted job as an aide to Geng Biao, a senior defense official whom Xi’s father called “my closest comrade-in-arms” from the revolution. Xi wore a military uniform and made valuable connections at Party headquarters. Not long after college, he married Ke Xiaoming, the cosmopolitan daughter of China’s Ambassador to Britain. But they fought “almost every day,” according to the professor, who lived across the hall. He told the diplomat that the couple divorced when Ke decided to move to England and Xi stayed behind.","1233","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"China’s revolutionaries were aging, and the Party needed to groom new leaders. Xi told the professor that going to the provinces was the “only path to central power.” Staying at Party headquarters in Beijing would narrow his network and invite resentment from lesser-born peers. In 1982, shortly before Xi turned thirty, he asked to be sent back to the countryside, and was assigned to a horse-cart county in Hebei Province. He wanted to be the county secretary—the boss—but the provincial chief resented privileged offspring from Party headquarters and made Xi the No. 2. It was the Chinese equivalent of trading an executive suite at the Pentagon for a mid-level post in rural Virginia.","1234","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Within a year, though, Xi was promoted, and he honed his political skills. He gave perks to retired cadres who could shape his reputation; he arranged for them to receive priority at doctors’ offices; when he bought the county’s first imported car, he donated it to the “veteran-cadre office,” and used an old jeep for himself. He retained his green Army-issue trousers to convey humility, and he learned the value of political theatrics: at times, “if you don’t bang on the table, it’s not frightening enough, and people won’t take it seriously,” he told a Chinese interviewer in 2003. He experimented with market economics, by allowing farmers to use more land for raising animals instead of growing grain for the state, and he pushed splashy local projects, including the construction of a television studio based on the classic novel “A Dream of Red Mansions.”","1235","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"In 1985, he spent two weeks in Iowa as part of an agricultural delegation. In the town of Muscatine, he stayed with Eleanor and Thomas Dvorchak. “The boys had gone off to college, so there were some spare bedrooms,” Eleanor told me. Xi slept in a room with football-themed wallpaper and “Star Trek” action figures. “He was looking out the window, and it seemed like he was saying, ‘Oh, my God,’ and I thought, What’s so unusual? It’s just a split-level,” she said. Xi did not introduce himself as a Communist Party secretary; his business card identified him as the head of the Shijiazhuang Feed Association. In 2012, on a trip to the U.S. before becoming top leader, he returned to Muscatine, to see Dvorchak and others, trailed by the world press. She said, “No one in their right mind would ever think that that guy who stayed in my house would become the President. I don’t care what country you’re talking about.”","1236","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"By 1985, Xi was ready for another promotion, but the provincial Party head blocked him again, so he moved to the southern province of Fujian, where one of his father’s friends was the Party secretary, and could help him. Not long after he arrived, he met Liao Wanlong, a Taiwanese businessman, who recalled, “He was tall and stocky, and he looked a little dopey.” Liao, who has visited Xi repeatedly in the decades since, told me, “He appeared to be guileless, honest. He came from the north and he didn’t understand the south well.” Liao went on, “He would speak only if he really had something to say, and he didn’t make casual promises. He would think everything through before opening his mouth. He rarely talked about his family, because he had a difficult past and a disappointing marriage.” Xi didn’t have a questing mind, but he excelled at managing his image and his relationships; he was now meeting foreign investors, so he stopped wearing Army fatigues and adopted a wardrobe of Western suits. Liao said, “Not everyone could get an audience with him; he would screen those who wanted to meet him. He was a good judge of people.”","1237","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The following year, when Xi was thirty-three, a friend introduced him to Peng Liyuan, who, at twenty-four, was already one of China’s most famous opera and folk singers. Xi told her that he didn’t watch television, she recalled in a 2007 interview. “What kind of songs do you sing?” he asked. Peng thought that he looked “uncultured and much older than his age,” but he asked her questions about singing technique, which she took as a sign of intelligence. Xi later said that he decided within forty minutes to ask her to marry him. They married the following year, and in 1989, after the crackdown on student demonstrators, Peng was among the military singers who were sent to Tiananmen Square to serenade the troops. (Images of that scene, along with information about Peng’s private life and her commercial dealings, have been largely expunged from the Web.) In 1992, they had a daughter. As it became clear that Xi would be a top leader, Peng gave up the diva gowns and elaborate hairdos in favor of pants suits and the occasional military uniform. Fans still mobbed her, while he stood patiently to the side, but for the most part she stopped performing and turned her attention to activism around H.I.V., tobacco control, and women’s education. For years, Xi and Peng spent most of their time apart. But, in the flurry of attention around Big Uncle Xi, the state-run media has promoted a pop song entitled “Xi Dada Loves Peng Mama,” which includes the line “Men should learn from Xi and women should learn from Peng.”","1238","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The posting to the south put Xi closer to his father. Since 1978, his father had served in neighboring Guangdong, home to China’s experiments with the free market, and the elder Xi had become a zealous believer in economic reform as the answer to poverty. It was a risky position: at a Politburo meeting in 1987, the Old Guard attacked the liberal standard-bearer, Hu Yaobang. Xi’s father was the only senior official who spoke in his defense. “What are you guys doing here? Don’t repeat what Mao did to us,” he said, according to Richard Baum’s 1994 chronicle of élite politics, “Burying Mao.” But Xi lost and was stripped of power for the last time. He was allowed to live in comfortable obscurity until his death, in 2002, and is remembered fondly as “a man of principle, not of strategy,” as the editor in Beijing put it to me.","1239","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"His son avoided overly controversial reforms as he rose through the ranks. “My approach is to heat a pot with a small, continuous fire, pouring in cold water to keep it from boiling over,” he said. In 1989, a local propaganda official, Kang Yanping, submitted a proposal for a TV miniseries promoting political reform, but Xi replied with skepticism. According to “China’s Future,” he asked, “Is there a source for the opinion? Is it a reasonable point?” The show, which Xi predicted would leave people “discouraged,” was not produced. He also paid special attention to cultivating local military units; he upgraded equipment, raised subsidies for soldiers’ living expenses, and found jobs for retiring officers. He liked to say, “To meet the Army’s needs, nothing is excessive.”","1240","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi prosecuted corruption at some moments and ignored it at others. A Chinese executive told the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that Xi was considered “Mr. Clean” for turning down a bribe, and yet, for the many years that Xi worked in Fujian, the Yuanhua Group, one of China’s largest corrupt enterprises, continued smuggling billions of dollars’ worth of oil, cars, cigarettes, and appliances into China, with the help of the Fujian military and police. Xi also found a way to live with Chen Kai, a local tycoon who ran casinos and brothels in the center of town, protected by the police chief. Later, Chen was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death, and fifty government officials were prosecuted for accepting bribes from him. Xi was never linked to the cases, but they left a stain on his tenure. “Sometimes I have posted colleagues wrongly,” he said in 2000. “Some were posted wrongly because I thought they were better than they actually were, others because I thought they were worse than they actually were.”","1241","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi proved adept at navigating internal feuds and alliances. After he took over the economically vibrant province of Zhejiang, in 2002, he created policies intended to promote private businesses. He encouraged taxi services to buy from Geely, the car company that later bought Volvo. He soothed conservatives, in part by reciting socialist incantations. “The private economy has become an exotic flower in the garden of socialism with Chinese characteristics,” he declared. In 2007, he encountered a prime opportunity to show his political skills: a corruption scandal in Shanghai was implicating associates of Jiang Zemin, the powerful former President, who served from 1989 to 2002. Xi was sent to Shanghai to take over. He projected toughness to the public without alienating Jiang. He rejected the villa that had been arranged for him, announcing that it would be better used as a retirement home for veteran comrades.","1242","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"His timing was fortunate: a few months later, senior Party officials were choosing the next generation of top leaders. Xi was expected to lose to Li Keqiang, a comrade who had no revolutionary family pedigree, and had postgraduate degrees in law and economics from Peking University. Since 2002, the highest ranks of Chinese politics had been dominated by men who elbowed their way in on the basis of academic or technocratic merit. President Hu’s father ran a tea shop, and the Premier, Wen Jiabao, was the son of a teacher, but Chen Yun, the late economic czar, had advised his peers that born reds, now known as “second-generation reds,” or princelings, would make more reliable stewards of the Party’s future. One princeling told a Western diplomat, “The feeling among us is: ‘Hu Jintao, Wen Jiabao, your fathers were selling shoelaces while our fathers were dying for this revolution.’ ” In private, some princelings referred to the President and the Premier as huoji—“hired hands.” In October, 2007, Xi was unveiled as the likely heir apparent. It was not entirely a compliment. “Party leaders prefer weak successors, so they can rule behind the scenes,” Ho Pin, the founder of Mingjing News, an overseas Chinese site, said. Xi’s rise had been so abrupt, in the eyes of the general public, that people joked, “Who is Xi Jinping? He’s Peng Liyuan’s husband.”","1243","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi was tested by a pageant of dysfunction that erupted in the run-up to his début as General Secretary, in 2012. In February, Wang Lijun, a former police chief, tried to defect to the U.S. and accused the family of his former patron, Bo Xilai, the Party secretary of Chongqing, of murder and embezzlement. Party leaders feared that Bo might protect himself with the security services at his command, disrupt the transition of power, and tear the Party apart. In September, Ling Jihua, the chief of staff of the outgoing President, was abruptly demoted, and he was later accused of trying to cover up the death of his son, who had crashed a black Ferrari while accompanied by two women.","1244","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Beset by crises, Xi suddenly disappeared. On September 4, 2012, he cancelled a meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and visits with other dignitaries. As the days passed, lurid rumors emerged, ranging from a grave illness to an assassination attempt. When he reappeared, on September 19th, he told American officials that he had injured his back. Analysts of Chinese politics still raise the subject of Xi’s disappearance in the belief that a fuller explanation of why he vanished might illuminate the depth, or fragility, of his support. In dozens of conversations this winter, scholars, officials, journalists, and executives told me that they suspect he did have a health problem, and also reasons to exploit it. They speculate that Xi, in effect, went on strike; he wanted to install key allies, and remove opponents, before taking power, but Party elders ordered him to wait. A former intelligence official told me, “Xi basically says, ‘O.K., fuck you, let’s see you find someone else for this job. I’m going to disappear for two weeks and miss the Secretary of State.’ And that’s what he did. It caused a stir, and they went running and said, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa.’ ” The handoff went ahead as planned. On November 15, 2012, Xi became General Secretary.","1245","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi headed a Politburo Standing Committee of seven men: four were considered princelings by birth or marriage, a larger ratio than in any Politburo in the history of the People’s Republic. Western politicians often note that Xi has the habits of a retail pol: comfort on the rope line, gentle questions for every visitor, homey anecdotes. On a trip to Los Angeles, he told students that he likes to swim, read, and watch sports on television, but rarely has time. “To borrow a title from an American film, it’s like ‘Mission: Impossible,’ ” he said. But Chinese observers tend to mention something else: his guizuqi, or “air of nobility.” It can come off as a reassuring link to the past or, at times, as a distance from his peers. In a meeting at the Great Hall of the People last year, Party officials were chatting and glad-handing during a lengthy break, but Xi never budged. “It went on for hours, and he sat there, staring straight ahead,” a foreign attendee told me. “He never wandered down from the podium to say, ‘How’s it going in Ningxia?’ ”","1246","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi believed that there was a grave threat to China from within. According to U.S. diplomats, Xi’s friend the professor described Xi as “repulsed by the all-encompassing commercialization of Chinese society, with its attendant nouveaux riches, official corruption, loss of values, dignity, and self-respect, and such ‘moral evils’ as drugs and prostitution.” If he ever became China’s top leader, the professor had predicted, “he would likely aggressively attempt to address these evils, perhaps at the expense of the new moneyed class.” Though princelings and their siblings had profited comfortably from China’s rise (Xi’s sister Qi Qiaoqiao is reported to have large corporate and real-estate assets), the revolutionary families considered their gains appropriate, and they blamed the hired hands for allowing corruption and extravagance, which stirred up public rage and threatened the Party’s future.","1247","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The first step to a solution was to reëstablish control. The “collective Presidency,” which spread power across the Standing Committee, had constrained Hu Jintao so thoroughly that he was nicknamed the Woman with Bound Feet. Xi surrounded himself with a shadow cabinet that was defined less by a single ideology than by school ties and political reliability. Members included Liu He, a childhood playmate who had become a reform-minded economist, and Liu Yuan, a hawkish general and the son of former President Liu Shaoqi. The most important was Wang Qishan, a friend for decades, who was placed in charge of the Central Commission on Discipline and Inspection, the agency that launched the vast anticorruption campaign.","1248","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The Party had long cultivated an image of virtuous unanimity. But, during the next two years, Wang’s investigators, who were granted broad powers to detain and interrogate, attacked agencies that might counter Xi’s authority, accusing them of conspiracies and abuses. They brought corruption charges against officials at the state-planning and state-assets commissions, which protect the privileges of large government-run monopolies. They arrested China’s security chief, Zhou Yongkang, a former oil baron with the jowls of an Easter Island statue, who had built the police and military into a personal kingdom that received more funding each year for domestic spying and policing than it did for foreign defense. They reached into the ranks of the military, where flamboyant corruption was not only upsetting the public—pedestrians had learned to watch out for luxury sedans with military license plates, which careered around Beijing with impunity—but also undermining China’s national defense. When police searched homes belonging to the family of Lieutenant General Gu Junshan, a senior logistics chief, they removed four truckloads of wine, art, cash, and other luxuries. According to a diplomat in Beijing, Gu’s furnishings included a gold replica of China’s first aircraft carrier. “When questioned about it, he said it was a sign of patriotism,” the diplomat said.","1249","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"By the end of 2014, the Party had announced the punishment of more than a hundred thousand officials on corruption charges. Many foreign observers asked if Xi’s crusade was truly intended to stamp out corruption or if it was a tool to attack his enemies. It was not simply one or the other: corruption had become so threatening to the Party’s legitimacy that only the most isolated leader could have avoided forcing it back to a more manageable level, but railing against corruption was also a proven instrument for political consolidation, and at the highest levels Xi has deployed it largely against his opponents. Geremie Barme, the historian who heads the Australian Centre on China in the World, analyzed the forty-eight most high-profile arrests, and discovered that none of them were second-generation reds. “I don’t call it an anticorruption campaign,” a Western diplomat told me. “This is grinding trench warfare.”","1250","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Shortly after taking over, Xi asked, “Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse?” and declared, “It’s a profound lesson for us.” Chinese scholars had studied that puzzle from dozens of angles, but Xi wanted more. “In 2009, he commissioned a long study of the Soviet Union from somebody who works in the policy-research office,” the diplomat in Beijing told me. “It concluded that the rot started under Brezhnev. In the paper, the guy cited a joke: Brezhnev brings his mother to Moscow. He proudly shows her the state apartments at the Kremlin, his Zil limousine, and the life of luxury he now lives. ‘Well, what do you think, Mama,’ says Brezhnev. ‘You’ll never have to worry about a thing, ever again.’ ‘I’m so proud of you, Leonid Ilyich,’ says Mama, ‘but what happens if the Communists find out?’ Xi loved the story.” Xi reserved special scorn for Gorbachev, for failing to defend the Party against its opponents, and told his colleagues, “Nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.”","1251","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The year after Xi took office, cadres were required to watch a six-part documentary on the Soviet Union’s collapse, which showed violent scenes of unrest and described an American conspiracy to topple Communism through “peaceful evolution”: the steady infiltration of subversive Western political ideas. Ever since the early aughts, when “color revolutions” erupted in the former Soviet bloc, Chinese Communists have cited the risk of contagion as a reason to constrict political life. That fear was heightened by a surge of unrest in Tibet in 2008, in Xinjiang in 2009, and across the Arab world in 2011. Last September, when pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong, an opinion piece in the Global Times, a state-run daily, accused the National Endowment for Democracy and the C.I.A. of being “black hands” behind the unrest, intent on “stimulating Taiwanese independence, Xinjiang independence, and Tibetan independence.” (The U.S. denied involvement.)","1252","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi’s government has no place for loyal opposition. When he launched the anticorruption campaign, activists—such as the lawyer Xu Zhiyong, who had served as a local legislator in Beijing—joined in, calling on officials to disclose their incomes. But Xu and many others were arrested. (He was later sentenced to four years in prison for “gathering crowds to disrupt public order.”) One of Xu’s former colleagues, Teng Biao, told me, “For the government, ‘peaceful evolution’ was not just a slogan. It was real. The influence of Western states was becoming more obvious and more powerful.” Teng was at a conference in Germany soon after Xu and another colleague were arrested. “People advised me not to return to China, or I’d be arrested, too,” Teng said. He is now a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School.","1253","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"A prominent editor in Beijing told me that Chinese philanthropists have been warned, “You can’t give money to this N.G.O. or that N.G.O.—basically all N.G.O.s.” In December, the Committee to Protect Journalists counted forty-four reporters in Chinese jails, more than in any other country. Well-known human-rights lawyers—Pu Zhiqiang, Ding Jiaxi, Xia Lin—have been jailed. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch called this the harshest suppression of dissent in a decade.","1254","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Although Vladimir Putin has suffocated Russian civil society and neutered the press, Moscow stores still carry books that are critical of him, and a few long-suffering blogs still find ways to attack him. Xi is less tolerant. In February, 2014, Yiu Mantin, a seventy-nine-year-old editor at Hong Kong’s Morning Bell Press, who had planned to release a biography critical of Xi, by the exiled writer Yu Jie, was arrested during a visit to the mainland. He had received a phone call warning him not to proceed with publication. He was sentenced to ten years in prison, on charges of smuggling seven cans of paint.","1255","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"For years, Chinese intellectuals distinguished between words and actions: Western political ideas could be discussed in China as long as nobody tried to enact them. In 2011, China’s education minister, Yuan Guiren, extolled the benefits of exchanges with foreign countries. “Whether they’re rich or poor, socialist or capitalist, as long as they’re beneficial to our development we can learn from all of them,” he told the Jinghua Times, a state newspaper. But in January Yuan told a conference, “Young teachers and students are key targets of infiltration by enemy forces.” He said, “We must, by no means, allow into our classrooms material that propagates Western values.” An article on the Web site of Seeking Truth, an official Party journal, warned against professors who “blacken China’s name,” and it singled out the law professor He Weifang by name. When I spoke to He, a few days later, he said, “I’ve always been unpopular with conservatives, but recently the situation has become more serious. The political standpoint of this new slate of leaders isn’t like that of the Hu or Jiang era. They’re more restraining. They’re not as willing to permit an active discussion.”","1256","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Sealing China off from Western ideas poses some practical problems. The Party has announced “rule of law” reforms intended to strengthen top-down control over the legal system and shield courts from local interference. The professor said, “Many colleagues working on civil law and that sort of thing have a large portion of their lectures about German law or French law. So, if you want to stop Western values from spreading in Chinese universities, one thing you’d have to do is close down the law schools and make sure they never exist again.” Xi, for his part, sees no contradiction, because preservation of the Party comes before preservation of the law. In January, he said that China must “nurture a legal corps loyal to the Party, loyal to the country, loyal to the people, and loyal to the law.” Echoing Mao, he added, “Insure that the handle of the knife is firmly in the hand of the Party and the people.”","1257","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi’s wariness of Western influence is reflected in his foreign policy. On a personal level, he expresses warm memories of Iowa, and he sent his daughter, Xi Mingze, to Harvard. (She graduated last year, under a pseudonym, and has returned to China.) But Xi has also expressed an essentialist view of national characteristics such that, in his telling, China’s history and social makeup render it unfit for multiparty democracy or a monarchy or any other non-Communist system. “We considered them, tried them, but none worked,” he told an audience at the College of Europe, in Bruges, last spring. Adopting an alternative, he said, “might even lead to catastrophic consequences.” On his watch, state-run media have accentuated the threat of “peaceful evolution,” and have accused American companies, including Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel, of being “warriors” for the U.S. government.","1258","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"As for a broad diplomatic vision, Chinese leaders since Deng Xiaoping have adhered to a principle known as “Hide your strength, bide your time.” Xi has effectively replaced that concept with declarations of China’s arrival. In Paris last year, he invoked Napoleon’s remark that China was “a sleeping lion,” and said that the lion “has already awakened, but this is a peaceful, pleasant, and civilized lion.” He told the Politburo in December that he intends to “make China’s voice heard, and inject more Chinese elements into international rules.” As alternatives to the Washington-based World Bank and International Monetary Fund, Xi’s government has established the New Development Bank, the Silk Road infrastructure fund, and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which, together, intend to amass two hundred and forty billion dollars in capital. Xi has been far bolder than his predecessors in asserting Chinese control over airspace and land, sending an oil rig into contested waters, and erecting buildings, helipads, and other facilities on reefs that are claimed by multiple nations. He has also taken advantage of Putin’s growing economic isolation; Xi has met with Putin more than with any other foreign leader, and, last May, as Russia faced new sanctions over the annexation of Crimea, Xi and Putin agreed on a four-hundred-billion-dollar deal to supply gas to China at rates that favor Beijing. According to the prominent editor, Xi has told people that he was impressed by Putin’s seizure of Crimea—“He got a large piece of land and resources” and boosted his poll numbers at home. But, as war in Ukraine has dragged on, Xi has become less complimentary of Putin.","1259","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"No diplomatic relationship matters more to China’s future than its dealings with the United States, and Xi has urged the U.S. to adopt a “new type of great-power relationship”—to regard China as an equal and to acknowledge its claims to contested islands and other interests. (The Obama Administration has declined to adopt the phrase.) Xi and Obama have met, at length, five times. American officials describe the relationship as occasionally candid but not close. They have “brutally frank exchanges on difficult issues, and it doesn’t upset the apple cart,” a senior Administration official told me. “So it’s different from the era of Hu Jintao, where there was very little exchange.” Hu almost never departed from his notes, and American counterparts wondered how much he believed his talking points. “Xi is reading what I’m confident Xi believes,” the official said, though their engagements remain stilted: “There’s still a cadence that is very difficult to extract yourself from in these exchanges. . . . We want to have a conversation.”","1260","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"For years, American military leaders worried that there was a growing risk of an accidental clash between China and the U.S., in part because Beijing protested U.S. policies by declining meetings between senior commanders. In 2011, Mike Mullen, then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, visited Xi in Beijing, and appealed to his military experience, telling him, as he recalled to me, “I just need you to stop cutting off military relationships as step one, every time you get ticked off.” That has improved. In Beijing last November, Xi and Obama spent five hours at dinner and meetings and announced coöperation on climate change, a high-tech free-trade deal that China had previously resisted, and two military agreements to encourage communication between forces operating near each other in the South China and East China Seas. Mullen, who has met Xi again since their initial encounter, is encouraged: “They still get ticked off, they take steps, but they don’t cut it off.”","1261","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"As China ejects Western ideas, Xi is trying to fill that void with an affirmative set of ideas to offer at home and abroad. Recently, I rode the No. 1 subway line eastbound, beneath the Avenue of Eternal Peace—under Party headquarters, the Central Propaganda Department, and the Ministries of Commerce and Public Security—and got off the train at the Second Ring Road, where the old City Wall once stood. Near the station, at a Starbucks, I met Zhang Lifan, a well-known historian. At sixty-four, he defies the usual rumpled stereotype of the liberal intelligentsia; he is tall, with elegant hints of gray hair, and he wore a black mandarin-collar jacket and a winter cap covered in smooth black fur. Zhang grew up around politics; his father, a banker before the revolution, served as a minister in the early years of Mao’s government. I asked him what message Xi hoped to promote from China around the world. He said, “Ever since Mao’s day, and the beginning of reform and opening up, we all talk about a ‘crisis of faith,’ ” the sense that rapid growth and political turmoil have cut China off from its moral history. “He is trying to solve that problem, so that there can be another new ideology.”","1262","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Zhang writes about politics, and he is occasionally visited by police who remind him to avoid sensitive subjects. “Sometimes, they will pass by and say it through the closed front door,” Zhang said. He commented, “They tried to stop me from coming today. They followed me here.” He indicated a slim young man in a windbreaker, watching us from a nearby table. In remote areas, where police are unaccustomed to the presence of foreigners, authorities often try to prevent people from meeting reporters. But, in a decade of writing about China, this was the first time I’d encountered that situation in the capital. I suggested we postpone our discussion. He shook his head. In a stage whisper, he said, “What I say and what I write are the same. There’s no difference.”","1263","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The most surprising thing about the era of Xi Jinping is the decision to close off the margins—those minor mutinies and indulgences that used to be tolerated as a way to avoid driving China’s most prosperous and well-educated citizens abroad. For years, the government tacitly allowed people to gain access to virtual private networks, or V.P.N.s, which allow users to reach Web sites that are blocked in China. The risks seemed manageable; most Chinese users had less interest in politics than in reaching a celebrity’s Instagram feed (Instagram, like Facebook, Twitter, Bloomberg, Reuters, and the Times, is blocked). Keeping them open, the theory went, allowed sophisticated users to get what they wanted or needed—for instance, researchers accessing Google Scholar, or businesses doing transactions—while preventing the masses from employing technology that worries the Party. But on January 23rd, while I was in Beijing, the government abruptly blocked the V.P.N.s, and state media reiterated that they were illegal. Overnight, it became radically more difficult to reach anything on the Internet outside China. Before the comments were shut down on the Web site Computer News, twelve thousand people left their views. “What are you afraid of?” one asked. “Big step toward becoming a new North Korea,” another wrote. Another wrote: “One more advertisement for emigration.”","1264","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"A decade ago, the Chinese Internet was alive with debate, confession, humor, and discovery. Month by month, it is becoming more sterilized and self-contained. To the degree that China’s connection to the outside world matters, the digital links are deteriorating. Voice-over-Internet calls, viral videos, podcasts—the minor accessories of contemporary digital life—are less reachable abroad than they were a year ago. It’s an astonishing thing to observe in a rising superpower. How many countries in 2015 have an Internet connection to the world that is worse than it was a year ago?","1265","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The General Secretary, in his capacity as Big Uncle Xi, has taken to offering advice on nonpolitical matters: last fall, he lamented an overly “sensual” trend in society. (In response, Chinese auto executives stopped having lightly clad models lounge around vehicles at car shows.) In January, he urged people to get more sleep, “however enthusiastic you may be about the job,” saying that he goes to bed before midnight. Online, people joked that it seemed implausible: since taking office, Xi has acquired heavy bags under his eyes and a look of near-constant irritation.","1266","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"For a generation, the Communist Party forged a political consensus built on economic growth and legal ambiguity. Liberal activists and corrupt bureaucrats learned to skirt (or flout) legal boundaries, because the Party objected only intermittently. Today, Xi has indicated that consensus, beyond the Party élite, is superfluous—or, at least, less reliable than a hard boundary between enemies and friends.","1267","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"It is difficult to know precisely how much support Xi enjoys. Private pollsters are not allowed to explicitly measure his public support, but Victor Yuan, the president of Horizon Research Consultancy Group, a Beijing polling firm, told me, “We’ve done some indirect research, and his support seems to be around eighty per cent. It comes from two areas: one is the anticorruption policy and the other is foreign policy. The area where it’s unclear is the economy. People say they’ll have to wait and see.”","1268","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"China’s economy is likely to be Xi’s greatest obstacle. After economic growth of, on average, nearly ten per cent a year, for more than three decades, the Party expected growth to slow to a sustainable pace of around seven per cent, but it could fall more sharply. China remains the world’s largest manufacturer, with four trillion dollars in foreign-exchange reserves (a sum equivalent to the world’s fourth-largest economy). In November, 2013, the Party announced plans to reinvigorate competition by expanding the role of private banks, allowing the market (instead of bureaucrats) to decide where water, oil, and other precious resources are directed, and forcing state firms to give up larger dividends and compete with private businesses. Last spring, China abolished registered-capital and other requirements for new companies, and in November it allowed foreign investors to trade shares directly on the Shanghai stock market for the first time. “A fair judgment is that Xi’s government has achieved more progress, in more areas, in the past eighteen months than the Hu government did in its entire second term,” Arthur Kroeber, a longtime Beijing-based economist at Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm, told me. And yet, Kroeber added, “my confidence level is only slightly above fifty per cent” that the reforms will be enough to head off a recession.","1269","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The risks to China’s economy have rarely been more visible. The workforce is aging more quickly than in other countries (because of the one-child policy), and businesses are borrowing money more rapidly than they are earning it. David Kelly, a co-founder of China Policy, a Beijing-based research and advisory firm, said, “The turning point in the economy really was about four, five years ago, and now you see the classical problem of the declining productivity of capital. For every dollar you invest, you’re getting far less bang for your buck.” The growth of demand for energy and raw materials has slowed, more houses and malls are empty, and nervous Chinese savers are sending money overseas, to protect it in the event of a crisis. Some factories have not paid wages, and in the last quarter of 2014 workers held strikes, or other forms of protest, at three times the rate of the same period a year earlier.","1270","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Xi’s ability to avoid an economic crisis depends partly on whether he has the political strength to prevail over state firms, local governments, and other powerful interests. In his meetings with Rudd, the former Australian Prime Minister, Xi mentioned his father’s frustrated attempts to achieve market-oriented reforms. “Xi Jinping is legitimately proud of his father,” Rudd said, adding, “His father had a record of real achievement and was, frankly, a person who paid a huge political and personal price for being a dedicated Party man and a dedicated economic reformer.”","1271","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Historically, the Party has never perceived a contradiction between political crackdown and economic reform. In 2005, Premier Wen Jiabao met with a delegation from the U.S. Congress, and one member, citing a professor who had recently been fired for political reasons, asked the Premier why. Wen was baffled by the inquiry; the professor was a “small problem,” he said. “I don’t know the person you spoke of, but as Premier I have 1.3 billion people on my mind.”","1272","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"To maintain economic growth, China is straining to promote innovation, but by enforcing a political chill on Chinese campuses Xi risks suppressing precisely the disruptive thinking that the country needs for the future. At times, politics prevails over rational calculations. In 2014, after China had spent years investing in science and technology, the share of its economy devoted to research and development surpassed Europe’s. But, when the government announced the recipients of grants for social-science research, seven of the top ten projects were dedicated to analyzing Xi’s speeches (officially known as “General Secretary Xi’s Series of Important Speeches”) or his signature slogan: the Chinese Dream.","1273","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The era of Xi Jinping has defied the assumption that China’s fitful opening to the world is too critical and productive to stall. The Party today perceives an array of threats that, in the view of He Weifang, the law professor, will only increase in the years ahead. Before the Web, the professor said, “there really weren’t very many people who were able to access information from outside, so in Deng Xiaoping’s era the Party could afford to be a lot more open.” But now, if the Internet were unrestricted, “I believe it would bring in things that the leaders would consider very dangerous.”","1274","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Like many others I met this winter, He Weifang worries that the Party is narrowing the range of acceptable adaptation to the point that it risks uncontrollable change. I asked him what he thinks the Party will be like in ten or fifteen years. “I think, as intellectuals, we must do everything we can to promote a peaceful transformation of the Party—to encourage it to become a ‘leftist party’ in the European sense, a kind of social-democratic party.” That, he said, would help its members better respect a true system of law and political competition, including freedom of the press and freedom of thought. “If they refuse even these basic changes, then I believe China will undergo another revolution.”","1275","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"It is a dramatic prediction—and an oddly commonplace one these days. Zhang Lifan, the historian I saw at Starbucks, said, in full view of his minder, “In front of a lot of princeling friends, I’ve said that, if the Communist Party can’t take sufficient political reform in five or ten years, it could miss the chance entirely. As scholars, we always say it’s better to have reform than revolution, but in Chinese history this cycle repeats itself. Mao said we have to get rid of the cycle, but right now we’re still in it. This is very worrying.”","1276","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"Two months after the events of New Year’s Eve, the Party again confronted a collision between its instinct for control and the complexity of Chinese society. For years, the government had downplayed the severity of environmental pollution, describing it as an unavoidable cost of growth. But, year by year, the middle class was becoming less accommodating; in polls, urban citizens described pollution as their leading concern, and, using smartphones, they compared daily pollution levels to the standards set by the World Health Organization. After a surge of smog in 2013, the government intensified efforts to consolidate power plants, close small polluters, and tighten state control. Last year, it declared a “war against pollution,” but conceded that Beijing will not likely achieve healthy air before 2030. In a moment of candor, the mayor pronounced the city “unlivable.”","1277","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"In February, Chinese video sites posted a privately funded documentary, titled “Under the Dome,” in which Chai Jing, a former state-television reporter, described her growing alarm at the risks that air pollution poses to her infant daughter. It was a sophisticated production: Chai, in fashionable faded jeans and a white blouse, delivered a fast-paced, TED-style talk to a rapt studio audience, unspooling grim statistics and scenes in which bureaucrats admitted that powerful companies and agencies had rendered them incapable of protecting public health. In spirit, the film was consistent with the official “war on corruption,” and state-run media responded with a coördinated array of flattering coverage.","1278","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red"
"The film raced across social media, and by the end of the first week it had been viewed two hundred million times—a level usually reserved for pop-music videos rather than dense, two-hour documentaries.

"With stagnant wages and rising inequality already emerging as key issues in the 2016 Presidential race, there is, naturally, a lot of interest in how voters view the prospect of the federal government adopting more redistributive policies, such as raising taxes on the wealthy. Intuition and rational-choice theory would suggest that, as the gap between the wealthy and everybody else increases, support for redistribution goes up. But a number of empirical studies published in recent years have cast doubt on this theory, finding that support for redistribution has remained flat, or even that it has fallen.","April 17, 2015","1281","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"

Enns, of Cornell University, concluded, “When inequality in America rises, the public responds with increased conservative sentiment.” In a 2013 paper by Matthew Luttig, of the University of Minnesota, backed up this finding, noting, “the absolute level and the changing structure of inequality have largely been a force promoting conservatism, not increasing support for redistribution as theoretically expected.”","1282","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"

"In the Times on Wednesday, Thomas Edsall argued, “Redistribution is in trouble, and that is likely to tie America in knots for years to come.” The Economist’s Free Exchange column this week said that “politicians betting on their Robin Hood credentials” should be wary of voters, particularly older ones, because they “may be more inclined to back the Sheriff of Nottingham.” On Friday, the Times published another piece, by Neil Irwin, that was headlined “Why Americans Don’t Want to Soak the Rich.”","1284","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"On the face of it, these warnings seem justified. In addition to citing some recent academic studies, Edsall points to data from Gallup showing that, between 2006 and 2014, support for the proposition that the federal government should guarantee health-care coverage to all U.S. citizens has fallen from sixty-nine per cent to forty-five per cent. The Economist article cites a more recent study by three economists—Ilyana Kuziemko, of Princeton, and Vivekinan Ashok and Ebonya Washington, both of Yale—which says that declining support for redistributive policies is largely due to a shift in sentiment among the elderly. In the nineteen-seventies and eighties, people aged sixty-five and over were more favorably disposed to redistributive policies than the rest of the population. Today, they are less supportive than other age groups.","1285","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"If that were all there is to say, it would be worrying news indeed for those, myself included, who support using the tax code and other policies to offset some of the alarming rise in inequality. Fortunately, it’s not the entire story. Although the survey data mentioned above shouldn’t be dismissed, it needs to be placed in the context of other findings suggesting that Americans have a favorable attitude to redistribution, particularly when it is couched in terms of taking from the rich rather than giving to the poor.","1286","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"Last year, for example, Gallup asked a random sample of people for their views on “the way income and wealth are distributed in the U.S.” Almost seventy per cent of the respondents said that they were “very dissatisfied” or “somewhat dissatisfied” with the status quo. Fewer than one in three respondents said that they were “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied.”","1287","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"O.K., you might say, but that was just a snapshot, and the survey didn’t ask about redistributive policies. What does Gallup have to say about how attitudes toward redistribution have changed over time? Quite a lot, it turns out. For the past thirty years, the polling firm has been posing two questions that specifically concern this topic.","1288","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"The first question is “Do you feel that the distribution of money and wealth in this country is fair, or do you feel that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of people?” Since 1985, a majority of people have said that income and wealth should be more evenly distributed. The numbers have fluctuated quite a bit over the years. In the most recent survey, from 2013, fifty-nine per cent of respondents favored redistribution—a similar proportion to the first survey, thirty years ago, which found sixty per cent in favor. Yet the 2013 number represents a recent drop in support: in 2008, sixty-eight per cent of respondents said they favored redistribution. That might provide more support for Edsall’s suggestion that the Obama Administration’s policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act, have produced a backlash among some voters. Or it might confirm the theory, supported by a number of recent studies, that these days, in contrast to the nineteen-thirties, economic recessions tend to erode support for any form of government activism.","1289","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"The other Gallup question is more pointed: “Do you think our government should or should not redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich?” In 1985, forty-five per cent of respondents chose the option “Yes, should,” and fifty-one per cent chose “No, should not.” By 2008, the numbers had flipped, and a majority had emerged favoring heavy taxes the rich: fifty-one per cent of respondents chose “Yes, should,” and forty-three per cent chose “No, should not.” Did this more liberal attitude survive the Great Recession and its aftermath? Yes, it did. In 2013, the last time Gallup asked the question, fifty-two per cent of respondents chose the “Yes, should” option. “At this point, the American public would generally agree with Obama that wealth should ideally be more evenly distributed—and a modest majority, consisting mainly of Democrats and independents, appears to support the idea of bringing about that redistribution through heavier taxes on the rich,” Frank Newport, Gallup’s editor-in-chief, noted.","1290","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"Other survey data confirm Gallup’s findings. Last year, for example, the Pew Research Center found that sixty-five per cent of Americans believe the gap between rich and poor has increased during the past decade. Even more striking, sixty-nine per cent of respondents, including forty-five per cent of Republicans, said that the government should do “a lot/some” to reduce the income gap. Just twenty-six per cent of respondents said that the government should do “not much/nothing.”","1291","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"In addition to considering these findings, it is worth parsing the numbers in some of the recent academic studies. The paper by Kelly and Enns as well as the one by Luttig both use a sophisticated statistical model derived from economics (an error-correction model, if you must know) that can be difficult to interpret. The new paper by Ashok, Kuziemko, and Washington looks directly at data from the General Social Survey, which is conducted by the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center and has been carried out every year since 1972.","1292","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"Although the fitted trend line the authors present appears to show that the level of support for the proposition “The government ought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor” slopes slightly downward, the researchers acknowledge that they can’t statistically reject the hypothesis that it is actually flat—i.e., that support for redistribution hasn’t declined. Indeed, there is even a suggestion in the data that, since 2008, support might have increased a bit.","1293","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"The researchers say that it’s too early to tell whether their findings reflect a sustainable trend, which is fair. Interestingly, though, the General Social Survey also asks people what they believe the government’s spending priorities should be. In recent years, “assistance to the poor” has been moving up the list. In 1996, it was ranked tenth, behind things like health care, the environment, and Social Security. But in the 2010 and 2012 surveys it moved up to second place, trailing only education—a finding that appears to contradict the idea that the electorate is getting more conservative.","1294","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"Another important consideration in looking at attitudes toward inequality is whether voters adopt more liberal policy positions as they learn more about the issue. In an article collected in a 2013 book about political representation, the political scientists Jacob Hacker, of Yale University, and Paul Pierson, of the University of California, Berkeley, point to evidence from the American National Election Studies project, a long-running survey, that suggests having more information does change people’s attitudes. For many years, the survey has asked people whether it is the government’s responsibility to reduce the income gap between rich and poor. Typically, the positive responses were low—only about twenty-five per cent. In 2007, the survey changed the wording of the question, to detail how much money people at the top and bottom of the income distribution actually earned. “This time, 57 percent favored reducing income inequality,” Hacker and Pierson write.","1295","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"In a 2013 paper, four economists—Kuziemko; Michael Norton, of the Harvard Business School; Emmanuel Saez, of Berkeley; and Stefanie Stantcheva, of Harvard—reported some less supportive evidence. Using Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk platform, which pays people to take part in surveys, the economists presented their subjects with some pertinent information about inequality, such as how much money the rich make compared with the middle class, and the fact that average family incomes have grown more slowly during periods when the top tax rate was low. Then they asked the subjects some policy questions. Perhaps surprisingly, the researchers found that supplying information didn’t increase support for redistribution to the poor. Support for taxing the rich did go up, but not by very much. “Of course, a single paper can only say so much,” Kuziemko wrote in an e-mail. “But I do think our results cast some doubt on the argument that if only Americans knew about the high levels of inequality, they would surely demand more redistribution.”","1296","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"That sounds like a reasonable conclusion. However, it isn’t the only significant finding from the experiment. When the researchers presented to their subjects a slide showing that the estate tax currently affects only about 0.1 per cent of estates—the very richest ones—they found that this knowledge “has an extremely large positive effect on estate tax support, even increasing respondents’ willingness to write to their U.S. senator about the issue.” Since changing the way estates are taxed—by, for instance, eliminating the “step-up in basis” loophole—seems likely to be part of the Democratic platform in 2016, this result has immediate political implications. And, more generally, it suggests that giving people more information about specific inequities and policy proposals, as opposed to citing over-all statistics about inequality, can have a big impact on voters’ attitudes.","1297","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"So what’s the takeaway from all of this? It is important to acknowledge that rising inequality doesn’t, by itself, generate a surge in support for redistributive policies. It’s also a concern that the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act appears to have undermined support for guaranteed health-care coverage—although it’s not absolutely clear to me whether this finding reflects a shift against the redistributive subsidies that are part of the act, or a lack of enthusiasm for the reform in general. (Polling data from the Pew Research Center, the Kaiser Foundation, and other organizations suggest that the public has been cool on the A.C.A. since before it was passed, in 2010.) But taking all of the evidence together, my take is that a progressive policy agenda, if carefully presented, can still win popular support.","1298","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"To be sure, it isn’t enough to simply point to the rise in inequality and expect an outpouring of mass support for any and all liberal policies. The argument for each proposal has to be made on its own terms, and Americans still show little enthusiasm for anything that smacks of welfare. Would-be reformers also need to avoid alienating seniors, whose declining support for redistributive measures probably reflects a fear that such policies would come at their expense, in the form of cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Still, the polling data shows that a healthy majority of Americans believe that income and wealth should be more evenly distributed, and that a smaller, but steady, majority believe that the current situation justifies heavier taxes on the rich. That surely gives the Democrats something to work with.","1299","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"It all comes down to individual policies. In the cases of the estate tax, the “carried interest” deduction enjoyed by hedge-fund managers and private equity, and other loopholes that benefit the very wealthy, would-be reformers can appeal to the voters’ sense of fair play, which remains undiminished. In seeking to expand support for working families—for example, by expanding the earned-income tax credit—progressives can appeal to the widespread sympathy for the working poor. When presented in general or ideological terms, redistribution has always been a tough sell. But when the debate gets down to specific proposals, redistributive arguments can still win out.","1300","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling"
"I decided to learn to drive because I wanted to learn to drive. I wasn’t, I told anyone who would listen, searching for a metaphor of middle age, or declaring my emancipation from my pedestrian past, or making up for time wasted in the passenger seat. There’s a rich literature about learning to drive written by women, for whom it represents a larger emancipation from the feminine roles of enforced passivity, of sitting in place and accepting helplessness. That wasn’t my “issue.” I wanted to learn to drive because I wanted to make a vehicle move in an orderly direction forward and around corners and to necessary places.","1301","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"I didn’t know how to drive for reasons that seemed to me obvious and accidental and psychologically uncomplicated. My parents, who worked a few blocks from our apartment, didn’t have a car for a few brief years that happened to coincide with my teen-age ones. Then, in my early twenties, I found myself in New York, where people don’t have cars, and where, among a thousand enterprises in transportation, from learning to roller skate to mastering the transfer from the No. 6 train to the R to get to Times Square, taking the time to learn to drive seemed the least worthwhile. The years, and the decades, had flown past, and on that once-a-year summer occasion when we rented a car and set off for Cape Cod, my wife, Martha, who grew up in a semi-suburb of Montreal and had her license at eighteen, did the driving. She was a terrific, expert, careful driver, and the last thing we seemed to need in the family was another. I simply wanted to be her relief chauffeur—a middle-inning guy, able to go to the pond on an August morning or to the drive-in movie theatre on an August evening. I wanted to be able to get ice cream at night and cinnamon buns in the morning.","1302","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Of course, there were other, more ignoble motives pressing on the decision to learn. Even as a feminist in a feminist age, I sometimes felt that I was in the wrong seat. Instead of sitting where generations of fathers have sat, pressing down on pedals and cursing the competition on the road, I had spent decades in the traditional mother’s seat, filling her role—shushing the children when the driver was tired or looking for the exit, or holding out the paper bag of cookies to unseen, waiting hands in the back. When the rental-car man or the gas-station attendant approached the driver’s seat and saw me in the “wrong” one, I immediately glared and scowled in what I imagined to be a persuasive impersonation of a hugely overskilled driver, the kind whose license has finally been taken away by the cops, however reluctantly, after a lifetime of dangerous but entertaining high-speed, “Dukes of Hazzard”-like performance. (Though I accept that these gender roles are nine-tenths “constructed,” invented, and cast, still, that does not make it less of a temptation to play another: that the clown wants to play Hamlet does not mean he thinks that the actor playing Hamlet is actually a prince.)","1303","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"My immediate trigger, though, was simpler: my son, Luke, turning twenty, had to get his license—he was a sophomore at a liberal-arts college just out of town—and various Robert Bly–Iron John type scenarios of manhood achieved and passed on still existed somewhere in the Walter Mitty theatre of my mind. “Let’s learn to drive together,” I said. But where, in the typical contemporary memoir, the troubled youth and the alienated father would silently acknowledge their vexed journey toward expertise and adulthood, he merely gave me an opaque look and asked if I was really sure this was a good idea, and had I run it by Mom? “Your reflexes are a bit funny, Dad,” he said. I made a joke about being guys together, he mumbled something about “gender fluidity,” which he had been studying in college, and we agreed to go to the Department of Motor Vehicles together and take the test for learner’s permits.","1304","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"The D.M.V. has become such a byword for bureaucratic indifference and big-government horrors that it was nice to discover that the 125th Street branch, at least, was about as well-run a place as one could hope to find. As we waited, I insisted that the reason government bureaus could seem so bureaucratic was that, by their nature, they have to be inclusive, and they can’t inflict the basic market rationale of price differences upon their customers. If the privileged could pay more for quicker service, they would, but this would undermine the premises of citizenship. That first-class passengers get a shorter line through security claws at our idea of citizenship, which ought to include the notion that the rich and the poor suffer the indignities and delays of common civic cause equally. That this has never happened—the rich could buy their way out of Civil War conscription—doesn’t make it less of an ideal. I want David Koch waiting in line alongside his chauffeur to be checked for hidden bombs and razors.","1305","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"I was talking too much, and too quickly, because I was nervous beyond words about the test. I hadn’t taken a test in many years, and I was afraid that I hadn’t studied the little booklet of road rules well enough. People do fail the written test, and in New York State more than half of those who take the road test fail that one. “Dad, it’s easy—it’s multiple choice,” Luke said, as we waited to enter the test-taking room. “There will be two answers that are obviously wrong. Then there will be two sort of plausible ones. If you just choose the plausible ones at random you’ll get fifty per cent. Since you do know something, you’ll get more than half of that right for sure. You can’t help passing.” The American social truth—that what we spend years teaching our children is essentially to spot the two obviously wrong answers—was the essential truth of the D.M.V., too. The larger social truth Luke was touching on, that being good at passing tests has relatively little to do with being good at what those tests are supposed to be testing, in the end came to haunt my entire experience of learning to drive.","1306","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"I passed the test and got my permit, with a suitably grim photograph, and the very next week I signed up with a driving school in Manhattan that was supposed to be particularly good with later-in-life students. At five-thirty on a Tuesday afternoon, I got into the driver’s seat of a car parked outside my apartment building and advertised on the side as “Student Driver.” I noticed that various catchphrases had been laboriously written out in block letters on adhesive tape and stuck to the dashboard: “NOODLES!!!” and “BUSY BEE!!!” and “GSSLG!”","1307","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"“I love it, yuuusss, I love it!” Arturo Leon, my driving instructor, said with more enthusiasm than I expected, as I adjusted my mirrors, trying to recall how my father had always aligned these things. And then, to my shock—I expected to be eased into the pool, inch by inch—he had me pull out into the street and make a left turn on the adjoining avenue, and there I was—at rush hour on the Upper East Side, heading north among impatient taxicabs, doing what I suppose was a steady, frightened fifteen miles an hour, while the world roared and bleated around me, speeding past our little car. Arturo, I noticed, kept his foot alarmingly well away from the extra brake on his side in the specially prepared student car.","1308","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Panic enveloped me. Taxis were honking furiously—furious, I dimly realized, at me! “Let’s give him the hand,” Arturo said, showing me a gentle, palm-out wave. “Just give him the hand: ‘Yes, thank you for sharing.’ ” He was addressing the car alongside us as its driver yelled soundlessly. He smiled. We moved forward up the avenue. Driving was like a nightmare, or, rather, like a dream I had had many times at the age of six or seven, of being behind the wheel of my father’s car and moving forward, floating forward. I broke out in a sweat—up Madison into the South Bronx, incredibly doing this thing.","1309","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Though I kept my eyes mostly pointed rigidly ahead, in the moments when we stopped at a red light (“I want to see the floor under the car ahead of us,” Arturo would instruct me, and it took me a while to understand that by “floor” he meant the asphalt street surface; that, a city boy like me, he thought that everything flat and low on the ground was a floor), I got to study my teacher. Cherub-faced and immense, he worked nights as a d.j. with his brother, loved to sing scraps of old Motown songs as we drove, and thought that rush-hour Manhattan and the crowded shopping streets of Arthur Avenue and Third Avenue in the South Bronx, where he lived, were the perfect arena for learning to drive. As I drove, struggling to keep the terror down, Arturo kept up a non-stop patter. He was a great teacher and a champion talker, somehow managing to be both elaborately formal—he couched any direction, even a last-minute, life-saving one, as a polite request—and cheerily intimate: I learned about his Ecuadorean parentage and his immigrant upbringing, his failed marriage, his two beloved children, and his future prospects, both erotic and professional.","1310","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"“O.K., we’re going uptown, please continue straight ahead—excellent,” he would say casually, hissing the “xc.” And then: “I love it!” We would head north to approach the Madison Avenue Bridge, or the Willis Avenue Bridge, or the Third Avenue Bridge—all bridges of which I had previously been unaware. “Do I turn here?” I would say, my voice shaky, as livery drivers and cabbies raced around and ahead of me. “If you would just push the car slightly left just here?” he would reply. “Just slide over. Just slide into the left lane. Just look and signal and sliiide. Thank you! Thank you! Excellent. I’m so happy with the way you did that.” He started to sing: “Because I’m happy / Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof. / Because I’m happy / Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth.” And then: “Thank you for doing that so easily. And we’ll just continue here, and now I’m going to stop you here.” He nimbly slipped his foot sideways onto his own brake, as, coming off the bridge at my steady fifteen m.p.h., I narrowly missed a sixteen-wheeler coming the other way. The truck driver blasted his horn—his steam siren, really—and Arturo waved gently at him. “Let’s give him the hand, right here,” he said. “The hand means thank you, bless you, fuck you. The hand means everything we need it to mean. Oh, thank you so much for signalling to us! Sharing is caring!” He would smile serenely, while slipping in through his smile an obscenity directed at the truck driver for my benefit, and I would laugh and give the truck driver the hand, too. Then Arturo would lean back and let me drive while he told me about his kids—Bryan Armany and Hillary Alizé—and his struggles to keep them in a straight line at school, about his father’s bad health and his mother’s love.","1311","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"“Become the noodle!” he kept insisting, and I soon learned that this meant to relax completely, go limp from head to toe. His constant talk, I decided, was intended to make you become the noodle by not allowing you to think too much. Dread is always the product of imagination. You see the bad consequence coming and the image paralyzes your judgment. Arturo had me on the F.D.R. Drive at rush hour before I had a chance to think about it.","1312","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Two or three times a week, we would spend a couple of hours driving, up to the South Bronx and back again. (Luke did five hours, and it was a wrap: he was ready for the road test.) Arturo would have me crawl along Arthur Avenue and Third Avenue, learning the complicated timing necessary to avoid pedestrians crossing against the light, and then go out into the empty, boarded-over areas of the borough, to practice parallel parking and three-point turns. Then he would reward me by taking me out onto one of the big highways, the Bruckner or the F.D.R., where I could, unbelievably, go forty miles an hour and negotiate lanes like a cabbie, until I found the exit home.","1313","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Unlike everything else I’ve learned to do in midlife, driving negated the usual path of learning: the incremental steps, the breaking down and building up of parts, the curve we go up as one small mastery follows another. Driving, I realized, isn’t really difficult; it’s just extremely dangerous. You hit the gas and turn the wheel, and there you are—in possession of a two-ton weapon capable of being pointed at anything you like, at any speed you can go at, just by pressing a pedal a little bit harder. The poor people in the crosswalk—the guy in the tank top striding indifferently forward; the mother yanking at her child’s hand—had no idea of the danger they were in with me behind the wheel! I had no idea of the danger I am in doing the same thing, day after day. Cars are terrifying, and cars are normality itself.","1314","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"This discrepancy between difficulty and danger is our civilization’s signature, from machine guns to atomic bombs. You press a pedal and two tons of metal lurches down the city avenue; you pull a trigger and twenty enemies die; you waggle a button and cities burn. The point of living in a technologically advanced society is that minimal effort can produce maximal results. Making hard things easy is the path to convenience; it is also the lever of catastrophe. The realization of how close to disaster we were at every moment helped press my panic button, and, while Arturo’s singing and commentary reduced the panic some, I tried to find other ways to overcome it as well.","1315","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"One way to calm myself was to become my calm father. Whenever I think of him, I am in the back seat and I see the back of his head, his mesh driving gloves, and his calm voice debating a topic with his children improbably crowded in behind him. (My first memories of life are in the Volkswagen “bug” my parents bought in the late fifties, into whose tiny back seat they introduced, like clowns into a clown car, one child after another, until there were six.) To see him so is to do a terrible disservice to his accomplishments—a chauffeur is the last thing he was—and yet in another way it is to see him whole, if one translates the act of driving into an act of understated service. He thought little of doing a kind of drive-around of his six children and twelve grandchildren, now dispersed around the continent like pieces on a game board. From rural Ontario to Boston to Ann Arbor to Berkeley to Washington to New York—the driving would last fifteen or sixteen hours, and he would emerge, bearded and smiling. “I’ve never had an accident,” he liked to say. We were very close when I was a teen-ager, and I loved him more for knowing that I was not remotely like him: he was sound, solid, in his role as a dean paterfamilias to a campus—all things I never hoped to be. My not driving was, in some sense, a response to his driving all the time. We make ourselves in our father’s sunshine but also in his shadow: what he beams down we bend away from.","1316","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"He had been driving, he often recalled, since he was twelve, as a young boy on a farm in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, his family, unusually, Jews among the Pennsylvania Dutch. He first drove an Army-surplus jeep, used as a tractor, and at sixteen got his license. He often told me of how, as a teen-ager, having a car was the means not just to autonomy—though it was that: you could get behind the wheel and go to Atlantic City, to Provincetown, even to old Quebec—but to privacy. It enabled a lower-middle-class kid in a fractious, noisy extended family to be alone with his thoughts. He said to me once, when I was small, “You know, you can drive right across the country now without a stoplight.” The image stayed with me. (I suspect that the significant things we say to our children usually vanish, while incidental oddities linger.) I wanted to travel with him, but I left the driving to him.","1317","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Why, I wondered, had he never encouraged me to drive? Why had he not kept a car when I was a teen-ager? He gave me a driving lesson once—in Italy on a sabbatical leave, as it happened—and it had gone all right. But then he stopped, and he didn’t really have to; we didn’t have a car, that was true, but there were friends and rentals. If driving mattered so much to him, why would it not to me? Had he failed me in some way, or had I failed him in some way I was still not ready to recognize?","1318","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Learning to drive changed my perception of the city. Pre-modern peoples have to be persuaded that what they impute to sentient agency is actually the work of automatic forces: lightning, tides, the moon rising are not the result of gods or demons working their will but just things that happen from consciousless natural forces. I had to persuade myself that what I had grown to attribute to automatic forces was actually the work of agency. The crazy taxi-driver, weaving in and out of traffic, I had always viewed with what was, to my wife, undue calm—he was like a whirlpool in the river’s flow, just what was happening naturally. That he was making it happen, and should not have been, was not a thought entirely at home in my head. It had never occurred to me that the pulse and movement of traffic was not like the eddies and currents of rivers but a network of decisions made at frantic high speeds by coöperative and conflicting drivers. The deeper truth was that I accepted the action of cars as automatic forces because I thought, in effect, that my father was driving them all. I had always so trusted him up there in the front seat, as a benevolent natural force, that I extended that trust to anyone in that place.","1319","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"This opacity of agency in car driving, and the ways we try to surmount it, turns out to be the subject of intense academic study. Distilling an argument from some reading, most of it work created under the general aegis of the studies of street traffic done by the sociologist Erving Goffman, I had the sense that it all seemed to intersect on the idea that we regard cars as shells, closed homes, more than as mobile weapons. Traffic is a way of avoiding looking at other people’s faces. We like being in cars because they give us my father’s teen-age illusion of privacy, and as a consequence we are unduly surprised and even enraged when we are reminded that there are other people like us in them. Road rage is a function of mind blindness induced by the car’s enclosure: when we’re locked in our car’s little confession box, it’s easy to arrive at the illusion that we’re the only person out there. We consistently underrate the movements of cars as intentional objects, and then, in an instant, overrate them. A vehicle that obstructs our way is first a mute object in the maze to be avoided and then, suddenly, a menace. This is why the driver acting erratically, unexpectedly pulling ahead, or moseying down Madison at fifteen m.p.h., prompts “You idiot!” rather than “Are you O.K.?”","1320","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Arturo’s method, assuming that there was one, was, in part, to make driving a car more like walking on a sidewalk, full of recognitions and hand waving and early avoidance, tamping down the sudden shocks that the combustion engine is heir to. Driving so much with Arturo after reading the academics, I not only began to enjoy it but also began to like cars, and to see that driving is one of the last democratic things we do. I had long thought of cars as a weapon against civilization, and had said as much many times in print. They devoured cities, destroyed mass transit, assaulted walkers, greedily demanded parking lots where once there had been public space, and, worst of all, sent families out from dense cities into atomized suburbs. But now I saw that driving was in another way civilization itself: self-organizing, self-controlling, a pattern of agreement and coalition made at high speed and, on the whole, successfully. “Just signal and slide over,” Arturo would urge me on the highway, and, as I signalled, other cars—other drivers—actually let me slide over! No cop appeared at the edge of the road to enforce the rule. They just did! Swerving and sliding over is citizenship, and the startling thing is how commonplace and easy it is. It was the essential social contract at work at forty miles an hour. The promised approach of the self-driving car, though it might make the world easier for non-drivers like me—and, given how little I was improving, I thought it quite possible that I would remain a non-driver for life—would still mark a loss in courtesy. “Sharing is caring,” Arturo would sing out, again and again, and though he meant it somewhat sardonically, he also really meant it: we were sharing the public road and that alone was a way of caring for our fellow-drivers. Arturo’s all-purpose hand—the one that means “thank you,” “fuck you,” “who cares about you”—is the proper hand for a citizen. It broadcast civility, while keeping its private meanings to itself.","1321","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Along the way, Arturo tried to explain to me what he wanted me to do to prepare for the road test that Luke and I had scheduled together, for late October. Tactfully, he tried to get me to see that my job was not just to show that I could turn corners and do three-point turns and parallel park. More, it was to impress the license-giving tester with my readiness to do anything that was required of me, and to do it in a suitably deferential spirit. “They make their decision in the first ten seconds,” he explained, over and over. “In the first five seconds, just by looking at you. They want to see you work the mirrors, they want to see you check your blind spot—they want to see you work your blind spot.” He showed me how I needed to behave: twisting my neck around in the car to look over my shoulder, my neck bobbing back and forth inside my collar, like Rodney Dangerfield doing standup for an audience in the back seat.","1322","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"I complained that I saw what was behind me more clearly if I just faced front and looked in the rearview mirrors. “I know,” he said, sighing. “It doesn’t matter. You got to be the busy bee anyway! They make up their mind in the first second they look at you—it’s up to you to show them that you are a safe, skillful, and secure driver by the way you behave when you start up the car, even before you move an inch.” He gave me a brief, dispassionate breakdown of the character of the driving judges, who were joined together by pride of office. They liked skill, but they hated arrogance. They wanted humble drivers. As Luke had explained to me that the key to the written exam was that it was multiple choice, Arturo was telling me that the key to the road test was that it was not multiple choice, it was a game of Simon Says, call and response. The point was to figure out exactly what the tester wanted and then do it.","1323","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/drivers-seat"
"Over time, Arturo and I became friendly, exchanging confidences about our kids—we both had a boy and a girl, his daughter Hillary named admiringly after Mrs. Clinton, while his son, Bryan Armany, like mine, Luke Auden, had a first name he liked the sound of and the middle name of an artist he admired. We talked a lot about the difficulties of fathering: when to press hard, when to let up—when to be present and when to recede.

Dr. Johnson was once asked why he always rushed to look at the spines of books in the library when he arrived at a new house. “Sir, the reason is very plain,” he said. “Knowledge is of two kinds.

"Jean McConville had just taken a bath when the intruders knocked on the door. A small woman with a guarded smile, she was, at thirty-seven, a mother of ten. She was also a widow: her husband, Arthur, had died eleven months earlier, of cancer. The family continued to live in Divis Flats—a housing complex just off the Falls Road, in the heart of Catholic West Belfast—but had recently moved to a slightly larger apartment. The stove was not connected yet, so Jean’s daughter Helen, who was fifteen, had gone to a nearby chip shop to bring back dinner. “Don’t be stopping for a sneaky smoke,” Jean told her. It was December, 1972, and already dark at 6:30 P.M. When the children heard the knock, they assumed that it was Helen with the food.","1368","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Four men and four women burst in; some wore balaclavas, others had covered their faces with nylon stockings that ghoulishly distorted their features. One brandished a gun. “Put your coat on,” they told Jean.

"“I can remember trying to grab my mother,” her son Michael told me recently. He was eleven at the time. “We were all crying. My mother was crying.” Billy and Jim, six-year-old twins, threw their arms around Jean’s legs and wailed. The intruders tried to calm the children by saying that they would bring their mother back: they just needed to talk to her, and she would be gone for only “a few hours.” Archie, who, at sixteen, was the oldest child at home, asked if he could accompany his mother, and the members of the gang agreed. Jean McConville put on a tweed overcoat and a head scarf as the younger children were herded into one of the bedrooms. The intruders called the children by name. A couple of the men were not wearing masks, and Michael realized, to his horror, that the people taking his mother away were not strangers—they were his neighbors.","1370","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Divis Flats had been constructed in the late nineteen-sixties, in one of those fits of architectural utopianism that yield dystopian results. A “slum clearance” program had razed a neighborhood of narrow, overcrowded nineteenth-century dwellings, replacing them with a hulking complex of eight hundred and fifty units. To Michael McConville, Divis’s warren of balconies and ramps seemed like “a maze for rats.” By 1972, it had become a stronghold for the Irish Republican Army, which was waging an escalating guerrilla battle against the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and loyalist paramilitary groups. A nineteen-story tower stood on one edge of Divis. It was one of the tallest buildings in Belfast, and the British Army had established an operational post on the top two floors. Because this aerie was in the middle of enemy territory, there were times when the British could get to it only by helicopter. From the rooftop, British snipers traded fire with I.R.A. gunmen below. Michael and his siblings had grown accustomed to the reverberation of bombs and the percussion of gun battles. On bad nights, the children dragged their mattresses off the beds and away from the windows and slept on the floor.","1371","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The I.R.A. had disabled the elevators at Divis to hamper British patrols, so the masked gang hustled Jean and Archie McConville down a stairwell. When they reached the bottom, one of the men pointed a gun at Archie’s face, so close that he could feel the cold barrel on his skin, and said, “Fuck off.” Archie was just a boy, outnumbered and unarmed. He reluctantly ascended the stairs. On the second level, one of the walls was perforated with a series of vertical slats. Peering through the holes, Archie watched as his mother was bundled into a Volkswagen van and driven away.","1372","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The disappearance of Jean McConville was eventually recognized as one of the worst atrocities that occurred during the long conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles. But at the time no one, except the McConville children, seemed especially concerned. When Helen returned home, she and Archie went out to look for Jean, but nobody could—or would—tell them anything about where she had been taken or when she might be back. Some weeks later, a social worker visited the apartment and noted, in a report, that the McConville children had been “looking after themselves.” Their neighbors in Divis Flats were aware of the kidnapping, as was a local parish priest, but, according to the report, they were “unsympathetic.”","1373","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Rumors circulated that McConville hadn’t been abducted at all—that she had abandoned her children and eloped with a British soldier. In Belfast, this was an incendiary allegation: Catholic women who consorted with the enemy were sometimes punished by being tied to a lamppost after having their heads shaved and their bodies tarred and feathered. The McConvilles were a “mixed” family; Jean was born Protestant and converted to Catholicism only after meeting her husband. The family had lived with Jean’s mother, in a predominantly Protestant neighborhood in East Belfast, until 1969, when they were driven out, as internecine tensions sharpened. They sought refuge in West Belfast, only to discover that they were outsiders there as well. Several weeks after the abduction, on January 17, 1973, a crew from the BBC visited the apartment and taped a segment. As the younger siblings huddled on the sofa—pale children with downcast eyes, looking shy and frightened—the reporters asked Helen if she had any idea why her mother had left. “No,” she said, shaking her head. Agnes McConville, who was thirteen, noted, hopefully, that her mother was wearing red slippers when she was taken away. She added, “We’ll keep our fingers crossed and pray hard for her to come back.”","1374","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"But there was reason to believe that something terrible had happened to Jean McConville. About a week after she was kidnapped, a young man had come to the door and handed the children their mother’s purse and three rings that she had been wearing when she left: her engagement ring, her wedding ring, and an eternity ring that Arthur had given her. The children asked where Jean was. “I don’t know anything about your mother,” the man said. “I was just told to give you these.” When I spoke to Michael recently, he said, “I knew then, though I was only eleven years of age, that my mother was dead.”","1375","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"His siblings were not so quickly convinced. The act of “disappearing” someone, which the International Criminal Court has classified as a crime against humanity, is so pernicious, in part, because it can leave the loved ones of the victim in a purgatory of uncertainty. “You cannot mourn someone who has not died,” the Argentine-Chilean writer Ariel Dorfman once observed. Helen and Archie reported Jean’s abduction to the police, but in the files of the Royal Ulster Constabulary there is no record of any investigation at the time. McConville’s body did not turn up. And so some of the children held out hope for years that they had not been orphaned, and that their mother might suddenly reappear. Perhaps she had developed amnesia and was living in another country, unaware that she had left a whole life behind in Belfast. But, as decades passed without word, these fantasies became increasingly difficult to sustain. For all the gnawing irresolution, there was one clear explanation. Michael’s sister Susan, who was eight when Jean was taken, told me that she knew, eventually, that her mother was dead, because otherwise “she would have found her way back to us.”","1376","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"After several months of fending for themselves, the McConville children were separated by the state, and the younger ones were dispersed to different orphanages. The older ones found jobs and places to live. The siblings saw each other infrequently and never spoke of what happened to their mother. One by-product of the Troubles was a culture of silence; with armed factions at war in the streets, making inquiries could be dangerous. At one point, a posse of boys from the youth wing of the I.R.A. beat Michael McConville and stabbed him in the leg with a penknife. They released him with a warning: Don’t talk about what happened to your mother. As the children grew older, they occasionally saw their former neighbors around Belfast, and recognized individuals who had come to the apartment that night. But, as Archie McConville told me, “you can’t do nothing. They walk past you like nothing happened.”","1377","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Then, in 1994, the I.R.A. declared a ceasefire. Gerry Adams, the bearded revolutionary who was the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Republican movement, had entered into peace negotiations with the British government, attempting to persuade the I.R.A. to abandon armed resistance and tolerate a continued British presence in Northern Ireland. As Tim Pat Coogan observes in the 2002 edition of his book “The I.R.A.,” a peace deal would be visionary, but also highly risky for Adams, because “his life would not be worth a cent should it be thought that he was selling out the ‘armed struggle.’ ” Through perseverance and political savvy, Adams succeeded, and in 1998 he helped create the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the Troubles. As the peace process got under way, the I.R.A. agreed to help locate bodies that its members had buried in hidden graves during the seventies.","1378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Though Adams is the most famous face of the Irish Republican movement, he has long denied having been a member of the I.R.A. He maintains that he never played any operational role in the violence of the Troubles, and that he confined himself to the leadership of Sinn Fein. As the chief Republican delegate involved in peace negotiations, however, he was obliged to confront the matter of forced disappearances, and he met on several occasions with the McConville children. Adams himself grew up in a family of ten children, and he conveyed his sympathies to the McConvilles. “There is no doubt the I.R.A. killed your mother,” he said. He told them that he did not know who had authorized the killing or carried it out, or where Jean McConville was buried. But he pledged to investigate.","1379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Michael McConville told Adams that he wanted an apology. Adams parsed his words with precision. “For what it’s worth, I’ll apologize to you,” he said. “It was wrong for the Republican movement to do what they did to your mother.”","1380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The first person to speak publicly about involvement in the disappearance of Jean McConville was a former I.R.A. terrorist named Dolours Price. In 2010, Price revealed in a series of interviews that she had been a member of a secret I.R.A. unit called the Unknowns, which conducted clandestine paramilitary work, including disappearances. Price did not participate in the raid on the McConville house, but she drove Jean McConville across the border into the Republic of Ireland, where she was executed. McConville, Price claimed, had been acting as an informer for the British Army, providing intelligence about I.R.A. activity in Divis Flats. The order to disappear her came from the Officer Commanding of the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional I.R.A.—the man who held ultimate authority over the Unknowns. According to Price, the Officer Commanding was Gerry Adams.","1381","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Dolours Price liked to tell people that Irish Republicanism was in her DNA. As a little girl in Belfast, she sat on the knee of her father, Albert, and listened to stories about how, as a teen-ager in the forties, he had taken part in an I.R.A. bombing campaign in England. Her aunt Bridie Dolan, who lived with the family, had been horribly disfigured at twenty-seven, after accidentally dropping a cache of gelignite in an I.R.A. explosives dump. The blast blew off both of her hands, and permanently blinded her. “It was never a case of ‘Poor Bridie,’ ” Dolours’s younger sister Marian told the journalist Suzanne Breen, in 2004. “We were just proud of her sacrifice. She came home from hospital to a wee house with an outside toilet, no social worker, no disability allowance, and no counselling. She just got on with it.” Bridie was a chain smoker, and Dolours and Marian would light cigarettes and insert them between her lips.","1382","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"By the late sixties, Dolours was a striking and impetuous teen-ager, with a moon face, blue-green eyes, and dark-red hair. She and Marian attended teacher-training school, but she gravitated to radical politics, taking part in civil-rights demonstrations and travelling to Milan to give a talk on “British repression” at the headquarters of a Maoist political group. Tensions had persisted in Northern Ireland since 1920, when the Irish War of Independence led to the partition of the island, ultimately resulting in an independent republic of twenty-six counties in the south and continued British dominion over six counties in the north. The I.R.A. had its origins in that conflict, and after partition the organization devoted itself to trying to force the British to withdraw altogether. Catholics in the north were subjected to rampant discrimination in housing and jobs, and, with the advent of the Troubles, in 1969, these tensions exploded in violence. New paramilitary groups loyal to the British Crown were emerging, including the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defense Association, and that January loyalist mobs attacked civil-rights protesters as they marched from Belfast to Derry. In August, a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary fired a machine gun into Divis Flats, killing a nine-year-old Catholic boy, Patrick Rooney—the first child to die in the Troubles. The R.U.C. raided the Price house repeatedly during this period, suspicious of Albert Price’s I.R.A. connections. In 1971, the British reintroduced the controversial tactic of “internment”—imprisoning indefinitely, and without trial, anyone suspected of Republican activity. But the policy backfired, radicalizing a new generation of recruits to the Republican cause. The Provisional I.R.A., a more aggressive offshoot of the official I.R.A., began preparing for a sustained guerrilla campaign. Dolours Price set out to join the Provisionals.","1383","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Historically, women had enlisted in the I.R.A.’s female wing, known as the Cumann na mBan (Irishwomen’s Council). Dolours Price’s mother and grandmother had both been members of this group. But Dolours did not want to bandage men’s wounds, she said—she wanted to be “a fighting soldier.” The leadership of the Provisional I.R.A. convened a special meeting to consider her case, and, in August, 1971, Price became the first woman admitted to full membership in the I.R.A. She was twenty.","1384","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Marian soon joined her in the I.R.A. Dolours later said, “I should be ashamed to admit there was fun in it in those days.” People are often drawn to radicalism by a sense of community and shared purpose. In this case, there was also glory. I.R.A. members referred to themselves not as soldiers or terrorists but as “volunteers”—a signal that they were prepared to sacrifice their lives for the cause.","1385","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Educated, attractive young women had not been seen carrying guns on the rubble-strewn streets of Belfast before, and the Price sisters acquired an iconic glamour. “They were sassy girls,” Eamonn McCann, a longtime friend of the sisters, told me. “They weren’t cold-eyed dialecticians or fanatics on the surface. There was a smile about them.” One press account described them as “pretty girls who would finish their school work and then take to the streets armed, one or both hiding an Armalite rifle under their raincoat, to take part in gun battles with the British army.” The sisters became the subject of sexualized lore, with stories circulating about Marian, in a miniskirt, charming her way past a British Army checkpoint while driving a car full of explosives. At the time, there was a shopping center in Belfast called Crazy Prices, and, inevitably, the sisters became known as the Crazy Prices. Another friend of the sisters told me that Dolours was drawn to the I.R.A., in some measure, by “rebel chic.”","1386","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"During this period, Dolours crossed paths with Gerry Adams. He was a former bartender from Ballymurphy, a lean young man with sharp cheekbones and black-framed eyeglasses. Like Dolours, he had grown up in a Belfast family deeply rooted in the I.R.A. It is believed that Adams joined the organization as a teen-ager, in the mid-sixties. Several former I.R.A. volunteers confirmed to me that Adams was a member of the group, and a photograph taken at a Belfast funeral in 1970 captures him wearing the black beret that was an unofficial uniform of the organization. In March, 1972, the British government interned Adams on the Maidstone, a British prison ship, but in June he was released so that he could represent an I.R.A. delegation in secret peace talks with the British. Dolours and Marian Price picked him up and drove him into Belfast to rejoin the Republican leadership. (The talks were unsuccessful.) A U.S. diplomatic cable in January, 1973, reported that Adams was “an active Belfast military commander.”","1387","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Nevertheless, Adams did not carry out operations. In a 2010 documentary, “Voices from the Grave,” Dolours Price recalls, “Gerry didn’t allow himself to be in the presence of guns, or in any situation that would put him at risk of arrest.” Instead, he deputized operational work to his close friend Brendan Hughes, a compact man with bushy black eyebrows and a shock of black hair. Hughes, who was known as the Dark, brought military cunning to the job, along with a measure of glee. He lived “from operation to operation,” he said later. “Robbing banks, robbing post offices, robbing trains, planting bombs, shooting Brits, trying to stay alive.” To Dolours Price, Hughes seemed like “a giant of a man.” He inspired fierce loyalty from his subordinates, because he fought alongside them and “asked no volunteer to do what he would not do himself.”","1388","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Hughes had been a merchant seaman before joining the I.R.A., and one day a sailor he knew showed him a brochure for a new assault rifle from America—the Armalite. “We all fell in love with this weapon,” Hughes recalled. The Armalite was ideal for urban warfare: lightweight and powerful, with a retractable stock that made it easy to conceal. According to Hughes, Adams dispatched him to New York to procure Armalites, using a network of sympathetic arms dealers. Hughes devised an ingenious plan to ship the guns back to Ireland. In 1969, the Queen Elizabeth 2 began making stately transatlantic crossings between Southampton and New York. The ship had a crew of a thousand; many of them were Irish, and some secretly worked for Brendan Hughes. And so a ship named after the Queen of England was used to smuggle weapons to the I.R.A. On Belfast’s streets, graffiti heralded the guns’ arrival: “God made the Catholics, but the Armalite made them equal.”","1389","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"For much of the sixties, the I.R.A. had just a few dozen members, and was therefore easy to track. Now there were hundreds of recruits; more sophisticated tactics, with the advent of the Provisional I.R.A.; and new leaders, like Adams. The British authorities were caught off guard. When Brendan Hughes became active in the I.R.A., his father destroyed the family’s photographs of him, so that British forces could not identify him by sight. Similarly, pictures of Adams were so rare that, for a time, the British authorities could not say for sure what he looked like. In Adams’s autobiography, “Before the Dawn,” he describes British troops capturing his dog, Shane, and taking him for a walk on a leash, in the hope that he might lead them to his owner. Adams and Hughes became targets of assassination, and they perpetually moved among safe houses, counting on support from the community in West Belfast. Armored personnel carriers roamed the Falls Road and helicopters hovered overhead; local residents removed street signs to disorient British patrols, and rattled the lids of trash bins to sound the alarm. While Hughes and his men were fleeing soldiers in a foot chase, a front door might suddenly open, allowing them to duck inside. When Adams moved around the city during this period, he later wrote, he “avoided streets where there were stretches without doors.”","1390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In 1972, the British Army launched a clever operation. It set up a washing service called Four Square Laundry, issued coupons offering steep discounts, then sent a van into Catholic neighborhoods to pick up and drop off clothes. The coupons were color-coded, so the clothing could be subjected to forensic testing for traces of gunpowder or explosives, and then correlated with delivery addresses to identify houses that were being used by the I.R.A. The Four Square operation was exposed after the I.R.A. interrogated one of its members, Seamus Wright, and discovered that he had been working as a double agent for the British. Gunmen strafed the Four Square van, killing the driver; according to the I.R.A., they also killed two men who were hiding in a secret compartment under the roof. Dolours Price then drove Wright and one of his colleagues—a seventeen-year-old named Kevin McKee, who was also discovered to have been a traitor—into the Republic, where they were executed, and secretly buried, in the fall of 1972.","1391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"After I.R.A. leaders learned that the British were cultivating double agents, they established a unit to identify “touts”—informers—and other disloyal elements. Jean McConville moved to Divis Flats as this climate of paranoia was taking hold.","1392","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"One day when Michael McConville was a young boy, his father brought home two pigeons. Michael was allowed to keep them in “a wee box” in his room, he told me, and his father fostered an interest in pigeon racing. After the family moved to West Belfast, Michael and his friends began stalking derelict houses where pigeons roosted. Whenever he found a bird, he peeled off his jacket and cast it like a net over the animal, then smuggled it home under his sweater, adding it to his burgeoning fleet. West Belfast was a hazardous place for an adventurous kid, but Michael had no fear, he told me: “Most boys didn’t, being brought up in a war zone.” On one occasion, he scaled the façade of an old mill only to discover a unit of British soldiers encamped inside. Startled, they trained their rifles on him and bellowed at him to climb back down.","1393","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“You had no respect for the law, because all’s you seen is brutality,” Michael recalled. “The soldiers getting men against the wall, kicking their legs spread-eagle. That’s what put the seed in a lot of kids’ heads to join the I.R.A.” He sighed. “I don’t think the British had much of a clue about what they were starting.”","1394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Michael is fifty-three, slight and taciturn, with clipped gray hair, flushed cheeks, and his mother’s pursed mouth. When I visited him last summer, at the bright, modern house that he built in a rural area a short drive from Belfast, he showed me a framed photograph of his mother. It’s a famous image, the only surviving photo of Jean McConville: a grainy shot from the sixties taken outside the family’s old house, in East Belfast. Jean smiles tentatively at the camera, her dark hair pulled away from her face, her arms crossed. Three of her children are perched on a window ledge beside her, while Arthur crouches, grinning, in the foreground. Arthur was older than Jean; he had fought the Japanese in Burma during the Second World War. When their first child, Anne, was born, in 1954, Jean was only seventeen.","1395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"After Arthur died, it was a struggle to feed ten children, even with his Army pension. “She just wasn’t coping,” Michael said, adding that she had a nervous breakdown. When I brought up the claim that his mother was an informer, Michael asked, with indignation, “When would she have had the time?” She was constantly on her feet, he said, cooking stews or washing clothes on a scrubbing board in the kitchen sink. After Arthur’s death, Jean’s attention to cleaning took on a compulsive intensity. Because one child or the other was forever losing a button or needing some other repair, she always had a large blue safety pin—a “nappy pin,” Michael calls it—fastened to her clothes. It was her defining accessory.","1396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Not long before Jean McConville was taken away, she raised the suspicions of her neighbors. She and the children were home one night when they heard a man moaning in pain outside their front door. Jean cautiously opened the door and discovered a wounded British soldier sprawled on the landing. He had been shot. Jean tended to him, and brought him a pillow. “That’s just who my mother was,” Michael said. “She would have helped anyone.” The next day, someone painted the words “Brit Lover” on the front door. Jean had a brother, Tom, who sometimes visited from East Belfast. According to Susan and Archie, he occasionally came to Divis outfitted in an orange sash, the traditional Unionist symbol; to make such a provocation in a West Belfast Catholic neighborhood was an act of suicidal folly. Nevertheless, Jean had converted to Catholicism, and her children were Catholic. At the time of her abduction, her oldest son, Robert, was interned in prison for suspected activity in the Official I.R.A.","1397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Jean McConville’s one indulgence was a weekly outing to play bingo. One night, she was interrupted during the game by someone who told her that one of her children had been injured and that a car was waiting outside to take her to the local hospital. Several hours later, British soldiers discovered her wandering through the streets, barefoot and disoriented. Apparently, she had been detained by an armed group and then released. Her face was swollen and badly bruised—she had been beaten. When the soldiers brought her home, “she was talking in riddles,” Michael recalled. The children couldn’t figure out what had happened to her. They made her tea, and she smoked one cigarette after another.","1398","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"When his mother was taken away the second time, and did not return, Michael said, “There was no one to look after us. I kept getting put in different homes, but each time I would run away.” He recalled an orphanage where monks walked through the dormitory at night with a roving flashlight, taking boys from their beds. Michael was not abused himself, but his younger brother Billy, who was sent to a Catholic orphanage in Kircubbin, recently told a panel investigating past abuses that he had been sexually molested. Michael eventually ended up at a facility that was surrounded by a ten-foot electrified fence. “It was the best home I ever had,” he told me. A kind nun took an interest in him, and he started to pull his life together. He met his wife, Angela, when he was sixteen. He has had a steady career installing tiles, and, unlike several of his siblings, has avoided the ravages of drugs and alcohol. He and Angela have four children, and he boasted about them a bit. “I’ve tried my best, given the life I had, to do well with the kids,” he said.","1399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In South Africa, after the fall of apartheid, the government initiated a process of “truth and reconciliation.” So that a thorough record of past abuses might be compiled, perpetrators were offered immunity from prosecution in exchange for honest testimony. In Northern Ireland, where roughly thirty-six hundred people were murdered during the Troubles and some forty thousand wounded, there has been no comprehensive accounting. A recent report by Amnesty International criticizes the “piecemeal” investigations of historical abuses, and suggests that, “across the political spectrum, it is those in power who may fear that they have little politically to gain—and possibly much to lose—from any careful examination of Northern Ireland’s past.” In 1999, with the encouragement of Bill Clinton, the British and Irish governments established the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims’ Remains, and the I.R.A. agreed to identify the graves of nine people who had been murdered and secretly buried during the Troubles, but only after securing a promise that no criminal prosecutions would result. The I.R.A. declared that some of the disappeared had been informers, including Jean McConville. Michael and his siblings angrily rejected this characterization, yet they had little choice but to work with the I.R.A. to search for her remains.","1400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Much of the Irish landscape is dominated by peat bogs; the anaerobic and acidic conditions in the densely packed earth mean that the past in Ireland can be subject to macabre resurrection. Peat cutters occasionally churn up ancient mandibles, clavicles, or entire cadavers that have been preserved for millennia. The bodies date as far back as the Bronze Age, and often show signs of ritual sacrifice and violent death. These victims, cast out of their communities and buried, have surfaced vividly intact, from their hair to their leathery skin. The poet Seamus Heaney, who harvested peat as a boy on his family’s farm, once described the bogs of Ireland as “a landscape that remembered everything that had happened in and to it.”","1401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In the summer of 1999, Jean McConville’s daughter Helen learned, through two priests who were serving as intermediaries, that the I.R.A. had identified the place where her mother’s body could be found: a stretch of windswept coastline outside Carlingford, in County Louth, on the east coast of the Republic. As backhoes prepared to tear up the soil, Helen convened her siblings around a table. It was an awkward reunion. Many of them had not seen one another in years. Edgy and fractious, their grief still palpable, they were now in their thirties and forties but looked older; their faces were haggard, and the hands and forearms of the men were etched with blotchy, blue-black tattoos. When Jean’s children spoke of her, even to one another, they had a tendency to refer to her as “my mother.”","1402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“Where are we going to bury her?” Michael asked.","1403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"Some of her brothers had reservations. “We all live in Republican areas,” Jim said. “We don’t want no hassle from them.” He continued, “Them boys who done it, they’ll suffer for the rest of their lives. It is time to say forgive.”","1405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"For fifty days, the backhoes excavated, creating a crater the size of an Olympic swimming pool. The family’s sense of anticipation eventually gave way to despair: the I.R.A. had apparently been mistaken. “They made a laughingstock of us” when Jean was kidnapped, Agnes said, her mascara dissolving in tears. “They’re making another laughingstock of us now.” The search was called off, and the children returned to their homes. One of the men who had abducted Jean now drove a black taxi up and down the Falls Road. Occasionally, Michael hailed a cab and climbed inside only to discover this man behind the wheel. Michael never said anything—he couldn’t. He rode in silence, then handed the man his fare.","1407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"One afternoon in March, 1973, a woman answered the telephone at the headquarters of the London Times and heard a man reciting, in a soft brogue, the descriptions and locations of several cars that were parked in the city. “The bombs will go off in one hour,” he said.","1408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"It was two o’clock. Officials at the Times reported the call to the police while several reporters headed toward the closest bomb, which, according to the caller, was inside a green Ford Cortina parked outside London’s Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey. By two-thirty, police had arrived on the scene. A hundred-and-twenty-pound bomb lay underneath the car’s back seat. They called in the bomb squad and burst into an adjacent pub, The George, ordering the startled patrons to evacuate. A school bus had just deposited forty-nine children not far from the Cortina, and an inspector shouted at the teachers to get them out of the area.","1409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Plans for a coördinated bombing of central London had originated several months earlier, at a secret meeting in Belfast. The I.R.A. had planted hundreds of bombs in Northern Ireland, but Dolours Price, remembering her father’s bombing campaign in Britain during the forties, had argued for a bolder operation. In a 2012 interview with the Telegraph, she recalled, “I was convinced that a short, sharp shock, an incursion into the heart of the empire, would be more effective than twenty car bombs in any part of the north of Ireland.” Dolours attended the strategy meeting, along with her sister Marian and Brendan Hughes. According to both Dolours Price and Hughes, the meeting was run by Gerry Adams. Generally, the I.R.A. issued warnings before its bomb blasts, in order to minimize civilian casualties. But sometimes these warnings did not allow sufficient time for escape: in July, 1972, twenty bombs were detonated in a single day in Belfast, killing nine people, an episode that became known as Bloody Friday.","1410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“This could be a hanging job,” Adams told the group, explaining that if the perpetrators were caught they could be executed for treason. “If anyone doesn’t want to go, they should up and leave now.” Several people did so, but the Price sisters remained, and a team of ten was eventually selected to carry out the I.R.A.’s first bombing mission in England in thirty years. Although Dolours was only twenty-two, she was chosen to run the mission. She was, in her own words, the Officer Commanding “of the whole shebang.” The team was sent into the Republic for several weeks of weapons training. Cars were stolen at gunpoint, in Belfast, then repainted and sent to Dublin, where they were fitted with English license plates and shipped by ferry across the Irish Sea. Shortly before the day chosen for the attack, Price and her team filtered into London and checked into hotels.","1411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The plan was to plant the bombs in four locations in the morning, with timers set to detonate simultaneously that afternoon. By 7:30 A.M., all four cars were in position. The bombs were set to blast at 2:50 P.M. By then, if everything went according to plan, the bombers would have caught a flight back to Ireland.","1412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"But, unbeknownst to Price and her team, British authorities had an I.R.A. informer who had given them advance warning of the attack. Police had been instructed to be extra vigilant, and shortly after one of the bombs was planted, in a Ford Corsair outside Scotland Yard, a passing officer noticed that the number plate on the car did not match the year of the vehicle. Upon further inspection, police discovered the bomb in the back seat—and defused it. British officials, knowing that the bombers were likely trying to escape the country, issued an emergency directive: “Close England.”","1413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In the departures lounge at Heathrow Airport, police spotted a group of young people waiting to board a flight to Dublin. A dark-haired woman in a long coat appeared to be giving orders. It was Dolours Price. When police questioned her, she told them that her name was Una Devlin. An officer showed her an early edition of the Evening News, with a banner headline about the bomb discovered at Scotland Yard. She stared at it silently. In her handbag, police found, along with “a large quantity of makeup,” a spiral notebook with several pages ripped out. When experts examined the indentations on the pages underneath, they discovered traces of a diagram that depicted the circuitry of a timing device. Dolours was arrested, as was Marian Price; at the subsequent trial, the detective who interrogated Marian recalled that, at precisely 2:50 P.M., “she raised her wrist and looked very pointedly at her watch, and smiled at me.”","1414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Police explosives experts did not arrive at the Old Bailey until two-fifty, and could not defuse the bomb before it detonated. The blast shattered windows, blew a crater in the ground, and sent glass and twisted metal flying. A bomb in Westminster also went off. These two explosions injured more than two hundred people, and one man died of a heart attack. “There was no intention to kill people with the London bombs,” Hughes remembered. Dolours Price was less apologetic. “There were warnings phoned in, but people had stood about,” she said years later. “Some had even stood at office windows and been sprayed by broken glass when the car went up.” She added, “In Belfast, we gave fifteen-minute warnings. In London, we’d given them an hour.”","1415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The trial of the Old Bailey bombers took place in Winchester Castle, outside London, and lasted ten weeks. It was a sensational event, with the press drawn especially to the Price sisters; the Irish Times described them showing up in court each day “sprucely dressed” and adopting defiant poses. On the stand, Dolours was almost smug, insisting that she knew nothing of the operation. When a prosecutor asked about the timing device depicted in her notebook, she feigned confusion, mugging for the spectators—“He lost me.” Asked about her politics, she was less evasive, saying, “I would like to see the removal of the border and the establishment of a democratic Eire.”","1416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Eight bombers were convicted and received double life sentences. As the verdict was read aloud, they jeered at the judge, proclaiming their loyalty to the I.R.A. They also announced their intention to launch a hunger strike. As Padraig O’Malley points out in his 1990 book, “Biting at the Grave: The Irish Hunger Strikes and the Politics of Despair,” fasting as a form of protest had a history in Ireland dating back to pre-Christian times. In 1903, W. B. Yeats wrote a play, “The King’s Threshold,” about a poet in seventh-century Ireland who launches a hunger strike at the gates of the royal palace. Yeats describes: “An old and foolish custom, that if a man / Be wronged, or think that he is wronged, and starve / Upon another’s threshold till he die, / The common people, for all time to come, / Will raise a heavy cry against that threshold.”","1417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In 1920, Terence MacSwiney, an Irish politician who had been imprisoned in Brixton on charges of sedition, died after a seventy-three-day hunger strike. His case attracted international attention, and tens of thousands of people filed past his coffin after his death. “It is not those who inflict the most but those who suffer the most who will conquer,” MacSwiney had said.","1418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"When the Price sisters and several of their co-defendants began refusing food, they had clear demands. They wanted to be granted political-prisoner status and transferred to Northern Ireland so that they could serve their sentences closer to their families. “Each day passes and we fade a little more,” Dolours wrote, in a letter. “But no matter how the body may fade, our determination never will.” Most parents would panic at the thought of a daughter, barely out of her teens, announcing her intention to starve herself to death. But the Prices could situate this gesture within a proud tradition of dissent. Albert, after visiting his daughters, told the press, “They are happy. Happy about dying.”","1419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The British authorities, recognizing that they would face a crisis if one of the Price sisters perished, force-fed them daily. “Four male prison officers tie you into the chair so tightly with sheets you can’t struggle,” Marian later explained. “You clench your teeth to try to keep your mouth closed, but they push a metal spring device around your jaw to prize it open.” Guards then inserted a wooden clamp with a hole in the middle, and slid a tube through the hole. “They throw whatever they like into the food mixer,” Marian continued. “Orange juice, soup, or cartons of cream if they want to beef up the calories.” By January, 1974, people who visited Dolours expressed horror at her physical deterioration: she had lost a great deal of weight, her skin had turned waxen, and her hair had gone white at the roots. Her teeth had come loose under pressure from the clamp.","1420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"It was an impossible situation for the British government, which began to be attacked for force-feeding the Prices, though the sisters were otherwise likely to die. The standoff took a bizarre turn when thieves stole the Vermeer painting “The Guitar Player” from a museum in Hampstead, and, in ransom notes, threatened to burn it—“with much cavorting in the true lunatic fashion”—if the Price sisters were not moved to Northern Ireland. The Prices’ mother, Chrissie, told the press that Dolours, “who is an art student,” had pleaded that the Vermeer remain undamaged. (It was eventually returned, unharmed.)","1421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In May, 1974, the British government, under increasing public pressure, agreed to stop force-feeding the Prices. The sisters began losing a pound a day and, according to one medical assessment, were “living entirely off their own bodies.” Finally, Roy Jenkins, the British Home Secretary, assured the Prices that they could eventually be moved to Armagh prison, in Northern Ireland. That June, after two hundred and five days, they abandoned the strike. A transfer was secretly approved the following spring.","1422","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"Within an hour, they had landed in Northern Ireland. The Price sisters were overjoyed to be home but distressed about the timing of their arrival. In the preceding months, both their mother, Chrissie, and their aunt Bridie Dolan had died. The sisters had unsuccessfully petitioned for compassionate release to attend their mother’s funeral. Chrissie Price’s casket was carried through the streets of Belfast.

"In “On the Blanket,” a history of hunger strikes during the Troubles, Tim Pat Coogan notes that the decision to stop force-feeding the Prices had profound consequences, because the British government was effectively signalling that “henceforth any prisoner on hunger strike would be allowed to die.” In 1981, the hunger striker Bobby Sands did die, followed by nine other prisoners. As he lay dying, Sands engaged in a fateful stunt: he ran for a seat in the British Parliament, representing Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and he won.","1427","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"During the seventies, Gerry Adams was in and out of jail. In addition to his 1972 internment on the Maidstone, he was confined for three years in Long Kesh prison, where he shared a cell with Brendan Hughes. At some point, Adams began to think that there were limits to what the I.R.A. could achieve through violence. After Sands won his seat, Adams’s close aide Danny Morrison announced that Sinn Fein would henceforth run candidates in elections. In a famous formulation, he said, “Will anyone here object if, with a ballot paper in this hand and an Armalite in the other, we take power in Ireland?” The strategy of “the Armalite and the ballot box” represented a departure for the Provisional I.R.A.: by running for positions in the British administration in Northern Ireland, Adams and his colleagues could be perceived as implicitly acknowledging the administration’s legitimacy. Adams replaced the woolly sweaters of a West Belfast revolutionary with the suits and ties of a politician. In 1983, he, too, was elected a Member of Parliament, representing West Belfast.","1428","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Dolours Price spent six years in Armagh. Although she and Marian were no longer refusing food, they continued to deteriorate physically. In the 2002 radio documentary, Dolours explained the psychology of a hunger striker: “If you eat, you’re going to lose. You convince yourself of that when you embark on a hunger strike. You have to convince yourself, because your body is telling you it wants food, and you’re telling your body, ‘No, you can’t have food. . . . We will not win this struggle if I give you food.’ ” After the Price sisters forced the British government to bend to their aims, they found it difficult to overcome the profound resistance they had developed to eating. “We both ended up with very, very, very distorted notions of the function of food,” Dolours said.","1429","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"By the spring of 1980, Marian had lost so much weight that she was released from prison, after Humphrey Atkins, Britain’s Northern Secretary, judged her “in imminent danger of death.” Dolours was relieved that her sister had escaped a life sentence, but she felt abandoned. “I got really depressed,” she said later. “It was like I’d been separated from my Siamese twin.” In a letter, she described the crushing inertia of her days, her energy depleted, her body numb: “I move as a clockwork doll.”","1430","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"A cache of papers recently declassified by the British government reveals that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was closely watching the case of Dolours Price. Initially, Thatcher was unmoved. In one memo, she speculated that Price would rejoin the I.R.A.—“I doubt whether her old friends will let her alone when she is out”—and reminded her subordinates that the London bombing had caused a man’s death. (According to an autopsy, the heart attack that killed the man had actually begun before the bomb detonated.) In April, 1981, Tomas O Fiaich, an Irish cardinal, visited Price in Armagh, and reported to Thatcher. “From being a vivacious girl . . . she has become, at thirty, a gaunt spectre, prematurely aged and deprived of any further desire to live,” he wrote. He begged Thatcher for clemency, stressing that “even next week may be too late.” When Price entered Armagh, in 1975, her weight was a hundred and fourteen pounds. By the time the cardinal saw her, she weighed seventy-six pounds. Thatcher authorized her release.","1431","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Dolours Price did not rejoin the I.R.A. Instead, she moved to Dublin, where she avoided publicity and tried to establish a career as a freelance journalist. She began dating the actor Stephen Rea, whom she had met during the civil-rights protests of the sixties. Rea was a brooding, shaggy-haired Belfast Protestant who was sympathetic to the Republican cause. In 1980, he had helped establish Field Day, an Irish theatre troupe. Rea and Price were married at Armagh Cathedral in 1983. When asked about being married to a convicted terrorist, he would say, “That’s my wife’s past. . . . She doesn’t apologize for that, and I’m not going to apologize for her.”","1432","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Rea never had a formal relationship with the Republican movement, but he did have a bizarre connection to Gerry Adams. After a series of I.R.A. bombings in the late eighties, the Thatcher government announced a bafflingly misguided policy, which held that, on British television, the voice of anyone believed to be advocating paramilitary action must be muted. Actors were hired to dub interviews and speeches, and for years a small stable of Irish actors found occasional employment as the voice of Gerry Adams. One of the actors was Rea.","1433","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The terms of Dolours Price’s release held that she must obtain permission from the British government if she wanted to leave Northern Ireland. But, her defiance unchecked, she proceeded to move with Rea to London. According to friends, Price relished the cheekiness of this relocation. England’s tabloids did as well, noting that the bomber of the Old Bailey was now “sipping champagne with stars at the National Theatre,” where Rea was directing a play. Price’s effrontery was brought to the attention of Thatcher, and she made no secret of her frustration. “If she and her husband wish to live together, they can live together in Northern Ireland,” she wrote. But no action was taken against the couple.","1434","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Eventually, Price and Rea had two boys, Danny and Oscar, and the family moved back to Dublin. (In interviews, Rea said that he did not want to bring up his sons in England.) One of Rea’s closest collaborators was the Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, and in 1992 they released “The Crying Game,” in which Rea played the role for which he is perhaps most famous: Fergus, a decent and soulful man who happens to be a member of the I.R.A. In the story, Fergus is assigned to guard a kidnapped British soldier (played by Forest Whitaker) in the hours before his execution. They stay up all night, and Fergus develops a friendship with the soldier, hand-feeding him pieces of chocolate and comforting him when he cries, before taking him outside to be shot. While promoting the film, Rea said little about the fact that his wife had once occupied a similar role, guarding prisoners at gunpoint or driving them to their deaths. But in one later interview he discussed what it meant to be a member of the I.R.A., and described the “conundrum of people whose lives are a gesture.” Such people, Rea said, are often “not afraid of death, because your death is acceptable if you’re living for a cause.”","1435","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Belfast has ostensibly been at peace for two decades, but the city remains acutely divided. The borders between Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods are inscribed in the concertina wire and steel of the so-called “peace walls” that progress like fissures across the city. These towering structures maintain some degree of calm by physically separating the city’s populations, as if they were animals in a zoo. The walls are tagged with runelike slurs—K.A.T., for “Kill All Taigs,” a derogatory term for Catholics, on one side; K.A.H., for “Kill All Huns,” a reference to Protestants, on the other—and dwarf the squat brick houses and the unlovely council estates on either side, throwing them into shadow.","1436","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In one sense, the Troubles are over. The principal armed factions have long since decommissioned their weapons, and in most parts of Belfast it is safe to walk the streets. The city center is dominated by the same chain stores—Tesco, Caffè Nero, Kiehl’s—found in the other urban centers of Western Europe, and most residents will tell you that they want Belfast to become famous for something other than conflict. Several people informed me, with pride, that the local film-production facility, Titanic Studios, is where “Game of Thrones” is shot. One popular tourist attraction is the Troubles Tour, in which ex-combatant cabdrivers guide visitors to flashpoints from the bad years, decoding the ubiquitous murals that conjure famous battles, martyrs, and gunmen. The effect is to make the Troubles seem like distant history.","1437","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"But there are at least as many peace walls in Belfast today as there were at the time of the Good Friday Agreement. Residents still live in neighborhoods circumscribed by religion, and ninety-three per cent of children in Northern Ireland attend segregated elementary schools. Bus stops in some parts of the city are informally designated Catholic or Protestant, and people walk an extra block or two to wait at a stop where they won’t fear being hassled. I arrived in August, just after “marching season,” when Unionists commemorate the Battle of the Boyne and other bygone victories by lighting bonfires and staging belligerent marches. Hundreds of Union Jacks still fluttered in Protestant neighborhoods. Catholic areas were decked out with the Irish tricolor, and with Palestinian flags—a sign of solidarity and a signal that, even now, many Republicans in the north consider themselves an occupied people.","1438","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Two years ago, Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, chaired a series of multiparty negotiations about unresolved issues in the Northern Ireland peace process; the talks foundered, in no small measure, over the issue of flags. Tribalism and its trappings remain so potent in Belfast, Haass told me, that the various sides could not agree on how to govern the display of regalia. When the Belfast city council voted, in 2012, to limit the number of days that the Union Jack could be raised outside city hall, protesters tried to storm the building, and riots erupted throughout Northern Ireland, with Unionist demonstrators throwing bricks and petrol bombs.","1439","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"To an outsider, the sheer weirdness, and attendant inconvenience, of living in a divided metropolis can be difficult to fathom. When I was driving through Belfast with Michael McConville, we reached a street that threaded between a Catholic neighborhood on the left and a Protestant one on the right. I noticed a Subway franchise along a strip of businesses on the Catholic side, and asked if local Protestants might cross the street to buy a sandwich.","1440","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"One morning, I visited Billy McKee, one of the founders of the Provisional I.R.A., in a small brick house in West Belfast. Born in 1921, five years after the Easter Rising, he joined the I.R.A. in the thirties, acquiring a reputation as a formidable combatant. When Brendan Hughes was a boy, the reverence in his family for Billy McKee was so deep that he felt he should “genuflect” every time he passed McKee’s house. McKee was said to be armed at all times, and on one occasion, in a back room after a funeral, Hughes contrived to brush up against him and felt a .45 concealed beneath his belt.","1442","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"McKee came to the door dressed in a dark suit, having just returned from Mass. His hair was white and spiky, in the style of Samuel Beckett. As a clock ticked loudly in another room, I asked about the disappearance of Jean McConville. McKee said that he played no role in the decision to kill her. He was in prison in 1972, and was ceding control of the I.R.A. to other leaders. But he insisted that killing McConville was the right thing to do, because she was a tout. “I would have had her executed and left her there,” he said, with a level gaze. “I couldn’t understand why they took her away to disappear her.”","1443","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"When I told him that I was curious about the people who were responsible for that decision, McKee scowled, worrying his dentures with his tongue, so that they slid from one side to the other. “What would happen if I knew and I told you, and they all got arrested?” McKee said. “I would be the axe man. I wouldn’t like to put my enemies in jail, never mind some of my friends.”","1444","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"I expressed surprise that, in a city like Belfast, where everybody knows everybody else, it was so difficult to solve a notorious murder. “I don’t think anybody’s stupid enough to mention names,” McKee said. Then he muttered, “Too dangerous.” He shuffled with me to the door, and said, “If you see any of my old friends, tell ’em I’m still breathing.”","1445","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"If McKee is an unreconstructed militant who speaks without equivocation about the role that he played in the armed struggle, Gerry Adams has in recent decades gone through a metamorphosis. As the peace process got under way, during the nineties, Adams continued the transformation of his public persona from international pariah to statesman and champion of peace. Today, he is a Member of the Irish Parliament, representing County Louth, and Sinn Fein is an ascendant political party both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic. Adams is widely credited, even by his detractors, with having played an instrumental role in ending the Troubles. Yet he still maintains that he was never a member of the I.R.A. “Everybody knows he was in the I.R.A., except for Gerry,” Michael McConville said. At the height of the Troubles, there was an obvious motive to deny the affiliation: a charge of “membership” in the I.R.A. was enough to send you to prison. With the advent of peace negotiations, there was a further incentive for Adams to distance himself from his armed comrades—British officials could deal with him and not risk charges that they were negotiating with a terrorist. But if Adams initially crafted a fiction out of political expediency, he chose to stick with it, even after some of his closest collaborators unburdened themselves. In 2001, Martin McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, admitted publicly that, in the early seventies, he had been the second-highest-ranking member of the I.R.A. in Derry. This acknowledgment does not appear to have hurt his political career; McGuinness has won three elections since 2001.","1446","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Adams is now sixty-six and a grandfather, and his evolution into an approachable grandee has found its surreal culmination on Twitter. He intersperses studiously boring tweets about small-bore political issues with a barrage of cat pictures and encomiums to sudsy baths, rubber duckies, and Teddy bears. (“I do love Teddy bears,” he told the BBC. “I have a large collection of Teddy bears.”) One characteristic tweet, from last January: “Dreamt I was eating Cream Eggs. Woke up this morn. Pillow & beard covered in chocolate & cream thingymebob.” The Irish writer Damien Owens has likened all this to “Charles Manson showing you his collection of tea cosies.” But, cumulatively, Adams’s tweets suggest the giddiness of a man who has defied some very long odds. In 1984, Adams told a reporter that he had a ninety-per-cent chance of being assassinated. Later that year, he was shot and nearly killed by loyalist gunmen, and during periods of captivity he was tortured by British authorities. Improbably, Adams survived the conflict—and, more improbably, he flourished.","1447","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The new Gerry Adams never completely eclipsed the old one, however, and this may have been a conscious choice. The journalist Fintan O’Toole once observed that the ambiguity of the Adams persona was essential to the peace process: in order to participate in the negotiations, Adams had to be accepted as a democratic politician; but, in order to deliver the desired result, he needed to exercise enough control over I.R.A. gunmen so that if he ordered them to lay down their weapons they would comply. Perhaps in the interest of preserving this flexibility, Adams perfected a dog-whistle style of political rhetoric. Asked about his role in the armed conflict, he has said, “I’m very, very clear about my denial of I.R.A. membership. But I don’t disassociate myself from the I.R.A.” Adams is beholden to multiple constituencies, and for some faction of supporters his charisma has always derived, at least in part, from the whiff of cordite. At a public event in Belfast in 1995, Adams was delivering a speech when someone shouted, “Bring back the I.R.A.!” Adams responded, “They haven’t gone away, you know.”","1448","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Traditionally, Irish journalists have shown surprising deference to Adams’s sophistry about his role in the armed struggle. To be sure, Adams has never been convicted of a violent crime, or of any I.R.A.-related offenses. But as a young man he often published essays in a Republican newsletter, under a pseudonym, and in 1976 he wrote, “Rightly or wrongly, I am an I.R.A. volunteer.” Even so, most press accounts simply recycled his denials, and, because the I.R.A. was so disciplined, none of his comrades spoke out to contradict him.","1449","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"During the peace process, however, many rank-and-file members of the I.R.A. felt surprised and betrayed when Adams accepted the legitimacy of a government in Northern Ireland that remained part of the United Kingdom. Many also questioned his willingness to surrender the weapons they had amassed. Some former volunteers became so disillusioned by Adams’s concessions that they broke the code of silence and told their stories to the press.","1450","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In 2001, Ed Moloney, a veteran reporter for the Irish Times and other newspapers, published a landmark revisionist account, “A Secret History of the IRA,” which stated explicitly that Gerry Adams had been a military commander responsible for the Belfast Brigade. Adams and Moloney had known each other for decades, and had enjoyed a cordial relationship during the Troubles, meeting occasionally in a back room on the Falls Road; Adams would make a pot of tea and Moloney would interview him. Once, after a long session in Moloney’s hotel room, Adams stayed and slept on the floor. But their relations had grown strained by the time “The Secret History of the IRA” was published, and Adams accused Moloney of “innuendo,” declaring, “I have not been and am not a member of the I.R.A.”","1451","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"As Moloney was preparing the book for publication, he was approached by administrators at Boston College about creating an oral-history project that would gather accounts by paramilitaries from both sides of the Troubles. The idea excited him. Many of the combatants were still alive, and their testimony could provide an unparalleled resource for future historians—an exception to the rule of omertà. Given the sensitivities, Moloney pointed out, each interview would have to be conducted in secret, and remain secret until the participant died. “These people could be shot if it was discovered they were talking to us,” he told me. “They were taking a huge risk.”","1452","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland were too insular and suspicious for graduate students with tape recorders to make headway, so Moloney suggested an unorthodox solution: finding interviewers who had participated in the Troubles. For the Unionists, Moloney suggested a loyalist named Wilson McArthur; for the Republicans, he proposed a former I.R.A. volunteer named Anthony McIntyre, who had spent seventeen years in prison for the murder of a U.V.F. man. McIntyre, who was Moloney’s friend and source, had obtained a college degree in prison, and had gone on to write a dissertation on the Troubles at Queen’s University in Belfast. He had a gruff, genial manner, and was at ease with retired revolutionaries, which suggested that they might open up to him, on tape, about secrets they had kept for decades. They did. “It was cathartic,” a former I.R.A. member named Richard O’Rawe said of his interview with McIntyre. “I cried like a baby.”","1453","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"This clandestine undertaking became known, to the people who were aware of it, as the Belfast Project. One of McIntyre’s subjects was the man still widely known around Belfast as the Dark: Brendan Hughes. They were close, having served together in prison. When I visited McIntyre and his wife, Carrie, at their home, in Drogheda, a small city between Dublin and Belfast, they showed me photographs of Hughes giving Carrie away at their wedding. McIntyre and Hughes shared a deep antipathy toward Gerry Adams. McIntyre disapproved of Adams’s engineering of the Good Friday Agreement, and his interview questions reflected this animosity. But Hughes required no prodding to express anger at Adams. He and Adams had been close collaborators for years, but when Adams proved willing to compromise on the question of a united Ireland, in the interest of a peace deal, Hughes was incensed: Adams had been his Officer Commanding, the man who gave him orders to kill. Adams’s denial of his own I.R.A. past left Hughes and others “to carry the responsibility of all those deaths.” Everybody knows that Adams was in the I.R.A., Hughes told McIntyre. “The British know it. The people on the street know it. The dogs know it.”","1454","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Terry Hughes, Brendan’s brother, told me that Brendan felt that he had been unforgivably misled. He had been fighting a bloody war against British rule while Adams was quietly laying the foundation for a peaceful compromise. “There was a master plan,” Terry said. “Unfortunately, Brendan wasn’t told.”","1455","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Hughes confided to McIntyre that he felt like “a patsy,” and insisted that he had “never carried out a major operation without the O.K. or the order from Gerry.” Adams, in the 1976 essay referring to his membership in the I.R.A., wrote about the moral decision to use violence, maintaining that “only if I achieve the situation where my people genuinely prosper can my course of action be seen . . . to have been justified.” The Good Friday Agreement did not deliver the ends that Hughes and others had counted on to justify the I.R.A.’s brutal means. Adams’s political turn forced his subordinates to reappraise the righteousness of their own killing.","1456","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Divis Flats was demolished in the nineteen-nineties, except for the tower where the British had their observation post. In the years after the Good Friday Agreement, Brendan Hughes lived alone in an apartment at the top of the tower. Demoralized by the things he had done, he spent his days chain-smoking by a picture window, looking out over Belfast, past the peace walls and church steeples to the shipworks where, a century earlier, the Titanic was built. “I always got the sense that he lived a large part of his life on that windowsill,” Carrie McIntyre said. “And he couldn’t either jump out and end it all or jump back in and start really living.”","1457","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The Divis apartment is where McIntyre interviewed Hughes about the killing of Jean McConville. “She was an informer,” Hughes said. “She had a load of kids.” Hughes told McIntyre that McConville’s children had been acting as spies for the British Army, “gathering information for her, watching the movements of I.R.A. volunteers around Divis Flats.” She was exposed, Hughes continued, when a radio transmitter was discovered in her flat. According to Hughes, the I.R.A. learned of the transmitter when one of the McConville children mentioned to one of Hughes’s men that “his mammy had something in the house.”","1458","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Hughes sent his men to confront McConville, and they took her away for interrogation. According to Hughes, she confessed to being a tout. The I.R.A. confiscated the transmitter and released her onto the streets. This could align with the night when Jean McConville was taken from the bingo parlor, but when I asked Michael McConville about the transmitter he told me that Hughes must be mistaken—because no such transmitter existed. He and his siblings knew every nook of their apartment; if Jean had hidden such a device on the premises, he would have found it. Michael also dismissed the idea that he and his siblings had been spies. In the oral history, Hughes says that, a few weeks after McConville’s interrogation, “another transmitter was put into her house and she was still coöperating with the British.” At this point, a decision was made to kill her, and a “special squad was brought in” to carry out the operation.","1459","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“There was only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed,” Hughes told McIntyre. “That fucking man is now the head of Sinn Fein.” At the time, he continued, a senior I.R.A. official named Ivor Bell argued that they should leave McConville’s body on the street, just as Billy McKee would have done. But, according to Hughes, McConville’s gender would have generated bad publicity for the Provisional I.R.A., and so Adams pushed to disappear her. Recalling Adams’s subsequent meetings with the McConville children, Hughes said, “He went to this family’s house and promised an investigation into the woman’s disappearance. . . . The man that gave the fucking order for that woman to be executed! Now, tell me the morality in that.”","1460","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Hughes fell into a coma in 2008. Gerry Adams visited the hospital and sat, in silent vigil, by his bed. The two men had not spoken in years. Hughes had told friends, “There was a time in my life when I would have taken a bullet for Gerry. Now I’d put one in him.” When Hughes died, his casket was paraded through West Belfast, and thousands of people turned out, in frigid temperatures, to pay their respects. At one point, a figure in a dark overcoat shouldered through the crowd: Adams. He solemnly insinuated himself among the men bearing the coffin. “Brendan was a Republican icon,” Terry Hughes told me. “Gerry had no choice. He had to associate himself with that.”","1461","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Dolours Price also attended the procession. She, too, had split with Adams, and she wrote a scathing open letter, deriding him as a “lonely figure” who was “clearly uneasy” at the funeral of his former friend. If Adams could come clean about his past in the I.R.A., Price suggested, he might “feel better.” She noted that Adams had a habit of wrapping himself in the mantle of people who were no longer alive to snatch it back. At one point, Adams suggested that, had Bobby Sands survived, Sands would have supported the peace process. In an article, Price replied, acidly, “I often wonder who would speak for me had my circumstances in Brixton prison reached their expected conclusion. What praises would I be singing of the Good Friday Agreement?”","1462","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Price also recorded an oral history for the Belfast Project. When her life was a gesture—a headlong push for a united Ireland—it possessed a certain moral logic. But the Good Friday Agreement robbed her of that certainty. “Dolours was a woman who was deeply traumatized by what she had done,” McIntyre told me. Like many people who were drawn to the I.R.A., she saw herself as a member of the left, yet she had participated in forced disappearances—an atrocity, McIntyre pointed out, that is the “calling card of the war criminal, whether it’s in Chile or Kampuchea.”","1463","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In February, 2001, Price attended an I.R.A. event to commemorate the death of a hunger striker, and announced, in an impromptu speech, “Gerry Adams was my commanding officer.” She added that she had not endured “the pangs of hunger strike just for a reformed English rule in Ireland.” Shortly thereafter, McIntyre visited Price’s home, in the seaside town of Malahide, outside Dublin, where, surrounded by memorabilia from her I.R.A. days, they conducted a series of interviews. Price spoke about her role in the disappearances and, in particular, about her grief over the death of Joe Lynskey, a close friend of hers. Lynskey, who was known as the Monk—because he had trained for the Cistercian order before joining the armed struggle—was a brigade intelligence officer and an ardent believer in the mission of the Provisional I.R.A. In 1972, it emerged that he had been having an affair with the wife of another I.R.A. man, and had tried to have the man killed. The I.R.A. secretly sentenced Lynskey to death, and Price was told to drive him across the border to his execution. She picked him up at his sister’s house, on the pretext that he was being called to a meeting in the Republic. Lynskey walked out with a little overnight bag, as though he were leaving for a weekend in the country. As they drove south in silence, Price realized that Lynskey knew where they were going. He was a large man: he could have overpowered her. Instead, he sat there, meekly, with his bag in his lap. “She wanted him to get up and escape,” McIntyre recalled. When she handed him over, in County Monaghan, “Lynskey hugged her and told her not to worry.” His body has never been recovered.","1464","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Price informed McIntyre, before one of their recording sessions, that she wanted to go on the record about the role that she had played in the disappearance of Jean McConville. By this point, Price and McIntyre were good friends; she later became godmother to his son. “As a historian, I would love to get this,” McIntyre told her. “As your friend, I have to warn you. You have children. If you commit to being involved in the McConville disappearance, your children will bear the mark of Cain.”","1465","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"One day in the summer of 2003, a man walking on Shelling Hill Beach, near Carlingford, noticed a piece of fabric in the sand. He reached down to examine it and felt something hard: a human bone. When the authorities exhumed the remains, they found the skeleton of a middle-aged woman, still in her clothes. A forensic examination concluded that the cause of death was a “gunshot wound to the head.”","1467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"At a nearby morgue, the children of Jean McConville were ushered into a room, one by one, so that they could examine the clothing, which was laid out on a table. Archie went in first, but he couldn’t bear to look. Instead, he asked a question: “Is there a nappy pin?”","1468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"A police officer surveyed the garments and said no. Then he folded over a corner of fabric—and there it was. Thirty-one years after Jean McConville vanished, her body was found. She was buried in November, 2003. The streets of West Belfast were typically crowded with kids on bikes and people lounging in front of their homes. Someone who attended the funeral told me that, when the procession passed through, everything was eerily quiet, as if the locals had been told to stay away—as if they were shunning the McConvilles once again.","1469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In an effort to challenge the allegation that Jean McConville was a tout, her children made a formal request to Baroness Nuala O’Loan, the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, to launch an inquiry into the case. Normally, British authorities would neither confirm nor deny whether an individual had worked for them as an informer, but O’Loan found that “the circumstances of the McConville family are most exceptional.” After consulting the files of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British military, O’Loan produced an official report, in 2006, which held that McConville “is not recorded as having been an agent at any time.” In O’Loan’s judgment, McConville “was an innocent woman who was abducted and murdered.”","1470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"At the time that the O’Loan report was released, the oral-history project at Boston College was a secret. But Price had been showing signs of increasing anxiety. In 2001, police raided her home and discovered several stolen prescription pads, an indication that she had been abusing prescription drugs. Her marriage to Stephen Rea ended in divorce, and her behavior became erratic. She showed up drunk at Maghaberry Prison and demanded to visit a hunger-striking inmate. She was accused of stealing a bottle of vodka from a supermarket. (In court, she blamed a “momentary lapse of concentration,” adding, with a flash of her old pride, that it was not in her “temperament or breeding” to shoplift.) Price began receiving treatment at a mental-health facility in Dublin.","1471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"“One of the most remarkable aspects of the Troubles was that, with a few exceptions, the people that I know who did these terrible things were all perfectly normal people,” Ed Moloney told me. “This wasn’t some band of robbers who were thieving and raping for personal profit. This was war. They were all nice killers. I felt pity for them. They were victims of circumstances beyond their control.” Sometimes Price felt agonizing remorse for the lives she had ruined; on other days, she was defiant, even about McConville, insisting that the death sentence was appropriate for an informer in wartime. But, whatever her feelings of contrition, Price seemed intent on at least acknowledging her past acts.","1472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"On February 21, 2010, the Belfast tabloid Sunday Life published a story linking Price to the disappearance of McConville. “In a taped confession, Old Bailey Bomber Dolours Price has admitted driving the mum-of-10 to her death,” the article reported, adding that Price claimed that the disappearance was “masterminded” by Gerry Adams. The paper quoted Michael McConville’s sister Helen calling for the arrest of Price and Adams. “It’s disgusting that the people involved in my mother’s murder are still walking the streets,” she said. “Adams and Price might not have pulled the trigger, but they are as guilty as the people who did.”","1473","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Adams issued an angry denial, observing that Price was “a long-standing opponent of Sinn Fein and the peace process,” and that she “clearly has her own issues to resolve.” But it was unclear whether Price had made this inflammatory disclosure directly to Sunday Life. The article’s author, Ciaran Barnes, wrote that he had listened to Price’s taped “confession” but did not say explicitly that she had made these disclosures to him. Instead, he asserted that Price had “made taped confessions of her role in the abductions to academics at Boston University.”","1474","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

But the Sunday Life article contained the first public suggestion that Price had given an interview to Boston College. Moloney and McIntyre are both adamant that the tabloid was not given access to Price’s recording, and point to the mistaken reference to “Boston University” as proof. They also note that, in Price’s interview with Anthony McIntyre, she never speaks of Jean McConville. Moloney thinks that Sunday Life likely obtained a recording of an interview that Price had given to the Irish News, and that the mention of the oral-history project was a clumsy effort to launder the interview’s provenance. (Allison Morris, the journalist who interviewed Price for the Irish News, strongly denied this claim, saying, “The interview never left my office.” Ciaran Barnes said only that it would be “remiss of me to talk about my sources.”)","1475","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In March, 2011, the British government contacted the U.S. Department of Justice and explained that a criminal investigation had been initiated into McConville’s murder. Investigators at the Police Service of Northern Ireland wanted to consult the oral histories of Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price. If the I.R.A. had found McConville’s body, her case would have been covered by the immunity clause. But, because her remains were discovered by a civilian, the authorities were free to investigate—and bring charges. A subpoena was issued to Boston College, and in a legal filing the U.S. Attorney in Massachusetts declared, erroneously, that a Sunday Life reporter had been “permitted to listen to portions of Ms. Price’s Boston College interviews.” Moloney and McIntyre panicked. Turning over the interviews would not only violate the college’s promise to withhold an oral history until the subject’s death; it would also set a dangerous precedent. In an e-mail to administrators in Boston, Moloney wrote, “I would bet the mortgage that at this moment, there are teams of lawyers working in the bowels of the British government trying to discover ways to force B.C. to surrender the names of other possible interviewees.” The police simply could have asked Sunday Life for the recording, Moloney pointed out to me. In his view, they went after the Boston College archive because “they wanted to get the entire trove, for intelligence purposes.”","1476","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Moloney argued that there was a political aspect to the investigation. The police in Northern Ireland had made no serious effort to solve the McConville case until the notion arose that doing so might implicate Gerry Adams. Many police officers in Northern Ireland were former members of Special Branch and the Royal Ulster Constabulary—and for these men and women Adams was an arch antagonist. “At least in the back of their minds, there was the knowledge that we could get that fucker,” Moloney said. “All roads in that story were going to end at his door.” Tellingly, the British authorities hadn’t launched a broad-based inquiry into past atrocities on all sides; indeed, many appalling crimes committed by Unionist paramilitaries—and by state authorities—have not been investigated to this day. “They’re not digging up all the bodies,” Moloney said. “They’re being very selective.”","1477","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In August, 2011, a second subpoena was issued, seeking any interview in the archive that contained “information about the abduction and death of Mrs. Jean McConville.” A federal judge in Massachusetts ordered Boston College to hand over the material to the British government. John Kerry, who was then the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, appealed to Attorney General Eric Holder and to Hillary Clinton, who was then Secretary of State, to push for the subpoenas to be withdrawn. He cited concerns about “the continued success of the Northern Ireland peace process.” Moloney and McIntyre fought the issue on appeal, eventually receiving a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court. But the Court declined to hear the case, and in September, 2013, Boston College turned eleven interviews over to authorities in Belfast.","1478","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Last April, Adams reported to a police station in Antrim and was arrested for questioning in connection with the death of McConville. After surrendering his belt, tie, comb, and watch, he was interrogated for four days. He proclaimed his innocence, blaming a “malicious, untruthful, and sinister campaign” against him. He also raised a concern about the timing of his arrest: Sinn Fein was involved in simultaneous campaigns for seats in the European Union and in local government elections. “Both Moloney and McIntyre are opponents of the Sinn Fein leadership and our strategy,” Adams said at a press conference after his release. He has characterized the Belfast Project as “an entirely bogus, shoddy, and self-serving effort.”","1479","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"At the press conference, Adams said that “the I.R.A. is gone—it’s finished.” But, during a Sinn Fein rally to protest his arrest, Bobby Storey—a close friend of his and a longtime Party operative with a thuggish reputation—alleged that there were sinister motives behind the investigation. Midway through the speech, Storey declared, “We haven’t gone away, you know.” During my time in Belfast, half a dozen people quoted that line to me, noting the presumably deliberate echo of Adams’s famous 1995 quote about the I.R.A. Storey “didn’t mean Sinn Fein hadn’t gone away,” McIntyre said. “He meant the I.R.A.” To Michael McConville, the message was clear: even after peace and decommissioning, the I.R.A. would brook no challenge to its leader. “It still rules by threats,” he said.","1480","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"By the time Adams was arrested, Dolours Price was dead. One day in January of 2013, one of her sons came home and discovered her in bed. “She wasn’t breathing,” he later told an inquest. Price had been drinking for several days, and had briefly been admitted to the hospital after falling down a flight of stairs. A medical examination found that she had died of a toxic combination of sedatives and antidepressants. Suicide was ruled out, but, when I asked Anthony and Carrie McIntyre if Price killed herself, Carrie said, “I believe it.”","1481","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"

"In Hughes’s oral history, he spoke to McIntyre about having been a hunger striker in prison. “The body is a fantastic machine,” he said. “It’ll eat off all the fat tissue first, and then it’ll eat the muscle, to keep your brain alive.” Long after Hughes and Price called an end to their strikes and attempted to reintegrate into society, they nursed old grudges and endlessly replayed their worst wartime abominations. They never stopped devouring themselves. In the coroner’s report for Dolours Price, the official pronouncement was “death by misadventure.”","1484","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The police did not charge Adams in the murder of McConville, and the investigation did not set back Sinn Fein: the Party did surprisingly well in the 2014 elections, winning more seats than expected. Today, it is the most popular political party in Ireland. According to polls, half the voters in Sinn Fein do not believe Adams’s claims about never having been a member of the I.R.A., but they do not appear to care. The beach where Jean McConville’s body was found is in Louth, Adams’s constituency in the Republic, yet Adams seems likely to retain the seat for as long as he wants it. In most countries, merely being implicated in a murder would be enough to derail a political career. But Adams has a knack for weathering scandals. During a trial in 2013, it was revealed that his brother Liam was a pedophile who had molested his own daughter, and that Adams had known but done little to intervene; last October, a woman named Maria Cahill alleged that she had been raped, as a teen-ager, by an I.R.A. man, and that Adams had failed to discipline the rapist. “I don’t know what the Irish word for Teflon is,” Richard Haass told me. “But he has it.”","1485","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In November, Adams flew to New York to give a speech to American supporters. In a vast hotel ballroom, the crowd whooped as he walked to the lectern. Adams has gleaming, outsized teeth, and I could make them out clearly from the back of the room. Standing in front of a banner bearing the words “United Ireland,” Adams spoke about the importance of American allies in ending “a very long war.” His voice is stentorian, and he speaks with schoolmasterly authority; he has the calm aura befitting a global celebrity who flies around the world advising armed factions and heads of state about how to make ceasefires stick.","1486","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Then, just as Adams was reminiscing about his first visit to the White House, in 1994, the brute in him came out. Speaking of the Irish Independent, which had been publishing critical stories about him, he observed that the paper had also been tough on Michael Collins, the Republican hero of 1916. And how did Collins deal with this affront? “He sent volunteers into their offices, held the editor at gunpoint, and destroyed the entire printing press.” The room, full of Irish-Americans, erupted in applause. Adams leaned into the microphone and murmured, “I’m obviously not advocating that,” prompting raucous, knowing laughter.","1487","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Michael McConville does not believe that Adams or anyone else will be brought to account for the murder of his mother. “We’re all adults here—we all know the score,” he told me. Several other people have been arrested for questioning in the case, but only one, Ivor Bell, has been charged. (Bell denies any involvement in McConville’s disappearance.) Bell reportedly gave an interview to the Boston College project, and if the case goes to trial prosecutors may use his recorded recollections—which he had offered for posterity, thinking that they would be sealed until after his death—against him. Bell’s lawyer, Kevin Winters, assured me that Bell “will fight the charges,” and it seems unlikely that the truth about McConville’s death will come out in any such proceeding. The physical evidence in the case is diffuse and decades old, so it would be difficult to sustain a conviction against any of the perpetrators. Because Dolours Price and Brendan Hughes are dead, they cannot testify against Adams; in legal terms, their interviews and oral histories amount to hearsay. Adams and his supporters have also gone to great lengths to attack the credibility of Price and Hughes. “Brendan was a friend of mine,” Adams told the Guardian, in 2011. “But Brendan had his issues and his difficulties. He was opposed to the peace process. He was politically hostile to what we were trying to do. Brendan said what Brendan said, and Brendan’s dead. So let it go.”","1488","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Adams is not wrong about the bitter resentment of his former comrades. Price once described her willingness to identify Adams as a former I.R.A. member as an effort to “settle scores.” Nevertheless, it’s hard to explain away the very specific, and similar, recollections that Hughes and Price shared about Jean McConville’s murder. When the journalist Darragh MacIntyre pressed Adams about McConville in a 2013 BBC documentary, “The Disappeared,” Adams, looking like a cornered animal, flashed a hostile grin and noted that Hughes and Price had “demons.” He added, vaguely, “All of us bear a responsibility, those of us who are in the leadership. I’ve never shirked that.”","1489","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Adams declined repeated requests to speak with me for this article, citing, through a representative, the “flawed” nature of the Boston College interviews, which focussed on testimony by “former Republicans who have accused Sinn Fein of betrayal.” He seems to have said his piece on the matter, and if no criminal charges are filed he may never be obliged to say anything further. (Adams continues to be forthcoming on other subjects. Last month, he informed an interviewer on Irish radio that he enjoys jumping on a trampoline. “I do it naked,” he said, adding that he is sometimes accompanied in this regimen by his dog.)","1490","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"The question of whether or not Jean McConville was an informer will also likely remain unresolved. Michael McConville and his siblings are adamant that Brendan Hughes was mistaken about a transmitter being in the flat, and they doubt his claim that McConville confessed to being an informer. Helen once said, “If they were torturing her, she would have admitted to anything. What mother wouldn’t?”","1491","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Family members point to the O’Loan report, but the report says only that no official records were found to indicate that Jean McConville was an informer. If she was a low-level informer, such records might not exist. Moloney and McIntyre, who share an unshakable confidence in the credibility of Brendan Hughes, believe that the British government may also have suppressed the paper trail on McConville in order to conceal the fact that the Army allowed one of its confidential sources to be executed. In any case, the I.R.A. clearly believed that McConville was a tout, though that is no justification for what befell her. When McIntyre asked Brendan Hughes whether he regretted executing McConville, Hughes said that he had supported the decision at the time. “But not now,” he continued. “Because, as everything turned out, not one death was worth it.”","1492","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"Ed Moloney observes that Adams’s cold-blooded detachment, which so maddened Price and Hughes, may have allowed him to imagine what they could not—a future beyond the armed struggle—and to create peace. Adams has many unkind things to say about Moloney, but Moloney believes that Adams should have won the Nobel Peace Prize. “Gerry’s a very hollow man,” Brendan Hughes’s brother Terry said, before adding, “But then maybe that’s politics.”","1493","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"In the long run, the war may be won by demography. Sinn Fein has predicted that a Catholic majority will eventually preside in Northern Ireland, and the percentage of Catholics has increased in recent decades. But this doesn’t mean that the British will soon be voted off the island. After the 2008 fiscal crisis and the subsequent recession in Dublin, some polls found that most Catholics in the north prefer to remain part of the United Kingdom. “Outbreeding Unionists may be an enjoyable pastime for those who have the energy,” Adams has said. “But it hardly amounts to a political strategy.”","1494","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"For a small minority, the armed struggle never ended. I visited Belfast just before Christmas, and three different splinter factions of the I.R.A. were promising attacks in the city over the holiday. I had wanted to speak with Marian Price, but she was prevented by legal troubles: in 2013, she confessed to having provided a mobile phone that a Republican splinter group used to take responsibility for a shooting at an Army barracks; two British solders were killed in the attack. (Her sentence was recently suspended, but the terms of her release prohibit her from talking to journalists.) “It’s not over,” Anthony McIntyre told me. “It’s still a very dangerous society.”","1495","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried"
"According to Michael McConville, the police in Northern Ireland have asked him to name the men and women who took his mother away and supply testimony to help convict them. He has refused, he told me, partly out of fear that his wife and children might become victims of reprisal. (He also refused to tell me any of the kidnappers’ names.) Several years ago, he had briefly considered identifying the perpetrators, but he says that when he told Adams of his intentions Adams replied, “I hope you are ready for the backlash.” (Adams has denied saying this.) The authorities offered to give Michael a new identity, and to move him and his family out of the country.

Michael opened one of the doors to reveal a wall lined with little cubbyholes, in which dozens of pigeons warbled and bobbed and shifted their feet. He keeps hundreds of pigeons now, and he races them competitively. “Through the whole Troubles, there was never any hassle between Protestants and Catholics raising pigeons,” he said, delicately cupping one of the birds in his hand.

"Hillary Clinton’s big speech about the economy on Monday generated a wide range of reactions from the punditocracy. The Times’s David Brooks thought it was politically clever: “She’s cleared the first political hurdle of the campaign,” he wrote. Vox’s Matthew Yglesias said that Clinton’s policy agenda amounted to a rebuke of neoliberalism and indicated a “paleoliberal revival.” Politico’s Ben White reckoned that the speech was a non-event. “The snap reaction among Wall Street investors, economists and ardent financial reformers who thrill to the soak-the-rich rhetoric of Bernie Sanders was a collective: ‘Meh.

"My reaction was that the speech suggested serious intentions to tackle the problem of wage stagnation and to boost middle-class incomes (“That will be my mission from the first day I’m President to the last,” Clinton said), while still seeking to hold the center ground of today’s Democratic Party, which has shifted to the left since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in 2008, and the later rise of Occupy Wall Street. Compared to the starry-eyed supply-side revivalism of Jeb Bush and the relentless labor-bashing of Scott Walker, though, her speech was on a different plane completely.","1503","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"In terms of policy details, it was pretty much as expected. Many of the proposals that Clinton outlined were part of a lengthy report on “inclusive prosperity” that was published, earlier this year, by the Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta, her campaign manager. The C.A.P.’s panel of experts, led by Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, and Ed Balls, the Labour Party’s top spokesman on economic issues, proposed boosting the minimum wage, investing in child care and education, setting up an infrastructure bank, changing the tax code to eliminate loopholes enjoyed by the rich, expanding tax breaks for profit-sharing and employee share ownership, and strengthening collective bargaining.","1504","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clinton proposed all of these things. She also embraced President Obama’s recent move to expand overtime pay, called for more paid sick days and family leave, and promised to prosecute individuals and firms on Wall Street. (On my Twitter stream, that last pledge sparked some skepticism. One person sent me a link to an OpenSecrets.org page showing that three of Clinton’s top four campaign donors, in the course of her career, are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase.)","1505","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"One thing Clinton didn’t do was utter the “R-word”—redistribution—which would surely be a central element of any serious revival of old-fashioned American liberalism. Instead, she talked about encouraging “fair growth,” which is another term for inclusive prosperity. Speaking on this theme, she said, for example, “We have to get serious about supporting workers,” and, referring to the need for tax reform, “Those at the top have to pay their fair share.”","1506","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clinton didn’t spell out how she’d revive labor unions, which now represent less than seven per cent of workers in the private sector. The only specific tax changes she proposed that would affect the very rich were eliminating the carried-interest deduction enjoyed by hedge-fund managers and private-equity managers, and enacting the “Buffett rule,” which would apply a minimum federal tax rate of thirty per cent to people earning more than a million dollars a year. These are two eminently worthwhile proposals, ones that President Obama has also endorsed. By themselves, however, they wouldn’t do very much to address the remarkable concentration of income and wealth at the very top of the income distribution.","1507","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"To be fair to Clinton, nobody is quite sure how to tackle that problem. At the very least, it would require a three-pronged approach: far-reaching changes to the tax code aimed at taxing wealth and restoring the progressivity that was part of the code until Ronald Reagan came to power; reining in the financial sector, which is responsible for much of the rise in inequality over the past thirty years; and challenging the social norms and corporate-governance structures that facilitate the outlandish pay packages received by senior corporate executives.","1508","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"
"Clearly, Clinton isn’t willing to go that far, although she did say that she’d get back to us with some proposals to encourage long-term investing over short-term trading. “The speech revealed a woman who does not have her heart in class conflict,” Brooks rightly noted. Like many centrist Democrats, she prefers to talk about expanding opportunity while proposing individual measures with a redistributive aspect, such as providing child care for working mothers and expanding financial aid for students from modest backgrounds. Over the past twenty-five years, this pragmatic approach has produced some major advances for Americans of modest means, such as the repeated expansion of earned-income-tax credits and the Affordable Care Act.","1509","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say"

Their message was a positive one. “The view inside the campaign is that voters are concerned about kitchen-table issues Clinton wants to talk about, rather than media reports and Republican attacks on the [Clinton] foundation, the officials said,” Vox’s Jonathan Allen reported. “There’s no conflict between her promise to represent ‘everyday Americans’ and the access big donors have had to Clinton and her husband over the years, they said, arguing that voters will trust her to represent them in the White House.”","May 29, 2015","1523","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"That was partly spin, of course. There is no end in sight to the stories about the finances of the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton e-mails, or the activities of some of the Clintons’ associates. But as spring rolls into summer, Team Brooklyn has successfully accomplished its two initial goals: heading off the possibility of a serious challenge for the Democratic nomination and surviving a barrage of negative publicity that was inevitable at some stage, and which was, therefore, best confronted early on.","1524","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The entry into the Democratic contest by Bernie Sanders was welcome from a Clintonite perspective, because it filled a potentially dangerous vacuum. With his long record of service to progressive causes, Sanders is popular enough to garner a decent-sized following among liberal Democrats, but he’s almost certainly too far to the left to represent a serious threat to Hillary. So far, at least, his presence has been more of a problem for Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who is set to officially announce his candidacy on Saturday. As I noted back in March, O’Malley is a serious figure who demands some respect. As governor, he eliminated the death penalty, legalized gay marriage, and championed various good-government initiatives. But with Sanders already out there on the stump, O’Malley has struggled to gain traction.","1525","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"A new poll of likely Democratic voters conducted by Quinnipiac University illustrates the scale of the task that is facing Clinton’s challengers. The survey, which was carried out from May 19th to May 26th, showed her getting fifty-seven per cent of the vote. Sanders was in second place, with fifteen per cent. O’Malley got just one per cent, and so did two other possible candidates, Jim Webb, a former U.S. senator from Virginia, and Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and U.S. senator from Rhode Island. Of course, it is early in the process, and anything could happen between now and the end of the primaries. At this stage, though, Clinton is sitting pretty.","1526","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"Something similar, if somewhat less definitive, could be said of her position vis-à-vis her potential Republican opponents. Opinion polls positing head-to-head matchups with likely G.O.P. candidates have consistently shown Clinton winning, and the Quinnipiac survey was no exception. It showed her with double-digit leads over Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, two of the Republican front-runners. Interestingly, the closest hypothetical contests were with Rand Paul, the libertarian senator from Kentucky, and Florida senator Marco Rubio, whom some in the Clinton camp have reportedly identified as her biggest potential threat. Clinton’s leads over both Paul and Rubio were four points.","1527","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The Quinnipiac poll also contained some valuable clues as to how Clinton has been able, so far, to navigate all of the negative media coverage she has received while sustaining relatively little damage to her overall polling numbers. In terms of the level of personal trust that voters have in Clinton, the drip-drip-drip of stories does seem to be having an effect. Fifty-three per cent of respondents to the Quinnipiac survey said that they do not consider her to be “honest and trustworthy,” while only thirty-nine per cent said that they did. Among self-identified Independents, the numbers were even more lopsided: sixty-one per cent to thirty-one per cent.","1528","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"The number of people who question Clinton’s trustworthiness must be of concern to her team, and it’s a figure that Republican ad-makers and opposition-research shops will be seeking to increase. But this issue needs to be weighed against the fact that Presidential elections are about leadership—and most Americans think of Clinton as an experienced and strong leader. One of the survey questions asked, “Would you say that Hillary Clinton has strong leadership qualities or not?” Sixty per cent of respondents said yes, and thirty-seven per cent said no. Among Independents, fifty-eight per cent answered yes, and thirty-eight per cent said no.","1529","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/at-this-early-stage-hillary-clinton-looks-strong"
"These findings suggest that voters are more sophisticated than they are sometimes given credit for. Rather than looking at politicians in black-and-white terms, they are able to size up candidates’ strengths and weaknesses, and to reach an over-all view based on what they are looking for in a leader. At a time when the world seems like an increasingly dangerous place and a majority of Americans believe that the country is on the wrong track, perceived strength and decisiveness may well count for a great deal. “Can you get low marks on honesty and still be a strong leader?” said Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, in a news release. “Sure you can.

With his changing answers to the question that Megyn Kelly first posed to him, last Monday on Fox News, about whether he would have ordered an invasion in 2003 knowing what he knows now, the former Florida governor has provided campaign reporters with something juicy to write about, and Republican fretters with something to fret about.","May 19, 2015","1532","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"If Dubya’s younger brother can’t avoid friendly fire in the confines of a Fox News interview, how will he handle it when the campaign proper begins?* The benign explanation is that he’s ring-rusty—thirteen years since his last election, and all that. But, on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, darker suspicions are lurking. Perhaps Bush isn’t up to speed on international issues, or, worse, he’s too tied to his younger sibling to give the obvious answer to Kelly’s question: “No, no, no—a thousand times, no.”","1533","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"In Democratic circles, the sight of Bush floundering was a welcome one. Barely had he emerged from the Fox interview when the Democratic National Committee put out a video, entitled “Don’t Get Fooled Again,” which intersperses his comments to Kelly with some footage from 2002 of George W. saying “Fool me once, shame on me. … You can’t get fooled again.” The jabs keep coming. In Monday’s Times, Paul Krugman, one of the few commentators in the mainstream press who expressed skepticism in the run-up to the March, 2003 invasion, took the opportunity to get in another dig at George W. Bush, Don Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, et al, reminding his readers, “We were lied into war.”","1534","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Since 2007 or thereabouts, opinion polls have consistently showed that a sizable majority of Americans regard the Iraq invasion as a mistake. If the Democrats were likely to field a candidate in 2016 who opposed the war all along, they’d be in a position to exploit the issue for all it’s worth, just as Barack Obama did in 2008. But, unless something unexpected happens, the Democratic nominee will be Hillary Clinton, who, in October, 2002, voted for a congressional resolution that authorized the use of force against Iraq, and whose current take on the decision to go to war isn’t terribly easy to distinguish from the one that Jeb Bush has stumbled into.","1535","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Bush’s position, as he explained it in his second clarification last week, is the following: “ ‘Knowing what we know now, what would you have done?’ I would’ve not engaged; I would not have gone into Iraq. That’s not to say that the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is gone—it is significantly safer. That’s not to say that there was a courageous effort to bring about a surge that created stability in Iraq—all of that is true. … But we’ve answered the question now.”","1536","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Clinton’s public statements, like Bush’s, have gone through several iterations. In September, 2007, she argued that she hadn’t, in fact, voted for a preëmptive war, and said, “Obviously, if I had known then what I know now about what the President would do with the authority that was given him, I would not have voted the way that I did.” Since many people regarded the resolution, at the time it passed, in October, 2002, as a blank check (twenty-one Democratic senators voted against it), this explanation didn’t do Clinton much good, but she stuck with it throughout her 2008 Presidential campaign, refusing to describe her vote as a mistake. In her 2014 memoir, “Hard Choices,” Clinton changed tack, fessing up and saying that she had relied heavily on prewar intelligence about Saddam’s programs to build weapons of mass destruction. “I should have stated my regret sooner and in the plainest, most direct language possible,” she wrote. She went on, “I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.”","1537","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"That language was commendably clear. It means that Clinton and Bush are now agreed upon the proposition that, knowing what we know now, invading Iraq was an error. The two of them also agree that, once Saddam had been overthrown, the U.S.-led occupation bungled things by not providing adequate security inside Iraq. In her book, Clinton wrote that the United States “went to war in Iraq with only half a strategy.” In his interview with Kelly, Bush said, “Once we invaded and took out Saddam Hussein, we didn’t focus on security first, and the Iraqis in this incredibly insecure environment turned on the United States military because there was no security for themselves and their families. By the way, guess who thinks that those mistakes took place as well? George W. Bush.”","1538","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"It was pretty rich of Jeb to cite his brother’s post-White House ruminations in an effort to exculpate the tragic errors of the Bush Administration. Nonetheless, Jeb’s statements to Kelly, in which he also included a direct reference to Clinton’s 2002 vote, highlighted the dilemma facing the Democratic front-runner. If she tries to use the Iraq issue against the Republicans, by, for example, warning that a G.O.P. President could end up blundering into another war, she will open herself to criticisms, counterattacks, and endless rehashings of her 2002 vote.","1539","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Is there a way around this problem? I think that perhaps there is. Rather than apologizing and complaining about faulty intelligence, Clinton could say that we all make mistakes, but the key thing is what we learn from them. In the case of the Republicans in general, and Jeb Bush in particular, she could argue convincingly that the learning process has hardly begun.","1540","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Despite Bush’s claim, during the big foreign-policy speech that he delivered in Chicago in February, that “I’m my own man,” it has been widely reported that he’s been consulting with some of his brother’s former advisers, including Paul Wolfowitz, who famously said that the Iraqis would “welcome us as liberators.” The speech itself relied on standard G.O.P. boilerplate—“Weakness invites war. Strength encourages peace”—and was devoid of novel ideas. Setting aside Rand Paul, who has virtually no chance of winning the nomination, there is precious little evidence of new thinking elsewhere in the Republican field, either. Indeed, Marco Rubio’s speech last week at the Council on Foreign Relations suggests that the candidates are trying to outdo each other in bellicosity.","1541","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"Clinton, for her part, still has work to do to explain what she learned from the Iraq disaster. Clearly, it didn’t turn her against the concept of overseas military intervention. In 2011, as Secretary of State, she helped orchestrate air attacks on Libya that aided in bringing down Muammar Qaddafi, unleashing a civil war that is still raging. In 2013, after she left office, she supported U.S. military action against the Syrian regime, a course that President Obama eventually backed away from. In “Hard Choices,” however, she struck a cautious note. “As much as I have wanted to, I could never change my vote on Iraq,” she wrote. “But I could try to help us learn the right lessons from that war … I was determined to do exactly that when facing future hard choices, with more experience, wisdom, skepticism, and humility.”","1542","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"As the 2016 campaign unfolds, Clinton might want to say more about how her views have changed, and how, as President, she would reconcile her urge to exercise American power—both to protect U.S. interests and to do some good in the world—with the harsh realities of experience. Such a discussion would help shift attention away from her 2002 vote and allow her to draw a contrast with the Republicans’ empty rhetoric. More importantly, it would focus the campaign debate on the question that, ever since March, 2003, has been hovering over practically everything: Whither America after Iraq?","1543","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"
"In his measured responses to international crises and his occasional flip-flops, President Obama has provided one answer, which harkens back to the cautious realism of the former national-security advisers Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft. Would Clinton stick to Obama’s “Don’t do stupid stuff” philosophy? Based on her history, some analysts suspect that she remains, at heart, a neo-liberal interventionist, à la Tony Blair, or even, perhaps, an old-school Democratic hawk from the Scoop Jackson school. Understandably enough, given the controversy that followed critical remarks that she made last summer about the U.S.’s cautious policy in Syria, Clinton hasn’t said much during the past nine months that would help voters place her on the foreign-policy spectrum. Now that she’s officially a candidate for President, it’s time she helped them out a little.","1544","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-iraq-dilemma"

"Hillary Clinton, in her memoir “Living History,” recounts her struggle to defend her privacy while residing in the White House. Some of her stories have a gothic tone. After Bill Clinton’s first inauguration, Harry and Linda Thomason, friends from Hollywood, found a jocular note under a pillow in the Lincoln Bedroom. It was from Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host. How did the note get there? “I don’t believe in ghosts, but we did sometimes feel that the White House was haunted by more temporal entities,” Clinton writes.","1546","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"A few months later, as she grieved over the death of her father, she noticed that furniture in the living quarters had been disturbed. She discovered that security officers had searched for bugging devices, without consulting her. “I suddenly remembered the Rush Limbaugh note,” she writes. “I was undone by the invasion of privacy. Yes, we were living in a house that belongs to our nation. But there’s an understanding that individuals who occupy it are allowed some rooms of their own.”","1547","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"That sensibility partly explains this summer’s Clinton non-scandal or mini-scandal or proto-scandal, as it may be. The matter arose from a decision by Clinton when she was the Secretary of State to eschew the government’s e-mail system for a private one. In this hot summer of Donald Trump’s smash reality show and excited crowds for Clinton’s Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders, the e-mail imbroglio is giving her supporters indigestion. The headlines recall the bewildering, partisan-inflamed, and largely inconsequential controversies that surfaced during her husband’s Presidency—Whitewater, Travelgate, the Paula Jones case, the Monica Lewinsky matter, and, finally, President Clinton’s impeachment hearings. It was an era in Washington about which only white-collar defense lawyers may feel nostalgic.","1548","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Now the Clintons again confront a scrum of Republican congressmen and conservative activists who are clearly out to get them. Yet the tenacity of Republican opposition researchers does not by itself explain why Clinton and her husband are so often beset by accusation. Both of them too often co-author their dramas by obfuscating and tolerating conflicts of interest, such as when, between 2009 and 2013, with Hillary Clinton guiding American foreign policy, the Clinton Foundation accepted large donations from foreign governments, including several that abuse human rights.","1549","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"The e-mail case is, so far, a more ambiguous tangle. In late 2008 or early 2009, the incoming Secretary installed a private server at her New York home. She has said that she wanted to avoid carrying multiple e-mail devices, something that using the State Department system might have required. “What was supposed to be convenient has turned out to be anything but convenient,” Clinton remarked last week. Late last year, Clinton turned over to the State Department about thirty thousand e-mails from her home system. But, before doing so, she and her attorneys singled out more than thirty thousand other e-mails, which they deemed to be “private,” and, as far as is known, deleted them permanently. Clinton has said that the deleted notes concerned only “yoga routines, family vacations,” and the like. Her unilateral culling raised eyebrows, but her lawyers approved her action, and her assertion of privacy rights seems to have resonated with Democratic voters.","1550","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Now, however, the F.B.I. is involved. This is because an inspector general for U.S. intelligence agencies, and another for the State Department, reviewed a sample of Clinton’s e-mails and identified classified information in some of them. By near-automatic protocol, that finding was referred to the Justice Department. One of the F.B.I.’s tasks in the weeks ahead will be to look into whether, amid all the e-mailing to and from Secretary Clinton, any crime may have been committed, by anyone. There is no indication that Clinton is the target of a criminal inquiry.","1551","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"Unfortunately for the candidate, though, the law around handling classified information can resemble a house of mirrors. The federal government routinely classifies many more documents than it needs to, including ones containing publicly known or harmless information. Consequently, government employees must treat subjects widely covered in the media, such as the fact that the U.S. carries out lethal drone strikes, as if they were super-secret. And even the most innocuous discussions with foreign government officials may be judged classified. This is often silly, yet the F.B.I. goes by the book. If Clinton and her aides swapped classified information over an unsecured e-mail system, they could be questioned about mishandling state secrets.","1552","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"That misdemeanor has ensnared several high office-holders in the recent past. In 2001, John Deutch, President Clinton’s second C.I.A. director, admitted to a single count of mishandling classified material, because he kept top-secret files at home on a Macintosh connected to the open Internet. (Bill Clinton pardoned him.) In 2005, Samuel Berger, a former Clinton Administration national-security adviser, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, because, after leaving office—for reasons that remain unclear—he removed classified documents from the National Archives and destroyed them. Earlier this year, General David Petraeus pleaded to a misdemeanor after allowing his mistress and biographer to read sensitive notebooks that he kept when he ran the C.I.A.","1553","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"
"In each of those cases, the evidence of serious or willful neglect was much clearer than anything that has emerged about Hillary Clinton’s e-mailing. It has not yet been independently determined whether any of the classified information in her correspondence was marked as such, for example, or how sensitive the secrets discussed might have been. Still, it is conceivable that more striking evidence of deception or serious neglect may eventually surface, and, in any event, the investigations will go on—and on and on, if past inquiries of this type are any guide.","1554","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/comment-hillary-clintons-e-mail-tangle"

News cycles about faltering front-runners are as much a ritual of early primary seasons as eating pork on a stick at the Iowa State Fair. Hillary Clinton’s campaign is only starting.

Both are drawn to reformist spiritual and political ideas. But in “Resurrection” the main character, Dmitri Nekhlyudov, another landowning aristocrat, goes a step further, into what appears to be full-bore rejection of his world and its values. He institutes land reform on his estates, and leaves the Russia of cities and country homes to undertake a long eastward journey to Siberia, where a household servant he seduced and abandoned years earlier has been unjustly imprisoned. Where “War and Peace” and “Anna Karenina” presented the life of a corrupt society with astonishing richness and subtlety, “Resurrection” is relentlessly preachy, prudish, and joyless.","1557","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clintons-resurrection"
"There is a strain of American liberalism that offers government as a sensible, useful way to make society function better than it does now—as a problem-solving instrument that conservatives are too stubbornly prejudiced to employ. That is Bill Clinton’s liberalism. And then there’s the Tolstoyan strain, in which it’s evident that society works well only for a fortunate minority, whose elaborately enjoyed well-being may even have come at the expense of the majority. Tolstoyan liberalism is, like its namesake, élite liberalism—more Franklin Roosevelt (who grew up on an American inherited dacha farmed by peasants) than Eugene Debs, or for that matter Elizabeth Warren. Tolstoy offers a harsh critique, but from an insider’s perspective; it treats the system as deeply flawed, but not as utterly alien.

"This week’s speech left the answers to such questions where they usually are with Clinton—tantalizingly uncertain. She left all but a few specifics of her economic policies to be unveiled in speeches to come, and she made sure to praise small business, entrepreneurship, and investment. But she criticized Wall Street by name and by specific practices (her Web site has a section called “Rein in Wall Street”), and criticized Uber and AirbnB, sacred causes in Silicon Valley, without naming them, by saying that their advent is “raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future.” This demonstrates a willingness to risk alienating the subcultures where some of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors dwell. (On Friday, President Obama will appear at a fund-raiser at the San Francisco home of Shervin Pishevar, one of Uber’s founding investors.)

"It felt as if Clinton were crossing a line, policy specifics or no, in the way she was choosing to frame economic questions. First, she made it clear that the traditionally safe zone for American political discourse about the economy—calling for equality of opportunity, not equality of result—was no longer sufficient for her. Her target is “strong and steady income growth” for ordinary working people, which can presumably be measured only by how much money people wind up with, not how fair a chance they had to make it. And second, she at least toyed with the theme of resentment of the rich—another area Democratic politicians of the past generation, including Clinton herself, have generally avoided—as when she responded to Jeb Bush’s exhortation to Americans to work longer hours by saying, “Let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast-food workers marching in the streets for better pay.

"Tolstoy, even though he was deep into his final holy-moralist phrase, didn’t quite know what to do with Nekhlyudov at the end of “Resurrection.” Having set out on his Siberian journey resolved to give everything away and to marry his wronged former mistress, the hero is perhaps relieved to learn that she refuses to marry him. He’s free, and it seems possible that he might return to some version of the former life he had been determined to reject.

She won’t, and can’t, run, or live, as a radical. So it’s a question of finding the right equipoise. The practice of American politics almost always requires rhetorical optimism; the practice of liberal American politics now seems also to require just the right measure of opprobrium directed at the way our country is run. What’s interesting about Clinton’s struggle to find the balance is that she is struggling to find it, as she hasn’t in the past.

But, as Ronald Reagan’s handlers discovered many years ago, the problem with giving journalists the slip, which Clinton has been doing with evident enthusiasm in the early weeks of her Democratic primary campaign, is that eventually this avoidance strategy becomes the story. So, just as Michael Deaver, Larry Speakes, et al. prevailed on the Gipper to do the occasional press conference in an effort to keep the jackals at bay, Clinton’s communications advisers evidently persuaded her to sit down with CNN’s Brianna Keilar for an interview that was advertised as the first of many media interactions to come.","1566","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"If the Clinton campaign thought that she would be treated more softly by Keilar than by one of the network’s more well-known names—Wolf Blitzer or Jake Tapper, say—it was disappointed. Keilar peppered Clinton with questions about the private e-mail server she used as Secretary of State, polls showing that many American distrust her, and the big crowds that her opponent Bernie Sanders is attracting. Then, when Tapper asked Keilar about the interview, Keilar criticized the answers Clinton gave her, saying, “I did not hear a more open or transparent Hillary Clinton.”","1567","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Keilar’s raspberry wasn’t the only one blown in Clinton’s direction. She “looked and sounded cagey and defensive, when her apparent goal is to inspire,” Lloyd Grove, an editor-at-large for the Daily Beast, wrote, adding, “The candidate was, by turns, self-justifying and pugnacious, and occasionally just plain inauthentic.”","1568","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Clinton certainly didn’t sound very convincing at times, especially when she sought to blame Republicans for whipping up concerns about her deleted e-mails and other matters. Given that she didn’t have anything new to announce, it was perhaps surprising that the campaign chose to put her out there now. Why not wait until next week, when she is due to give a speech laying out some economic proposals? As Clinton showed when she steered a question from Keilar about Donald Trump toward the Republican Party’s position on immigration, she’s much more comfortable and persuasive when talking about policy issues.","1569","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"On the positive side, Clinton avoided making any major gaffes, which was probably her primary goal. In today’s always-on media climate, attacks and mistakes dominate the news cycle, and all campaigns know this. If a campaign can supply the former and avoid the latter, it is doing fine. Failure to abide by this maxim leads into Trump territory, where his obnoxious remarks about Mexicans are currently doing serious damage to his business empire. (David Remnick has more on Trump’s campaign.)","1570","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"In any case, forging a working relationship with the national media is just one of two immediate challenges facing Clinton. The other—what to do about the rise of Bernie Sanders—is far more important. Earlier this week, in a front-page piece in the Times, the Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, who ran Howard Dean’s 2004 Presidential campaign, was quoted as saying about Clinton, “Certainly she could lose Iowa.”","1571","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Even if this happened, Trippi added, Clinton would probably go on to win the nomination. That’s true. But just a few weeks ago, the very idea of Sanders winning the Iowa primary would have seemed far-fetched. Now, perceptions are changing. In an interview with Politico (for a piece headlined “The socialist surge”), Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor, compared Sanders to Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern, two liberals who, in 1968 and 1972, picked up a lot of support in the early primary states and derailed establishment favorites.","1572","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"It’s far too early to mention Hillary Clinton in the same breath as Lyndon B. Johnson or Ed Muskie, but how she chooses to deal with the Sanders phenomenon will have a greater impact on public opinion than whether she gives regular media interviews. So far, she has largely adopted a watching brief. A Clinton adviser admitted to the Times that the campaign had underestimated Sanders’ appeal in Iowa, but added, “It’s too early to change strategy because no one knows if Sanders will be able to hold on to these voters in the months ahead.”","1573","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Most likely, he will hold on to a good number of them.","1574","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"There are two reasons Sanders is doing so well. Firstly, he’s perceived as an outsider, and he’s tapping into a progressive movement that has little faith in the Democratic Party establishment. Secondly, the primary timetable favors him. On a national basis, according to a recent CNN/O.R.C. poll of likely Democratic voters, Clinton still has a huge lead over Sanders: fifty-seven per cent to fourteen per cent. (In fact, the poll found that Sanders was in third place, behind Vice President Biden, who got sixteen per cent despite not having entered the race.) It so happens, though, that Iowa and New Hampshire both contain many white, college-educated liberals who are sympathetic to the Vermont senator’s views. Sanders is polling less well among other elements of the Democratic coalition, particularly African-Americans and Hispanics, who won’t come out in force until the primary contest moves to states like South Carolina.","1575","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"Clearly, Clinton can’t do anything about the electoral calendar. Can she successfully counter Sanders’s political message in the early primary states? Over the next few weeks, as she starts rolling out her campaign proposals, we should get some indication. After that, she is planning on taking a vacation. The schedule for televised Democratic debates, of which there will be half a dozen, has yet to be set, and voting day in Iowa is still almost seven months away. But the race is now on.","1576","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clintons-two-challenges-the-media-and-bernie-sanders"
"I’m down in Washington, D.C., at the Institute for New Economic Thinking’s Finance & Society conference, at which, as I pointed out yesterday, all of the speakers are women. At the opening dinner last night, Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered a rousing condemnation of the big banks that, to me, at least, sounded suspiciously like a stump speech. “Financial institutions shouldn’t be allowed to cheat people,” she said at one point. “Can I have an amen on that?”","May 6, 2015","1577","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/elizabeth-warrens-challenge-to-hillary-clinton"

"She could. But this wasn’t an Occupy Wall Street reunion. The audience was largely made up of well-heeled Washingtonians in expensive dresses and suits, a good number of whom cheered. Warren, who, as we all know, isn’t running for President, went on to outline a number of proposals for reform that would go beyond the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which was Washington’s response to the 2008 financial crisis. “Let’s get real. Dodd-Frank did not end too-big-to-fail,” she noted, correctly. What was needed was to “end it once and for all.”","1579","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/elizabeth-warrens-challenge-to-hillary-clinton"

"When I say that it sounded like a stump speech, I’m not criticizing. To the contrary. The Massachusetts senator brings an infectious passion and energy to her issues. She is also able to cut to the essence of complicated subjects, and to expand the political debate to include proposals that many other politicians regard as verboten, such as cutting the megabanks down to size, extending the remit of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (which was her baby), and introducing a transactions tax on short-term trades. Some of her ideas may be questionable. For example, quite a few people who sympathize with her over-all approach aren’t convinced that bringing back the Glass-Steagall Act—which separated commercial banks from investment banks, among other things—is the right solution to Wall Street’s excesses. But, in a town that is still largely beholden to financial-industry lobbyists, she is an essential presence.","1581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/elizabeth-warrens-challenge-to-hillary-clinton"
"After listening to Warren speak, I have no reason to doubt that she was being sincere when she said, just over a month ago, that Hillary Clinton deserves a chance to lay out her program. But I’m pretty sure that Warren also meant it when she told my colleague Ryan Lizza that she expects to have an impact on the political debate and the 2016 election. If Clinton doesn’t demonstrate, with some detailed proposals, that she has left behind for good the light-handed approach to financial regulation associated with her husband’s Administration, she can certainly expect Warren to make her displeasure public.","1582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/elizabeth-warrens-challenge-to-hillary-clinton"
"What form would that expression of displeasure take? It’s too early to speculate. (On a mischievous note, I can’t resist pointing out that, as I write this, the lead story on Politico carries the headline “Warren Met Privately With ‘Draft Warren’ Supporters.”) But the onus is on Clinton, once she completes her “listening tour,” to put together an actual policy platform. Does she support the idea of breaking up the likes of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America? Is imposing transaction taxes on high-frequency traders and other short-term speculators a good idea? Should the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have the power to regulate the auto-loan industry? Warren, and many others, are waiting for answers.","1583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/elizabeth-warrens-challenge-to-hillary-clinton"
"Hillary Clinton’s classified-information nightmare is just beginning—as her predecessor in the United States Senate might have warned that it would. As was often the case, Daniel Patrick Moynihan was ahead of all of us.","August 18, 2015","1584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything"
"As the world now knows, Clinton used a private e-mail address and server to conduct official business as Secretary of State. That in itself was certainly unwise and perhaps a violation of State Department policy. The more significant question now, though, is whether Clinton improperly passed national-security information—that is, classified information—over this private, non-secured connection. Her answer to that question has evolved. Clinton first said, “I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e-mail. There is no classified material.” More recently, she said, “I did not send nor did I receive material marked classified.” Clinton’s quasi-official defenders at Media Matters have seized on this distinction as well. They argue that she is in the clear because she never disclosed information that was designated as classified. But information can be classified whether it is marked that way or not. So what, exactly, is classified information?","1585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything"
"As Moynihan explained in his book “Secrecy: The American Experience” and explored during a lifetime in public service, the definition of what constitutes a government secret has never been clear. Classified information is supposed to be defined as material that would damage national security if released. In fact, Moynihan asserted, government bureaucracies use classification rules to protect turf, to avoid embarrassment, to embarrass rivals—in short, for a variety of motives that have little to do with national security. As the senator wrote, “Americans are familiar with the tendency to overregulate in other areas. What is different with secrecy is that the public cannot know the extent or the content of the regulation. Thus, secrecy is the ultimate mode of regulation; the citizen does not even know that he or she is being regulated!”","1586","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything"
"It’s not only the public who cannot know the extent or content of government secrecy. Realistically, government officials can’t know either—and this is Hillary Clinton’s problem. In investigating only a small portion of her e-mails, government investigators have already flagged more than three hundred that are potentially classified. They will surely find more. As Moynihan noted, government bureaucracies have every incentive to over-classify. It’s the risk-averse approach, and there’s no penalty for erring on the side of caution. Besides, over-classification makes their work seem more important.","1587","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything"
"In one case, according to media reports, one of Clinton’s potentially classified e-mail exchanges is nothing more than a discussion of a newspaper story about drones. That such a discussion could be classified underlines the absurdity of the current system. But that is the system that exists, and if and when the agencies determine that she sent or received classified information through her private server, Clinton will be accused of mishandling national-security secrets.","1588","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything"
"The consequences for Clinton, in the midst of a Presidential run, are far more likely to be political than legal. Criminal violations for mishandling classified information all have intent requirements; in other words, in order to be guilty of a crime, there must be evidence that Clinton knew that the information was classified and intentionally disclosed it to an unauthorized person. There is no evidence she did anything like that. This is not now a criminal matter, and there is no realistic possibility it will turn into one. (Clinton’s critics have noted that General David Petraeus pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with the disclosure of classified information to his biographer. But Petraeus acknowledged both that he knew the information was classified and that his biographer was not cleared to receive it. Because Clinton has said that she did not believe the information was classified, and because she turned it over only to cleared State Department employees, the comparison is inapt.)","1589","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything"
"Still, the investigative wheels are now turning, and the process is out of Clinton’s control. In most political controversies about documents, the best response for a politician is simply to disclose them in order to diffuse the issue. But that option is not available to Clinton. The relevant agencies are now reviewing the documents in order to determine whether they contain classified information; if they find that to be the case (and they will), Clinton will not have the right to make those documents public; the public will never know whether she was discussing newspaper stories or the identity of covert assets. With many agencies reviewing thousands of documents, this process is guaranteed to take months rather than weeks. Thus, the process—and the attention to the issue—will drag on.","1590","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything"
"Could this issue cripple Clinton’s candidacy? Certainly it’s no help, especially for a candidate who has had trouble earning the trust of voters. Still, it’s hard to imagine that voters will be focussed on this issue six months from now, to say nothing of Election Day, which is more than a year away. But it may not be too much to hope that if Clinton does surmount this controversy and take over in the Oval Office, she will recognize, as Moynihan did, the folly of our system of over-classification and take steps to reform its obvious excesses.","1591","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything"

"Jeb Bush said as much this week, charging that Clinton, as Secretary of State during President Obama’s first term, “stood by” as American forces withdrew from Iraq and the country imploded, thereby clearing the way for the Islamic State. “Where was the Secretary of State, Secretary of State Clinton, in all of this?” mused Bush in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, in Simi Valley, California. “Like the President himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away.”","1593","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"

"Let’s rewind the tape. By 2007, Iraq, under American occupation, had disintegrated into a terrible sectarian war. Sunnis and Shiites were butchering each other with breathtaking ferocity. The Kurds were preparing to secede, and regional players like Iran and Saudi Arabia were driving the combatants to greater depths of savagery. The Americans seemed utterly powerless to stop any of it.","1595","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"
"But, instead of quitting, President George W. Bush—Jeb’s older brother—dispatched even more American forces, in a desperate gamble to stop the bloodbath. Very few people, even among the war’s supporters, imagined that it would work. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, both U.S. senators running for the White House, opposed it. But the “surge,” as the Administration called its counteroffensive, worked. It was helped along by other events, like the turning of the Sunni tribes against Al Qaeda. But, by mid-2008, violence had dropped so dramatically in Baghdad and the Sunni lands outside the capital that parts of country, at least to me, were unrecognizable. The group then known as Al Qaeda in Iraq, which dominated the insurgency, had been decimated.","1596","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"
"What happened next is crucial. In 2008, President Bush concluded an agreement with the Iraqi government to withdraw all American forces by the end of 2011. Later that year, Senator Obama was elected President on the promise of getting America out of Iraq. At the time, Iraq was calm, the American people were exhausted, and most Iraqis wanted the U.S. out, too. In December of 2011, the last American troops departed.","1597","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"

"The argument advanced by Jeb Bush is that Iraq spun out of control because the Obama Administration, of which Hillary Clinton was a senior member, made the crucial decision to pull out all the troops before Iraq was ready. But, again, it was Jeb’s brother who made that call—so, at best, Jeb is faulting Obama for not amending the deal.","1599","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"
"Among those who wanted the Americans to stay in Iraq, the idea was this: that American forces had emerged in Iraq as an honest broker—indeed, the only honest broker—between the country’s main factions. One of the most important roles that American forces played was to restrain Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a militant sectarian Shiite, from running roughshod over his opponents. As long as American troops stuck around, the argument goes, Maliki stayed on his best behavior. When the American troops left, Maliki was free to persecute the country’s Sunni minority, eventually driving it into the arms of the successor to Al Qaeda in Iraq: ISIS. As Michael Barbero, the deputy commander of American forces in Iraq, told me last year, “Everything that has happened there was not just predictable—we predicted it.” (There is a fuller picture of how Iraq imploded in a piece I wrote for The New Yorker.)","1600","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"
"I think this argument is partly, but only partly, correct. It’s true that the Americans often stopped Maliki from acting in a blatantly sectarian way. If some troops had remained after 2011—and not necessarily combat troops—the Americans might have able been to stop Maliki from driving the Sunnis toward ISIS. As Sami Al-Askari, a member of the Iraqi parliament, told me last year, “If you had a few hundred here, not even a few thousand, they would be coöperating with you, and they would become your partners. But, when they left, all of them left. There’s no one to talk to about anything.”","1601","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"
"The Obama Administration’s supporters counter that the Iraqi government would not agree to the conditions necessary for American forces to remain in the country after 2011—that the decision was Maliki’s, not Obama’s. But Obama’s fault, according to both American and Iraqi officials who were involved in the negotiations, was that he didn’t try very hard to close the deal. They believed that an agreement might have been possible but for the apathy that was emanating from the White House. The talks ultimately fell apart over the question of immunity for American troops from Iraqi law. The Americans insisted on it, and Maliki was not prepared to ask the Iraqi parliament to approve it. Maliki did offer to sign an executive agreement guaranteeing American immunity, but the White House rejected it. (The Obama White House ended up accepting just such an agreement last year, when it sent American forces back to Iraq.) American diplomats and generals who were trying to make a deal with Maliki told me that they got almost no guidance from the President until the last possible moment. It wasn’t surprising that the deal fell apart.","1602","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"
"Where does this leave Hillary Clinton? By all accounts, she was one of the people inside the Administration who advocated for keeping a residual force in Iraq. “Hillary very much wanted to keep troops in the country,” James Jeffrey, the American Ambassador to Iraq at the time, told me. This does not amount, in Jeb’s words, to “standing by” while Iraq burned.","1603","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"
"Moreover, I think the Republican argument that a handful of American troops could have saved Iraq misses a larger point. The fundamental problem was American policy—in particular, the American policy of supporting and strengthening Maliki at all costs. Maliki was a militant sectarian his whole life, and the United States should not have been surprised when he continued to act that way once he became Prime Minister. As Emma Sky, who served as a senior adviser to the American military during the war in Iraq, put it, “The problem was the policy, and the policy was to give unconditional support to Nuri al-Maliki.” (Sky’s book, “The Unraveling,” is the essential text on how everything fell apart.) When the Americans helped install him, in 2006, he was a colorless mediocrity with deeply sectarian views. By 2011, he was an unrivalled strongman with control over a vast military and security apparatus. Who enabled that?","1604","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"
"First, it was the Bush White House. Then the Obama White House—Clinton was a part of that team, of course, but the official with primary responsibility for Iraq was Vice-President Joe Biden. Biden was a firm backer of Maliki, because it was through Maliki that the Americans seemed sure of an easy exit.","1605","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"
"The real turning point in Iraq came not in 2011, when the last American troops departed, but in 2010, following national elections there. In the long deadlock that followed the voting, American diplomats backed away, acquiescing to an Iranian-brokered deal to allow Maliki to continue as Prime Minister. The constitutionality of the deal was deeply suspect, but the Americans averted their eyes. The Iranian price for backing Maliki was clear: he would throw out the American troops. “We were so focussed on getting out that we let the Iranians form the government,” Sky said.","1606","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-bush-right-about-clinton-and-iraq"

In this way he distinguished himself from the rest of the Republican field. The day before, in Miami, Jeb Bush swiped at Clinton—twice by name and a few more times by obvious implication—in his own announcement speech. Last month, launching his campaign, Marco Rubio posited himself as a perfect contrast to Clinton, warning that “a leader from yesterday began a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday. Yesterday is over.” (So is Trump’s restraint: within hours of his speech, he flew to Des Moines and accused Clinton of “playing the woman card really big.

The “brick phone,” in fact, is a favorite reference of Rubio, who is forty-four, and who has said that the Clintons arrived in Washington back when people were lugging those two-pounders around. Never mind that Motorola’s DynaTAC 8000X is a relic of the Reagan era, not of the nineteen-nineties (the age of the clamshell).

Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman, has also found his inner egalitarian, telling a gathering of conservatives in February that “if there’s not a private luxury jet and a quarter-million-dollar speaking fee waiting for her, you can forget” seeing Hillary Clinton in public.

If the Democrats ran a blue dog for President—not a centrist “blue dog” Democrat but an actual, barking blue dog—Republicans would call it a “liberal,” as Fiorina, Bush, and others are calling Clinton now. To Fiorina, Clinton’s announcement speech was a “long litany of left-wing causes”; Walker saw it as confirmation that “her views are out of touch with mainstream America.” Bush has been more precise. In April, he e-mailed supporters about a speech that Clinton gave on the rights of women and girls. “Hillary Clinton,” Bush wrote, “said that people’s deep-seated religious beliefs need to be changed in order to advance her own personal political agenda. Wow.” She didn’t say that, but Bush—to ingratiate himself with the religious right, which distrusts him—repeated the charge last Monday. The Republican electorate is being primed to expect the annihilation of individual freedom under a Hillary Clinton Administration. (Obama, it appears, hasn’t finished the job.) Rand Paul is promising #LibertyNotHillary; America, it’s one or the other.","1616","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

"For all the froth over the Benghazi attack—which made it an article of faith on the right that Clinton, as the Secretary of State, created what Rubio calls “global chaos”—there has been little talk of foreign policy on the campaign trail. Fiorina has been goading Clinton to “name an accomplishment” from her time at the State Department, while Fiorina’s rivals see a highlight reel of destruction. Ted Cruz has been rumbling about the “Obama-Clinton” axis for months now. Bush charges that a “phone-it-in foreign policy” is “leaving a legacy of crises uncontained, violence unopposed, enemies unnamed, friends undefended, and alliances unravelling.” (If that sounds like the rap on his brother’s Administration, Jeb is leaving the ironies unacknowledged.) None of the Republican candidates have particularly robust foreign-policy credentials, so, absent an international crisis of the first order, this will remain a secondary issue for now.","1618","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

"“I think people wonder,” Romney said on “Morning Joe,” “can they really trust Hillary Clinton?” Not if the G.O.P. can help it. And, in truth, Clinton has not helped herself on this score. Her use of a personal e-mail account to conduct State Department business and the Clinton Foundation’s acceptance of donations from foreign governments have stoked the engines of indignation on the right. Fiorina told a group of party activists that Clinton “tweets about women’s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights.” To Cruz, Clinton “embodies the corruption of Washington,” which is putting it mildly compared to Rand Paul, who charges both Clintons, flatly, with thinking that “they are above the law.”","1620","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"
"The focus on Hillary Clinton’s character is the one line of attack that appears to be registering with the broader electorate. Last Wednesday, Quinnipiac reported a “continuing slide” in the percentage of swing-state voters who view Clinton as honest and trustworthy. In Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the trust deficit is eight to fourteen points. It is unclear whether the Republican candidates can claim credit for this, or whether news coverage is what has driven Clinton’s numbers down. Certainly, the press corps has pursued the e-mail story and dug into the Clinton Foundation’s finances without any need of encouragement from the G.O.P.","1621","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"
"There is danger for Clinton in the trust gap, if it opens wider. When a candidate isn’t trusted to say what she means or do what she says, then it ceases to matter, really, what proposals she offers on renewable energy. But “trust,” as measured by polling firms, is an abstraction. The question that will decide the election is not “Do you trust this nominee?” but “Do you trust this nominee more than you trust the other nominee to make progress on the issues that matter to you?” On that question, Clinton should like her odds. While Bush, in the Quinnipiac poll, beats Clinton by four points on who’s more “honest and trustworthy,” Clinton tops him by fourteen points on “who understands the problems of people like you.” Bush isn’t alone in this deficiency. The whole Republican field is proudly, doggedly committed to a set of economic policies that reinforce the party’s identification with the already prosperous, and that has lost the popular vote in five out of the past six Presidential elections.","1622","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-case-against-clinton"

"Nathan Hornes, a twenty-five-year-old musician from Southern California, recently had a run of bad luck that changed his life. In 2010, after his mother insisted he pursue a higher degree, he chose a campus of Everest College, run by the for-profit Corinthian Colleges. “I thought I could go to school and be a pop star on the side,” he told me. Everest had a reputation among students for misleading marketing pitches and awful teachers, but the scope of the college’s problems didn’t become apparent until 2013, when the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed that they were investigating Corinthian.","August 11, 2015","1624","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"By then, Hornes was almost done getting his degree in management. He worked hard and did well at Everest, but by the time he graduated, in 2014, with tens of thousands of dollars in student loans, Corinthian’s legal problems had mounted. Later that year, the C.F.P.B. sued Corinthian, alleging that it had deceived students into taking on debt and then aggressively pursued them for repayment. Within months, Corinthian had shut down all of its campuses and declared itself bankrupt; at once, a degree from a Corinthian school became worthless. Hornes found work as a manager at the fast-food chain Smashburger—an accomplishment that he’s certain had nothing to do with his degree—and helped to start a protest movement in which former Corinthian students are refusing to repay their student loans. (After some commentators suggested that the students were acting like entitled children, Hornes posted a song to iTunes called “Confessions of a Spoiled Brat.”)","1625","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"Hornes told me that he wishes he could return to school, but doesn’t see himself doing so. The federal government is discharging some former Corinthian students’ loans, and Hornes has filed for consideration. In the meantime, he has surpassed the cap the government places on the amount a student can borrow for school. “At this point, I can barely afford to even live,” he said.","1626","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"Around the time that Hornes was discovering the worthlessness of his degree, Hillary Clinton was preparing to launch her campaign for President. Corinthian was often in the headlines, bringing attention to the broader student-debt crisis, in which student loans had, in just a couple of years, come to surpass car loans and credit-card bills to become the second-biggest form of debt, after mortgages. A senior policy adviser to the Clinton campaign, who didn’t want to be named, told me, “Last fall, when she was thinking about running for President, she called me and a couple of other people in to help her think about domestic-policy issues. When we began the process, the issue of college affordability and student debt was certainly on our radar screens and was a very big issue.” Clinton’s interest in the topic deepened as she toured the country and began to develop a platform focussed in large part on the economic conditions of the middle class. “She began to think, What does it mean to really make sure that we’re helping the middle class?” the adviser told me. Clinton came to feel that fixing the higher-education system was central to that goal, so she enlisted advice from several experts—among them a former education official, Robert Shireman, and a former student-loan ombudsman at the C.F.P.B., Rohit Chopra—to come up with a comprehensive plan.","1627","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"On Monday, Clinton presented her proposal, which would have the federal government spend three hundred and fifty billion dollars over ten years to make colleges more affordable and accountable to their students. More than half of that total would go toward grants to states and colleges. Clinton would reward states that stop disinvesting in higher education—and eventually spend more on public universities—and make it possible for students to graduate without debt; she would also keep the Obama Administration’s promise to make community colleges free. (Under Clinton’s plan, students would contribute to their tuition based on the wages from ten hours of work a week, while their families would give an amount based on their means.) A third of the three hundred and fifty billion would be spent to relieve students of some of their existing debt, partly by letting students refinance their loans at the current low interest rates. The rest—some fifteen to twenty per cent of the total—would be put to other uses, including investing in new forms of education and supporting student parents.","1628","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"In coverage of Clinton’s plans, the three-hundred-and-fifty-billion-dollar price tag, along with the candidate’s populist proposal to fund it by getting rid of some tax loopholes for the rich, have received a lot of attention. But just as noteworthy is the message Clinton is sending about structural problems with the higher-education system. For example, during and after the recession, states slashed their higher-education budgets, often raising public-university tuition rates to make up for it. Clinton’s proposal wouldn’t simply funnel money into public universities to make up for the decline in state funding; she would give the money only to those states that stabilize and increase their spending—essentially creating a new federal incentive to encourage states to change their policies.","1629","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"The decline in state budgets for higher education is one reason student debt has increased, but it’s not the only one, nor even, arguably, the most important one. For-profit colleges like Corinthian are responsible for a disproportionate number of student-debt defaults; according to a Senate report, students at for-profit colleges make up thirteen per cent of student-loan borrowers but forty-seven per cent of defaults. Truly dealing with the student-debt crisis, therefore, requires examining the for-profit sector. Clinton appears to recognize this. In a post she published on Monday on Medium, she wrote, “There are students who take out loans to pay for an expensive degree from a for-profit institution—only to find little support once they actually enroll, or they graduate and discover that, when it comes to finding a job, their degree isn’t worth what they thought.”","1630","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"The statistics are startling. Ninety-six per cent of students at for-profit colleges take on debt to attend school, compared with fifty-seven per cent at four-year private colleges, forty-eight per cent at four-year public colleges, and only thirteen per cent at community colleges. One reason students at for-profit colleges take out a lot of debt is because their schools have encouraged them to do so. In academic circles, this has inspired conversation about how to incentivize for-profit colleges to behave differently. One favored approach is to force colleges to share the risk that students take when they go into debt, by fining them if a high proportion of their students default on their loans. Clinton seems to support something like this—a fact sheet provided by her campaign says that she “will embrace bipartisan efforts for schools to share in the risk”—but the adviser I spoke with said she is still working out the details. Chopra, the former C.F.P.B. official, who has also advised the Clinton campaign, said that he isn’t familiar with the details of the candidate’s plan as it relates to risk-sharing by for-profit colleges, but he said that any higher-education reform plan has to deal with the structural problems in that sector. “The student-loan system works quite well for industry executives, but not so well for students,” he said.","1631","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"On Monday, I called Hornes, who had read about Clinton’s proposal with interest and felt it stood a chance of helping future students avoid getting into a mess like his. But he and other student activists envision a more radical future for higher education. Hornes feels that public U.S. universities should be free, as they are in Germany and some other countries; he also thinks the federal government should discharge the loans of all former Corinthian students. (Bernie Sanders, for his part, has proposed making public universities tuition-free and funding this with a tax on Wall Street trades, while Martin O’Malley, like Clinton, has put forth a plan to instead make college “debt-free.”)","1632","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"Ann Larson, an organizer with the student-debt protesters, suggested that for-profit colleges should be abolished altogether. Clinton’s campaign believes there is room for for-profit institutions in a functioning higher-education system; she is particularly intrigued by online-education startups like Coursera and Udacity, the adviser told me. I asked Larson to explain her position, pointing out that some people felt that the problems might be solved if for-profit colleges were just better regulated. She strenuously disagreed. “I think the idea of providing quality education to people in a democratic society is in contradiction to the idea of providing for-profit education,” she told me. “Look at the case of Corinthian. In order to maximize their profit—which is what corporations do—they took federal money to the tune of many billions of dollars from the student-loan program, and they funnelled it into these institutions where they provided very cheap, very substandard education, they overcharged students, and then they put students out of the street with worthless debt and pocketed the money. This is what happens when the profit motive supersedes the educational motive.”","1633","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-hillary-clintons-college-plan-go-far-enough"
"On August 11th, Hillary Clinton met privately with five Black Lives Matter activists in Keene, New Hampshire. The activists had arrived at Clinton’s campaign stop shortly before it was to begin, but they were not allowed to enter because the room was filled to capacity. So the campaign reached out to the activists and arranged a time for a meeting after the event. Last week, video of the sixteen-minute, behind-closed-doors conversation was released. Clinton appeared measured and tense at times, holding her hands tightly in front of her. She listened carefully to the activists and gave thoughtful, unscripted, and sometimes impassioned answers to questions about her past support for policies that have harmed communities of color.","August 27, 2015","1634","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"

The U.S. prison system became the largest in the world during the Clinton Administration, with more people in prison or jail than ever before in American history. It was her husband’s bill, but, as First Lady, Hillary Clinton lobbied for its passage. Speaking at the annual conference of the National Center for Women and Policing, in 1994, for example, she said, “We need more police; we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders.”","1635","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"
"During the backstage meeting after her campaign event, Clinton made an honest, candid effort to explain to the activists that the crime bill—one of the most comprehensive pieces of criminal-justice legislation in U.S. history—was a sincere attempt to address a particular set of problems that emerged during the nineteen-eighties and nineties. At three hundred and fifty-six pages, the bill included provisions that aimed to protect vulnerable populations and reduce crime, such as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, the establishment of registries for sex offenders, the Violence Against Women Act, and penalty enhancements for hate crimes.","1636","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"

How do you actually feel that is different than how you felt before?”","1637","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"

The abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison used fiery and fervid lectures to change the hearts of his pro-slavery detractors, and reformers including Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, and many other ex-slaves penned autobiographies to change the hearts of Northern readers by enabling them to catch sight of the unspeakable horrors endured by enslaved people. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” published in 1852, sold three hundred thousand copies in its first year. “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” made its readers acutely aware of the brutal violence, the painful family separations, and the inhumane buying and selling of children that were all commonplace under the slave regime.","1641","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/actually-hillary-hearts-do-change"

These candidates often did well with white progressives, but they could never expand their appeal to other Democratic base groups. Only Barack Obama was able to succeed by winning African-American voters away from Hillary Clinton, who was the establishment front-runner in 2008.

"This was not entirely reassuring, precisely because of how scornful Clinton was about a legitimate concern: foreign governments, and domestic businesses, attempting to buy access by means of donations to the foundation or speaker fees. When McFadden asked about specifics, such as tax forms that failed to list foreign donors, his answers went from breezy to testy. (“The guy that filled out the forms made an error…. Now that is a bigger problem, according to the press, than the other people running for President willing to take dark money, secret money, secret from beginning to end?”) And yet his digressive manner made it difficult—almost impossible—to tell where he and the foundation begin and end. He said that Hillary Clinton, when she was at State, had told him, “No one has ever tried to influence me by helping you.” Are “me” and “you” the two of them or the Department and the foundation? (This is also why it matters that Hillary Clinton put her name on what had been the William J. Clinton Foundation, after leaving government in 2013.) He called the controversy about their relations to donors a “very deliberate attempt to take the foundation down.” He may have been referring, at least in part, to Peter Schweizer’s book “Clinton Cash,” which comes out tomorrow. It’s a flawed, partisan, and at times sloppy work that is easy for the Clintons and their supporters to attack. But the book’s imperfect reporting provided leads that have also proved easy for other journalists to pursue—at the Times, for example, where the result was a troubling story centered on a Russian-Canadian uranium company.","1664","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-much-money-does-bill-clinton-need"
"Bill Clinton also would not say whether he would keep his position at the foundation—where his responsibilities include making connections, asking for and giving favors, and, directly or indirectly, solicitating of money—if his wife became President. “Well, I’ll decide. If it’s the right thing to do, I will.” When McFadden pressed him to say which situations would lead him to consider stepping down, he said, “Well, I might if I were asked to do something in the public interest that I had an obligation to do. Or I might take less of an executive role.” In other words, if any individuals think that he should not be travelling the world and talking oligarchs into helping pay for charitable projects with his name on them, they should find him a more interesting job. Clinton added, “I mean, I really—I work at this. And I’m involved in this as you can see. So I might do that. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.”","1665","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-much-money-does-bill-clinton-need"
"When he was President, one of Bill Clinton’s favorite refrains was about “crossing that bridge to the twenty-first century,” and, given all that he has endured politically, he may be the preëminent improvisatory bridge-crosser of our time. So why can’t he see that he has already come to this bridge? Does he really not see a conflict in sitting with one of those wealthy people in a room where all the possible destinations for that person’s money—the foundation, the campaign, a super PAC, a speaker’s bureau—could be on the table at once? Perhaps, after the end of Bill Clinton’s Presidency, in early 2001, the family did feel financially stretched. Former Presidents have made a tradition of cashing in to afford a comfortable retirement and, as Clinton pointed out to McFadden, of taking money from all sorts of places in order to build their libraries or do good in the world. All that is fine. But the Clintons would like to return to the White House, and that comes with obligations.","1666","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-much-money-does-bill-clinton-need"
"To get over this particular bridge, Bill Clinton first has to stop making paid speeches, as Hillary has done. Second, as painful and as unfair as it seems, he ought to step aside from the foundation now, and arrange its management structure to create something like the distance a blind trust would provide. Third, the foundation needs to remedy the missteps that it has made on transparency. This includes, as I’ve written before, what amounts to the franchising of the Clinton name to a foreign charity, the Canadian Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, a step that the Clinton Foundation believes allowed it to ignore its disclosure commitments. The Times identified twenty million dollars donated to the Canadian Clinton entity whose source had not been disclosed. The Clintons still have time to assuage concerns about the foundation and underscore their commitment to transparency, even if it means that Bill Clinton can’t do all the good work in the world that he believes he should be doing. When the election campaign is heavily under way, the financial entanglements—and partisan attacks—will only increase. Hillary Clinton may still win big, but why let the process get uglier and more damaging to her?","1667","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-much-money-does-bill-clinton-need"
"“There is no doubt in my mind that we have never done anything knowingly inappropriate in terms of taking money to influence any kind of American government policy,” Bill Clinton told McFadden. But they need to erase any doubts in the minds of the voters that they do know what’s appropriate.

"On the night of October 11, 2012, Barack Obama loped across the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, looking as if he were trying hard not to grin. It was a change of mood; eight days earlier, he had done poorly in his first Presidential debate with Mitt Romney, and the feeling in his campaign was gloomy. But, that evening, Vice-President Joe Biden had had his first debate with Paul Ryan, during which he called out the Romney campaign on its “malarkey.” Some commentators thought that he had looked foolish—he’d laughed a lot, and when Biden laughs, he throws back his head. (Mark Salter, the Republican operative, called the Obama-Biden debate combination “sleepy cop/crystal-meth cop.”) But even many of the critics thought that he’d won. He had reminded a lot of people of why they wanted a Democrat in the White House, particularly on questions like income inequality. One of those people seems to have been Obama himself. He’d watched the debate on Air Force One and, though there wasn’t a plan for him to speak to reporters, he swung over to where they were standing.","June 12, 2015","1669","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

So I’m very proud of him.”","1670","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Obama also seemed, in the days to come, more proud of himself. Having Biden with him on the ticket in 2012 helped him win and, it seemed, helped make him a better President when he did. That was the case when what was scoffed at as yet another instance of Bidenic indiscipline—getting ahead of his boss by saying that he was “absolutely comfortable” with full legal recognition of same-sex marriage—led Obama, too, to say what he actually believed, and arrive at a place where he felt proud to be.","1671","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The idea that a person could make those around him better came up again this past weekend, when Obama delivered the eulogy for Biden’s son, Beau, who had died of brain cancer, at the age of forty-six. The Vice-President, by all accounts, was hit hard by his son’s death. In 1973, he had taken his Senate oath next to the hospital bed where Beau lay, at age three, after surviving the car crash that had killed Biden’s wife and daughter. He was also the son who had served in the reserves in Iraq, been elected as the attorney general of Delaware, and one day, perhaps, could go even further in politics than his father had. “He even looked and sounded like Joe, although I think Joe would be first to acknowledge that Beau was an upgrade—Joe 2.0,” Obama said. He added, “That’s who Beau was. Someone who cared. Someone who charmed you, and disarmed you, and put you at ease. When he’d have to attend a fancy fund-raiser with people who took themselves way too seriously, he’d walk over to you and whisper something wildly inappropriate in your ear.” (Joe Biden, for his part, has been known to whisper wildly inappropriate things, but when he was, for example, caught on an open mic telling Obama that the passage of the Affordable Care Act was “a big fucking deal,” he was reminding Obama that he should take something seriously.) At the funeral, Obama said that he loved Biden. The two have a weekly lunch; the most recent one was on Wednesday, Biden’s first day back at work since Beau’s death.","1672","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

And it can only make the Democratic Party better.","1673","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Last year, Evan Osnos spoke to the Vice-President for a New Yorker Profile, and, Osnos wrote, “I asked Biden how he will respond if opponents say he is too old to be President. ‘I think it’s totally legitimate for people to raise it,’ he said. ‘And I’ll just say, Look at me. Decide.’ ’’ Biden is seventy-two. Hillary Clinton is sixty-seven. More tellingly, Biden added, “I watched my father. I made a mistake in encouraging him to retire. I just think as long as you think you can do it and you’re physically healthy….”","1674","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"The Clintons have become very wealthy as a result of their book deals, speaking fees, and other endeavors—they have made thirty million dollars just since Hillary left the State Department. (Bill Clinton recently said that he would consider giving up paid speeches—after Hillary wins.) Joe Biden is not a very wealthy man. By one estimate, his net worth is between thirty-nine thousand and eight hundred thousand dollars; by another, with his mortgage figured in, it is a negative number. (Biden: “But I got a great pension and I got a good salary!”) Which way does that cut, for each of them? Perhaps it makes a Biden campaign less feasible, in that he has less flexibility; it might also make it more desirable, depending on one’s definition of independence.","1675","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"Last week, Hillary Clinton almost lost to Bernie Sanders in a Wisconsin straw poll (the tally was forty-nine per cent to forty-one), but Sanders, who can reasonably be called a socialist, is not likely to be the one who makes clear what her real general-election vulnerabilities are, or how to overcome them. Biden would. He may have no chance of winning. But he is a more plausible candidate than anyone Clinton is facing now, and perhaps the best answer to the fear that, as the Republicans fight it out among themselves, she will drift through until the convention, with a stray glance at Martin O’Malley, and enter the general election unprepared for the fight. Obama was right about Biden’s debate with Ryan: rewatching it is a good reminder of his ability to speak plainly and in detail about Democratic economic policies—something that involves more than just throwing out lines about level playing fields. (Republicans have been doing that, too.) Maybe Hillary Clinton, in a speech she’s scheduled to give on Saturday, will find a way to make those themes work for her. She hasn’t yet.","1676","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"And, although she served four years as Secretary of State, Biden has a deeper background in foreign policy, with years as a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a skepticism about things like troop deployments that might appeal to noninterventionists—who can be found across the spectrum. His 2006 proposal for Iraq—reshaping the country into a loose three-part federation—also much derided, does not, in light of recent events, look all that bad. (As it is, a sectarian Shiite-dominated central government unwilling to give a voice or commit resources to Sunni and Kurdish regions has contributed to the rise of ISIS.)","1677","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"
"But how, might one ask, could Biden win in a general election when Obama, his boss, is so unpopular? That question points to what may be one of the most interesting results of having Biden in the race. Hillary Clinton would have to decide where she really stands on the Obama Presidency, in all its aspects, and say what she thinks about it. (He was her boss, too.) Her advisers have made it clear that she’s counting on the Obama coalition; how tied are their votes to the Obama legacy? Clinton needs a response that doesn’t just involve hinting that everything would have been better if she’d been elected in 2008. She tried out some jabs at Obama, in an interview with the Atlantic last August, in which, quoting one of his mantras, she said, “Great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” and called his choices on Syria a “failure.” Her spokesman said afterward that she hadn’t meant to criticize the President, and looked forward “to hugging it out.” The message there, whatever it was, got muddled. Biden’s presence might clarify it, and present some interesting choices to Democratic primary voters—and to Obama, who might not endorse anyone before the nomination, but could give a few hints of his preference along the way.","1678","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/why-joe-biden-should-run"

"The relationship between Senator Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton, the Party’s most likely Presidential nominee, goes back to the second half of the Clinton Administration. Warren told me recently that the most dramatic policy fight of her life was one in which Bill and Hillary Clinton were intimately involved. She recalls it as the “ten-year war.” Between 1995 and 2005, Warren, a professor who had established herself as one of the country’s foremost experts on bankruptcy law, managed to turn an arcane issue of financial regulation into a major political issue.","1680","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In the late nineteen-nineties, Congress was trying to pass a bankruptcy bill that Warren felt was written, essentially, by the credit-card industry. For several years, through a growing network of allies in Washington, she helped liberals in Congress fight the bill, but at the end of the Clinton Administration the bill seemed on the verge of passage. Clinton’s economic team was divided, much as Democrats today are split over economic policy. His progressive aides opposed the bill; aides who were more sympathetic to the financial industry supported it. Warren targeted the one person in the White House who she believed could stop the legislation: the First Lady. They met alone for half an hour, and, according to Warren, Hillary stood up and declared, “Well, I’m convinced. It is our job to stop that awful bill. You help me and I’ll help you.” In the Administration’s closing weeks, Hillary persuaded Bill Clinton not to sign the legislation, effectively vetoing it.","1681","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"But just a few months later, in 2001, Hillary was a senator from New York, the home of the financial industry, and she voted in favor of a version of the same bill. It passed, and George W. Bush signed it into law, ending Warren’s ten-year war with a crushing defeat. “There were a lot of people who voted for that bill who thought that there was going to be no political price to pay,” Warren told me.","1682","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren is not running for President. But she is mounting a campaign to insure that Clinton and other prominent Democrats adhere to her agenda of reversing income inequality and beating back the influence of corporate power in politics. These are issues that Warren has pursued for three decades, as an academic, a policy adviser to Democrats, an Obama Administration regulator, and, since 2012, a U.S. senator and the anchor of a progressive wing of the Democratic Party.","1683","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Clinton has taken notice. Last December, she invited Warren to a private meeting at her Washington home, near Embassy Row, to hear Warren’s advice on issues such as income inequality. In recent months, members of Clinton’s policy team have consulted with Dan Geldon, one of Warren’s closest advisers, about economic policy. And a few days after Clinton’s official announcement, on April 12th, that she is running for President, she wrote a paean to Warren in Time, saying that Warren “never hesitates to hold powerful people’s feet to the fire: bankers, lobbyists, senior government officials and, yes, even presidential aspirants.”","1684","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Clinton even sounds like Warren these days, evidently hoping to fend off charges that she is a captive of Wall Street money and influence. In the video in which Clinton announced her candidacy, she says, “The deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top.” Two days later, during a stop in Iowa, she noted, “Hedge-fund managers pay lower taxes than nurses or the truckers I saw on I-80, when I was driving here over the last two days.” And in a fund-raising e-mail she wrote, “The average CEO makes 300 times what the average worker makes.”","1685","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Clinton’s people insist that any similarity to Warren is coincidental. “Hillary was talking about rising inequality and how the deck was stacked against people in 2007 and 2008,” Neera Tanden, the head of the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank, and a policy adviser to Hillary Clinton, said. “I see a lot of overlap. I do not see a causal link from one person to the other.” The Warren camp seems to have a different view. Last week, Warren’s advisers privately circulated a picture showing the two women sitting beside each other, a quote bubble emanating from Clinton: “What she said.” When I asked Warren last week if she believed that Clinton was co-opting her message, she hesitated and replied, “Eh.” She added, “She’s laying out her vision for the country and she deserves an opportunity to do that.” Warren may have decided not to run because she felt she couldn’t win. But Clinton’s populist turn signals another possibility: Warren feels that she can accomplish more from the sidelines.","1686","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“I think she’s doing exactly the right thing,” Barney Frank, the former congressman from Massachusetts, told me recently, referring to Warren. “Right now, she’s as powerful a spokesperson on public policy as you could be in the minority.” Frank worked closely with Warren in the House on financial-reform legislation to curb the power of banks. “She has an absolute veto over certain public-policy issues, because Democrats are not going to cross her. And if she were to even hint at being a candidate that would be over.” He added, “Democrats are afraid of Elizabeth Warren. No Democrat wants Elizabeth Warren being critical of him.”","1687","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren believes that, when it comes to economic policy, there is a Wall Street view and a Main Street view, and Democrats must choose sides. Her critics argue that this is simplistic and naïve, but she has buoyed many on the left who are critical of President Obama’s economic policies and advisers for being excessively influenced by Wall Street. Warren was especially unimpressed by the President’s first Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, who was appointed at the start of the financial crisis. “I was shocked that he picked the person who had just done the bailouts through the New York Fed,” she said. “I assumed that the President would want to carve a different path, and want to separate himself from the Republican-led bailout.” She added, “Tim Geithner came from the New York Fed, which, effectively, works for Wall Street.” (Geithner declined to respond on the record to Warren’s criticism of him.)","1688","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In the final year and a half of the Obama Administration, Warren will continue to take on the President over issues such as international trade and his choices for Treasury Department positions, but she will be focussing more intently on influencing Clinton. In the past two weeks, in the wake of Warren’s forceful opposition, Clinton has backed away from a major trade agreement with Asian countries that, as Secretary of State, she had helped to negotiate. But, as Warren knows, Clinton can be an inconsistent ally. Her challenge over the next year and a half is to make sure that Hillary Clinton’s embrace of Warrenism is a lasting one.","1689","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"On a shelf in her Boston office, Warren keeps a glass bowl of large rocks, a gift from her advisers during the 2012 Senate campaign, when she would often say to them, “I want to throw rocks.” When I visited her in Washington in late February, though, she was in a theatrical mood, reprising a scene from the early nineteen-seventies, when she was struggling to balance the strains of new motherhood, a failing marriage, and law school. Splayed out on a chair, she demonstrated how she drove her Volkswagen Beetle with one hand, reaching with the other into the back seat to keep the baby awake.","1690","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“No, no, no!” she yelled. “Wake up, baby, wake up, wake up! Just a little bit longer! Just a little bit longer! Do we remember the sunshine song?” She began to sing “You Are My Sunshine.” At the time, Warren said, she couldn’t get her homework finished unless her daughter napped at home; that meant keeping the baby awake on the drive back from the babysitter after class. “I learned to shift through the steering wheel, so as not to let go of that baby,” Warren said. Once, she crashed the car. “I rolled right into someone while doing that. Caved in the whole front end of that VW Beetle.”","1691","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren’s attempts at drama can feel forced. In her memoir, she frequently recalls times when she was “stunned” or “furious,” or when she “clenched” her teeth at the “vile” actions of the big banks. Her more compelling moments, captured on video, feature her passionately defending the role of government or pummelling committee witnesses—government regulators or bankers who have made the mistake of arguing a point with Warren, a former high-school debate champion. She has cultivated a public image as a fierce and uncompromising fighter, although her critics in business and politics sometimes use other words.","1692","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“I think that she would do better if she were less angry and demonized less,” Warren Buffett, the C.E.O. and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, recently complained on CNBC. Several commentators denounced Buffett, an ardent supporter of Hillary Clinton, as sexist, but one of Warren’s close advisers told me that her aides acknowledge the criticism. “I would modify her vitriol, because I think it gratuitously creates enemies,” the adviser said. “There is a grain of truth in what Buffett said.”","1693","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren is driven in part by an awareness of the obstacles that she had to overcome to achieve professional success. She grew up in Oklahoma City in the nineteen-fifties, the youngest of four and the only girl. “All I ever wanted to do was be a teacher,” she said. “It must have been miserable to be one of my dolls, because I used to line them up and teach school.” In her 2014 memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” she describes herself in high school as “tall,” “self-conscious,” and cursed with crooked teeth. Her mother told her to get married early, but she secretly sent away for college applications and, on the strength of her debate-team skills, won a full scholarship to George Washington University, in D.C. After two years, she dropped out of college and, at nineteen, married Jim Warren, whom she had dated in high school.","1694","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"

She knew little about the subject, apart from her experiences of financial insecurity growing up. By the time Warren was born, the family’s finances were deteriorating. Her father, who served as a flight instructor in the Second World War, had sought a job flying but was passed over because of his age. He had lost all his money starting a car dealership, and then he was injured in a car crash.","1696","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“It was a life lived just at the edge of economic survival,” Warren said. “When I got sick, my mother would lean down, put her hand against my forehead, and then step back and do the calculation: how sick I seemed to be versus how big was the outstanding bill with Dr. Buffington.”","1697","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Eventually, her father found a job selling carpeting, and the family bought a station wagon and moved to a bigger house in Oklahoma City.

"At the University of Texas, Warren joined with two other professors to study what kind of people declare bankruptcy. At the time, the common view of most legal scholars and many politicians was that the bankruptcy laws were being abused by people cheating the system. Warren initially thought the same. “I’d gone into this research to prove that those people who filed for bankruptcy were different from us,” she said. “We’d had hard times, but we’d never filed for bankruptcy.” Jay Westbrook, one of Warren’s collaborators, who still teaches at the University of Texas Law School, told me, “We had a picture in our mind of sort of shiftless people who weren’t very careful with their money.”","1699","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren and her colleagues travelled to courthouses around the country and gathered data on hundreds of bankruptcy cases. There were no electronic records, so they flew from city to city with a portable Xerox machine that they called R2-D2. In academic legal circles, theoretical work was a surer path to a tenured position than empirical field research, but Warren and her colleagues stayed with it for almost a decade. One of the first cases she reviewed involved a middle-class couple who committed suicide before they could appear at their court hearing. “I looked at that and I thought, Yeah, I know people who would make that choice,” she said.","1700","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The data revealed that, by the early nineteen-eighties, a growing number of middle-class Americans were resorting to bankruptcy, and that most debtors were homeowners. “I will never forget the day that we did that data run,” Westbrook said. “We couldn’t believe it. We checked the computer three times.” Debtors were not irresponsible slackers but families hit with the sudden loss of a job, a divorce, or a bad car accident, which depleted their savings and pushed them into financial ruin. Bankruptcies were going up because of mounting economic stress on the middle class.","1701","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 1987, Warren moved on to a job at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, teaching contract law and bankruptcy; in 1995, she went to Harvard. “She broke the news about what the actual practices and effects of the bankruptcy law were,” Martha Minow, the dean of Harvard Law School, told me. “That put her on the map and made a lot of people interested.”","1702","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren said that her early research has informed everything she’s studied since. She noted that by 1975 productivity and median wages, which until then had risen together, had started to decouple: the former continued to rise while the latter remained flat. Meanwhile, bankruptcy filings soared, regardless of how the economy was doing. “A problem that looks real but small and at the margins in the nineteen-eighties has moved to the center by the nineties,” Warren said, “and by the two-thousands it’s starting to hollow out America’s middle class.”","1703","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren tells her life story as a series of confrontations. Early on, she fought to escape her bad marriage and pursue a professional career; later, she fought against an élitist legal academy that looked down on her credentials and her research interests. In the late eightes and early nineties, at the University of Pennsylvania, she mostly avoided the debates over faculty diversity that were then seizing the campus. She was a registered Republican, and “was not viewed as a champion of women or minorities,” the Boston Globe noted, in 2012. “Silent on the race and gender wars that divided campuses in the nineteen-eighties and nineteen-nineties, she was never a liberal crusader.” Warren told me that she was immersed in her scholarship and wary of political fights outside her areas of expertise.","1704","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 1994, Congress created a commission to make policy recommendations on how to reform the bankruptcy laws. Mike Synar, Bill Clinton’s first appointee to run the commission, recruited Warren to serve as the top policy adviser. Conservative and pro-lender members of the panel argued that the laws were too easy on debtors and encouraged reckless behavior, a position shared by the banks. The pro-consumer side, arguing for more lenient terms for Americans who go broke, often had a one-vote majority on the panel. Many of the big issues were decided by a vote of five to four. “This was the first time that I’m aware of that Elizabeth was exposed to and part of the crucible of politics,” a member of the panel said. By the end of her work on the commission, in 1997, Warren was a Democrat.","1705","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Congress mostly ignored the group’s work and adopted the industry-friendly bill, which many Democratic legislators, along with some of Bill Clinton’s senior advisers, favored. Warren went to see Gene Sperling, Clinton’s top economic aide in the White House, who opposed the legislation. She showed him a stream of hard data and offered talking points about how the legislation would hurt families in economic distress, but the situation looked hopeless. By 1999, while Clinton was recovering from the Lewinsky scandal of his second term, the bill had gained support in a Republican Congress. In addition, the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, was from South Dakota, the heart of the credit-card industry, and he strongly supported the bill.","1706","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“It was tough to know what to do, as we were facing veto-proof majorities in both Houses,” Sperling told me. “Warren really did have an impact. She had amassed data to show that a lot of the rise in bankruptcies was due not to deadbeats but to medical debt and women hurt by divorce. Her facts helped buck up both Clintons to keep fighting for a better bill and gave those of us in the trenches good ammo and amendment strategies.” The White House slowed the legislation’s progress through Congress, and when it finally did pass, in 2000, Clinton, in one of his last acts as President, refused to sign it, effectively vetoing it. A White House aide later told Warren that, two days after her meeting with the First Lady, the White House economic team flipped its position “so fast that you could see skid marks in the hallways of the White House.”","1707","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The following year, Bill Clinton was replaced by George W. Bush. A new version of the bill was introduced. In Warren’s 2003 book, “The Two-Income Trap,” she describes what happened next:","1708","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In 2005, a decade after Warren began her crusade against the bill, the legislation was signed into law by Bush. “We held them off for ten years, and that’s about thirteen or fourteen million families that made it through the system,” Warren told me. The delay, she added, proved that Wall Street was not as powerful in Washington as it had imagined. “The big banks thought they’d just roll in and pick up a few percentage points’ increase in their bottom line, because they could squeeze families a little harder when they were right on the edge and they could get just a few more dollars. They thought they had it made.”","1709","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren’s book became a surprise hit among Democratic policymakers. During the 2004 Democratic Presidential primaries, John Edwards called Warren to discuss it, and John Kerry mentioned it in a speech, declaring it “one of the best books that actually describes the transformation that has taken place in America.” It also earned the admiration of Dr. Phil, the TV psychologist, who invited Warren to appear on his show to talk about how families could remain financially stable in a world of predatory lending. Warren offered some unremarkable advice about the dangers of taking out a second mortgage to pay off other debts, but it altered the course of her career. The show had reached six million viewers, and she later wrote, “I might have done more good than in an entire year as a professor.”","1710","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"When I called Dr. Phil, whose full name is Phillip McGraw, he said that he and Warren have remained friends over the years. “I was really intrigued by that book,” he said. “But I didn’t think it was particularly written for the general populace.” He told me that after the show he said to Warren that her book was “too technically intense and it’s not reader-friendly.” He encouraged her to write and speak to a much larger audience.","1711","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"One of Warren’s lesser-known skills is an ability to build unlikely alliances. For years, she has worked closely with Camden Fine, the head of the Independent Community Bankers of America, who is considered by some to be one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington. In the financial world, community bankers see themselves as representatives of Main Street America, and they are often at odds with the financial behemoths on Wall Street. On a recent Friday, Fine, who is from Jefferson City, Missouri, greeted me in his office, on L Street, wearing pleated khakis and a striped button-down shirt. He radiates the image of the kind of small-town bank president who might have given your grandfather a loan on little more than a handshake. The walls and shelves of his office are filled with St. Louis Cardinals paraphernalia and Civil War artifacts, next to thank-you notes from Barney Frank and other politicians.","1712","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine represents some sixty-five hundred small banks across the country. Frank told me, “It’s the smaller businesses that have natural grassroots networks: Realtors, mortgage brokers, auto dealers, community banks. They’re in everybody’s district and they tend to have a very extroverted corporate culture: ‘Hi, how are ya, can I sell ya a car?’ Extremely good on TV.”","1713","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Community banks, which typically are local and often have less than a billion dollars in assets, are good at getting what they want out of Congress, but they are also considered more consumer-friendly than large financial conglomerates, such as Citigroup or Bank of America. In June of 2009, Elizabeth Warren went to visit Fine. For the four years since losing the bankruptcy fight, she had continued to teach and write at Harvard, but she remained politically active. In the months before the 2007-08 financial crisis, she became increasingly vocal about Wall Street’s mortgage-lending practices and wrote an article in a new policy journal, Democracy, that warned of the dangers of subprime-mortgage lending. The title of the article, “Unsafe at Any Rate,” echoed Ralph Nader’s 1965 book, “Unsafe at Any Speed,” about the dangers of the unregulated automobile industry. Warren called for the creation of a new government agency that would do for financial products what the Consumer Product Safety Commission, created in 1972 by Richard Nixon, had done for toys, appliances, and other items.","1714","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house,” she wrote. “But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out on the street.”","1715","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren did not predict the subsequent financial meltdown in all its particulars, but her warning about the dangers of unregulated lending was prescient. “It was like watching a train wreck and standing on the side,” she told me. “You were screaming at people to stop doing this: ‘Wait, slow down, there’s gonna be a crash here.’ But nobody could make their voice heard on this.” She places much of the blame on the Federal Reserve, which had the regulatory tools to address the housing bubble: “Alan Greenspan”—the former Federal Reserve chairman—“inflated the bubble, and he did it either knowingly or with reckless abandon.”","1716","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In late 2008, after the crash, Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate, called Warren in Cambridge and asked her to serve on a new Congressional Oversight Panel, which was charged with monitoring how the federal government was spending the seven hundred billion dollars that was being used to bail out the financial sector. Jim Manley, Reid’s spokesman at the time, said, “Reid had heard her speak, and like everyone else was impressed by her ability to break complex issues down into sound bites that people can understand.” Reid told me, “She’d done a lot of writing on poor people. Nobody knew who she was, but she was great. Everybody liked her.” Warren temporarily gave up her teaching duties and moved to Washington.","1717","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Reid’s decision was not greeted warmly by the new Obama Administration. Treasury Secretary Geithner resented Warren’s use of the panel to question his policies in the middle of the crisis, and Warren complained that he denied many of her requests for information. “There was this feeling that Elizabeth Warren was pretty sophisticated,” a former Obama official said. “And when we’re getting hit everywhere she should be a little more sympathetic. She was somebody who was supposed to be on your side, and she carried more weight against you because she was a Democrat and was well regarded on these issues.”","1718","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren told me, “We were there to do oversight, and it made no difference to me whether there was a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. Our only consideration should be the American people, not whose feelings in government might get hurt or whose political careers might be advanced.” Warren said her work on the panel studying Treasury’s practices taught her that Obama’s economic advisers were even more beholden to the banks than she had understood. “The Treasury Department believed in saving those at the top, and didn’t worry much about the rest of America,” she said.","1719","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren was well known in liberal policy circles, but Geithner had never heard of her until she became his overseer and summoned him to testify. He felt that she was much better at complaining about what she was against than at articulating what she was for. In his recent memoir, “Stress Test,” Geithner calls Warren “one of our most ardent and eloquent liberal critics” but chastises her for not offering him more specific policy suggestions during the financial crisis.","1720","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren quickly realized that, although she could hold hearings and write reports, her panel had no more authority than her old blue-ribbon bankruptcy commission. Those writing the new rules for financial regulation had the real power. Warren thought she had a chance to get a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into the emerging law, so she stopped excoriating Geithner, and met with Fine, the bank lobbyist. She knew that public opposition to the protection bureau on his part could kill it.","1721","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“The Wall Street crowd constantly tries to use my members almost like human shields to try to get their stuff through, because they know that Congress likes smaller banks,” Fine told me. Warren took the same approach. She doubted that she could persuade Fine to support the agency, but, if the community banks simply remained neutral, that would be a victory. “We had not totally developed our position yet,” Fine said. “But we were very, very skeptical and were making noise that we were going to oppose the creation of that agency.”","1722","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine viewed Warren as a left-wing activist, hostile to the interests of his member banks, most of which were run by Republicans. “In the financial industry, Professor Warren was regarded as a little loopy, way out there on the fringe, and was not taken all that seriously,” he said. “So I told my assistant, I’ll spend thirty minutes with this loopy woman and then come get me and just make an excuse that I’ve got a call or something.”","1723","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Instead, Fine and Warren spoke for two hours. Warren played on Fine’s fears of the Wall Street banks, explaining that under current law small community banks were subject to more intense regulatory scrutiny than the large financial institutions. She argued that even if Fine and his members hated the idea of any additional regulation, at least her agency would make the mega-banks face the same kinds of review. “You need to give this agency a chance,” Warren told him.","1724","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine got up from the table where we were sitting and retrieved a document from his desk drawer. “I debated about showing this to a reporter, but it’s historic,” he told me. It was an e-mail he’d sent to the members of his executive committee the day after his meeting with Warren. At the top of the memo, in bold caps, it said:","1725","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The e-mail recapped Fine’s meeting with Warren and laid out his group’s political strategy for the coming fight over Dodd-Frank, the bill that was to overhaul regulation of the financial industry. Warren “bluntly told us that she was meeting with I. C. B. A. instead of A. B. A.”—the American Bankers Association, which is dominated by the large Wall Street firms—“because she feels strongly that our understanding and support of her recommendation to create the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency is vital to its success,” Fine wrote. “She said that she wants community banks to get behind it. Her argument is that the big banks can afford to absorb continued and increasing regulatory burden, but that smaller banks cannot; and that if we don’t do something about the burden the big banks will crush us.”","1726","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine argued that Warren’s vision for the agency would not be so bad for community banks, but he did worry that her approach was too theoretical. “Dr. Warren is an academic, and thinks like an academic,” he wrote. “She has taught contract law,” and she “has never been out of academia. While I found her arguments compelling, they were terribly naïve. That said, if we are clever, I believe we can work with her and perhaps shape an agency that has little impact on community banks but a huge impact on the unregulated part of the financial-services industry.”","1727","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"He said that, even if his group decided to publicly oppose the agency, it needed to work with Warren to shape the legislation. “Over all, it was a very good and enlightening meeting,” he concluded. “We might be able to turn lemons into lemonade yet.” Fine persuaded his trade group to remain neutral about Warren’s agency.","1728","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren effectively co-opted Fine and his members as allies against Wall Street. As the Dodd-Frank bill made its way through Congress, in 2010, Fine’s willingness to tolerate it was crucial. With Warren’s blessing, Barney Frank, who sponsored the bill in the House, negotiated a deal with Fine that allowed community banks to be examined by their current regulators rather than by Warren’s new agency. “They were the ones with the clout, and that’s why I had to make a deal with Cam,” Frank told me. Warren signed off on it. “She was willing to do what she had to do as long as it didn’t give away substance,” Frank said. “Every time we came to one of those things where, to save the great bulk of the bill, we had to make some kind of concession, she understood it and was very helpful in selling it.”","1729","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Geithner, long pilloried as doing the bidding of bankers, couldn’t resist pointing out the irony of Warren and Frank’s accommodation with Fine. “The smaller community banks, with members in every congressional district, got themselves largely carved out of the new consumer agency’s direct supervision, despite our resistance,” he wrote in his memoir. But, in exchange for the concession, Fine promised Frank that he wouldn’t oppose the agency, a position that Frank told me secured the support of many wavering centrist Democrats and helped insure the bill’s passage.","1730","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"On July 21, 2010, Obama signed the new law in a ceremony in Washington. Valerie Jarrett, his longtime adviser, oversaw the seating chart for the event, and she instructed her staff to place Warren in the front row, between former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and the chairman, Ben Bernanke. Warren had accomplished something extraordinarily rare for an academic: she had turned a policy-journal idea for a new government agency into the real thing. Now she wanted to run it.","1731","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Many liberals were pressing Obama to nominate Warren to head the new agency, and fifty-seven representatives and eleven senators sent him a letter endorsing the idea. The White House did not appreciate the pressure. “I was pushing hard for her, and Obama got annoyed with me,” Frank said.","1732","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Soon after the bill signing, Warren and Jarrett met in Jarrett’s office, in the West Wing. At the meeting, Jarrett asked Warren, “Can you be confirmed?”","1733","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren had cultivated Jarrett as an ally, much as she had Camden Fine. The two women met soon after Warren first arrived in Washington, in early 2009, and they regularly dined together and talked about policy. In the early days, the Obama Administration was dominated by male economic advisers whom many critics on the left considered too sympathetic to the large banks. Warren helped Jarrett serve as a counterweight to Larry Summers, who was Obama’s top economic adviser and a White House rival for turf and power in the first two years of Obama’s Presidency. A former White House official said, “With the economic team, Valerie found it necessary to carry other voices into the White House herself. An added factor was that Elizabeth Warren is a strong woman and she and Valerie saw each other as kindred spirits.”","1734","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Jarrett helped persuade Obama to champion Warren’s new agency, but she was skeptical about Warren’s political usefulness. Warren suggested a compromise: let her spend the next year setting up the new agency, and then the President could decide whether he wanted to nominate her as its first official director. Jarrett agreed. Geithner opposed the idea, but Jarrett’s opinion prevailed with Obama, and Warren officially went to work under Geithner at Treasury to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Geithner writes that he was in favor of having Warren set up the agency, but Warren insisted to me that he opposed her. “It was a big struggle to get me in there to set it up,” she said.","1735","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The Administration’s enthusiasm for Warren continued to diminish. The Democrats lost the House to the Republicans in the 2010 midterms, and the Administration was looking for areas of compromise, not confrontation. Warren “has an oversized personality and at Treasury she ruffled a few feathers when she came on board,” a former senior White House official said.","1736","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The former White House official said, “I think in Valerie’s mind it wasn’t about Elizabeth Warren. It was about the President—where he wanted to go and what he wanted to get done. She respects people who are on the team, and that’s part of being on the team: you respect the President’s choice and you don’t try to jam him into making a decision. The Warren-for-C.F.P.B. boomlet began to look a lot more like it was about Warren than about President Obama and the goals of the Administration. And once that happens you lose Valerie.”","1737","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Fine, who saw the drama unfold, said of Warren and Jarrett, “She and Valerie had a love-hate relationship. In Valerie Jarrett’s mind, she is and always will be the queen bee. And she doesn’t want anybody else to become another force within the Administration.” Warren was diplomatic. “Valerie was enormously helpful when we were trying to get the consumer agency passed into law,” she told me. “Valerie is a friend.” When I asked if the relationship soured, she said, “I don’t think so. Valerie’s always been supportive.” In June, 2011, Obama asked Warren to come to the White House, and he informed her that she wasn’t getting the job. Fine blamed Geithner and pressure from Wall Street for the Administration’s decision. “Geithner despised her, and he’s the one who torpedoed her nomination,” Fine said. “He knew that she was a thorn in the side of his buddies up on Wall Street.” That probably overstates Geithner’s opposition. His legislative aides, who were in charge of Treasury’s relations with Congress, told him that the Senate Democratic leadership believed that Warren couldn’t win a confirmation fight, but Geithner left the decision up to Obama.","1738","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“Of course I was disappointed,” Warren told me. “I loved that work and I loved that agency.” The Warren adviser said that Warren was devastated after the meeting with Obama. “She wanted that job. She begged for it. She told the President, she told Valerie, she told them fifty times over. It was her baby. It was like taking away her child. It’s a very powerful agency, and it was her dream.”","1739","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The former senior White House official, who was involved in the decision, defended it on political grounds. “If she could have been confirmed, the President would have gone forward,” he said. “It became apparent that there was just no way the Republicans were going to do this.” He added, “She didn’t totally agree with that. She wanted to make this a fight.” In July of 2013, the Senate approved Richard Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general and state treasurer, as the new bureau’s director.","1740","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Shortly before Warren left Washington and moved back to Massachusetts, she met again with the President. “You are the very best we have,” Obama told her. “I only wish I spoke as well as you.” On her last day at the agency, the Warren adviser said, “she walked out quietly, in tears, and that was it.”","1741","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In late March, Warren stood before a crowd of small-business owners and government bureaucrats in the ballroom of the Sheraton Hotel in the Boston suburb of Framingham. She was hosting the annual “matchmaker” meeting of a program that she created to help Massachusetts businesses win more government contracts. A few days earlier, in an editorial, the Boston Globe wrote, “Democrats would be making a big mistake if they let Hillary Clinton coast to the Presidential nomination without real opposition, and, as a national leader, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren can make sure that doesn’t happen.” But few people encountering Warren for the first time at that event would have left the room taken with the idea that she was a natural candidate for President. Warren told the crowd that, when she spent her year in Washington building the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, she was frustrated that the same big companies got all the contracts. “This is all about business matchmaking,” she declared, pumping her arm. “Get out there and make some matches!”","1742","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Five minutes later, she stepped off the stage and hurried to a waiting car in front of the hotel. A few Boston reporters, eager for a comment from her about the Globe editorial, chased her out the door. Warren, who is well known in Washington for dodging the press when convenient—“She’s been known to pull out the old cell phone and pretend to be talking,” Jim Manley, Harry Reid’s former spokesman, said—sped off as reporters shouted at her. One shook her head and sighed, “I can’t believe this woman. She never answers a single question.”","1743","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren learned to be a highly disciplined politician during her 2012 Senate campaign. When Obama refused to nominate her to head the new consumer agency, his longtime adviser Pete Rouse told her that she should run for the Senate. Harry Reid also encouraged her. “Republicans were afraid of her,” he told me. “So what did they do? They said they would block her nomination. And thank goodness they did. Because after that I worked with Elizabeth and others to see if she would run against Scott Brown, who I thought was one of the worst senators in the history of my being around here. I mean, what a phony. In 2011, we worked hard to get her to run.”","1744","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren was skeptical. She wasn’t from Massachusetts and had never run for office; in January of 2010, Brown had become a hero on the right when, in a surprise victory, he was elected to finish the term of Ted Kennedy, who died in 2009. But Rouse argued that in a Presidential election year Warren would benefit from a surge of pro-Obama Democrats who hadn’t voted in the 2010 special election. More important, her reputation as the liberal conscience of the Obama Administration had created a national fund-raising network for her. She raised forty-two million dollars, becoming one of the best-funded Senate candidates in history. More than half of the money came through her Web site and more than seventy per cent from outside Massachusetts.","1745","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"But for much of the campaign Warren was down in the polls, struggling to defend previous claims of Cherokee ancestry, and she was forced to run a TV spot about the controversy. “As a kid, I never asked my mom for documentation when she talked about our Native American heritage,” she said in the ad. “What kid would? But I knew my father’s family didn’t like that she was part Cherokee and part Delaware, so my parents had to elope.” Brown suggested that she had used the claim as an affirmative-action tool to advance through the academic ranks at Penn and Harvard. Conservatives spoke of “Fauxcahontas.”","1746","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The affirmative-action claim turned out to be meritless. “It never came up here in the appointments process,” Minow, the Harvard Law School dean, told me. “I was on the faculty when she was hired. They had no idea. Nobody did. It was a nonissue. Somebody checked a box at some point to report to the federal government or whatever. But it’s nothing that the faculty ever discussed—ever.”","1747","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren spoke at the Democratic Convention that September, before Bill Clinton, who delivered a memorable defense of Obama’s record. Although Warren’s address will not go down in the pantheon of great Convention speeches, she broke through in the polls soon afterward—aided by some debate performances against Brown—and she won by almost eight points. Throughout her campaign, she said that she wouldn’t go to Washington to be a polite senator who got along with her colleagues but accomplished nothing.","1748","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"In the Senate, Warren has struggled to live up to the promises of her campaign. It’s not entirely her fault. The Senate was designed to foster long careers, and she is one of a hundred members in a body that operates under arcane rules and is hobbled by a super-majority requirement. In 2013 and 2014, she was a member of the majority, which gave her more leverage, but now—as one of the least senior members of the minority party—she has limited power and influence. I asked her how she can make a difference when she serves in a branch of government that has come to be defined by the fact that it does so little.","1749","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“Let me describe it differently,” she said. “I’m actually quite optimistic. There are a lot of tools in the toolbox.” She added that there is plenty of existing law governing how big financial institutions deal with America’s families but that government agencies don’t often use it. “One of the things that I work on as a senator is how to get the agencies to do that. And, if we can, the aircraft carrier moves one degree. Maybe two. But add that up over time, and pretty soon we’ll hit fifteen degrees.”","1750","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"She had just learned that the Department of Education would not renew a debt-collection contract for Navient, a student-loan company that she has frequently criticized. The company was alleged to have violated federal rules in the way it collected payments from young people. It often failed to disclose payment plans that were available to debtors, a practice that led to higher profits for Navient. “The world just shifted one degree,” Warren said. “It will affect, over time, millions of people if there’s better debt collection. That is, more people who can get into the right repayment program, who can continue to repay, more people who will get the debt forgiveness that’s available to them as a matter of law. This isn’t charity. This is what the law says.” She added, “The playing field just got one degree more level. And that is good.”","1751","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Sometimes Warren is compared to super-partisans like Ted Cruz, one of the most outspoken and conservative Republicans in the Senate. Her aides and some Democratic senators object to the analogy, seeing Cruz and his colleagues as undisciplined conservative activists who insert themselves into every public fight. “He’s a pain in the ass to his own Republicans,” Reid said. “She’s not.” Warren sees herself as more selective in her battles, which can be an asset. “The people who are the most effective senators are the people who, if I said their names, you could tell me two or three things they really care about,” former Senator Christopher Dodd said. I recently watched Warren speak at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Iran sanctions. During most hearing appearances, she launches into a soliloquy or berates a witness. She holds typed notes and can be seen nervously lip-synching as she prepares for her moment on camera.","1752","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"But at the sanctions hearings Warren made a short opening statement saying she believed that negotiations with Iran are the best option to prevent war, then explained that she wanted to hear the witnesses to understand if any new sanctions would help or hurt that process.

"Warren’s two biggest confrontations have been over Obama nominees whom she saw as too oriented toward Wall Street. While she was setting up the new consumer agency, Warren learned how the decision-making process works for high-profile nominees, and she knew from her own experience that, if Congress creates enough of a problem for a nominee, Obama will abandon him or her. Warren’s advisers believe that Obama has a low tolerance for political pain. Critics accuse Warren of grandstanding, but her aides insist that she is simply trying to influence decision-making.","1754","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The first Obama nominee she helped scuttle was Larry Summers, whom Obama considered nominating as Fed chairman. She collaborated with her old friend Camden Fine. “She and I worked pretty closely together to torpedo Larry Summers,” Fine said, recalling a secret campaign they undertook. In the spring of 2013, Fine told the Administration that his organization was going to publicly oppose Summers as chairman. It would have been the first time in the group’s nearly hundred-year history that it took a position on a Fed chairman. Fine couldn’t believe that Obama was going to pass up the opportunity to nominate Janet Yellen, who would be the first female chair of the Fed. He e-mailed Warren with the question “Really?” Warren e-mailed back and said she felt the same way. “She was also communicating with the White House and telling them that she wasn’t happy,” he said.","1755","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"That summer, Rouse called Warren and asked her to soften her rhetoric against Summers, promising her that Obama would consult with her before he made any decision. “She backed off a little bit,” the former senior White House official said. “Not in her opposition to Summers but in her public aggressiveness in opposing him.”","1756","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"“She can be in your face on an issue,” Reid said, recounting some of the battles in which she opposed the Administration. “But you don’t realize it at the time.

"Fine worked on moderate and conservative Senate Democrats, such as Jon Tester, of Montana, while Warren lobbied liberals. When enough of the senators came out publicly against Summers, Obama gave up. “Warren got a couple of the progressive senators to oppose Summers,” Fine said, “and then I got a couple of the conservative Democratic senators, including Tester, to come out.” Senator Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, who led the effort in support of Yellen, told me, “Senator Tester’s public statement seemed to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.”","1758","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Late last year, Warren seized on a Treasury Department nominee named Antonio Weiss, a former managing director at Lazard, where he had worked on so-called inversions, the practice by which a U.S. company moves its headquarters to an overseas location in order to lower its tax exposure. (In 2005, Lazard moved its headquarters to Bermuda.) Although the Administration has publicly opposed inversions, Obama picked Weiss to be Under-Secretary for Domestic Finance, a top position at Treasury. Warren orchestrated a campaign against him. Outside liberal groups that had championed her during her Senate race started a petition against Weiss, while she used outlets like the Huffington Post to criticize him. Inside the Senate, she quietly lobbied the liberals again, and one by one they started to come out against him.","1759","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"The former senior White House official said that he was “disappointed and surprised” by the opposition, because Warren began her public campaign just weeks after Democrats lost the Senate to the Republicans in the midterm elections. “The President had just gotten killed in the election, and this is one of his first appointments,” he said. “I don’t object to her opposing Antonio Weiss, but I would have liked to see her at least wait a little bit, give the President a little bit of space, maybe meet with the guy before she came out and attacked him and said he’s unqualified because he worked on Wall Street. But that’s consistent with her brand, and it worked for her.”","1760","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Camden Fine was skittish about taking a position on Weiss, but he eventually promised Warren, “If you go public, we’ll go public.” Weiss withdrew his name, and the Administration made him a Treasury adviser instead, which doesn’t require Senate confirmation.","1761","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"

"Clinton’s advisers are respectful of Warren, but they privately argue that Clinton has a more sophisticated understanding of the economy, and that Warren places too much blame on Wall Street as the root of America’s economic problems. “The challenge of wage stagnation is that it’s happening in large swaths of the economy, many parts of which are relatively untouched by the influence of the banks,” a longtime Clinton adviser said. “There is a legitimate line of economic thought that countries without as large a financial sector as the U.S. have less inequality, but Goldman Sachs doesn’t really have much to do with the rise of Uber and TaskRabbit.”","1764","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren took exception to the Clinton camp’s critique. “I think it’s important to hold Wall Street accountable,” she told me. “Some of the biggest financial institutions in this country developed a business model around cheating American families, and they put out the riskiest possible products. They sold mortgages that were like grenades with the pins pulled out, and then they packaged up those risks and sold them to pension plans and municipal governments, groups that did not intend to buy high-risk financial products. That’s how Wall Street blew up the American economy. That’s a genuine threat, and that’s worth paying attention to.”","1765","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"This isn’t the first time that a Democratic candidate has had to manage an emboldened left. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama pilloried free-trade agreements before becoming President, then shepherded such agreements through Congress. That’s the nature of Presidential campaigns.

"Harry Reid, a major Clinton supporter who said he was “happy” that Warren has decided not to run for President, told me that he ultimately sees Warren not as Clinton’s rival but as her emissary to the left. “Hillary Clinton will have her come where she’s needed,” he said. “No one is more forceful and more articulate on issues with the progressive community.”","1767","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"
"Warren insists that she can have more influence as a senator than by running against Clinton in the primaries. “I think right now I’m using the best tools to make change,” she told me. When she got into politics, she said, “first, it was for my own family and my children, then a little bit bigger, for my brothers and to take care of my mom and dad, and then my students, and then my work about what’s happening to families just like mine all over this country. I’m still working on exactly the same things, and I’m working on the best possible way to make change.”","1768","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"

"Fine offered another explanation for her hesitation. “I’m not sure she thinks that she, personally, is ready to be the President of the United States,” he told me. I asked Warren if Fine was right. She was rushing to a meeting at the end of a busy day in the Senate. For the first time since I began speaking to her, four months ago, she seemed tongue-tied.","1770","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate"

"In recent years, it’s become a commonplace that American companies are too obsessed with the short term. In the heyday of Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the argument goes, corporations had long time horizons and invested heavily in the future. But now investors care only about quarterly earnings and short-term stock prices, so companies skimp on R. & D. and waste hundreds of billions propping up their stock with share buybacks. This “tyranny of accountants” has damaged both the long-term prospects of companies and the U.S. economy as a whole.","1772","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/the-short-termism-myth"
"The latest public figure to embrace this diagnosis is Hillary Clinton. In a speech a couple of weeks ago, she unveiled a solution: changing the capital-gains tax in order to encourage investors to hold stocks longer. Right now, there are only two capital-gains categories: anything held for less than a year is short-term; anything longer is long-term. Clinton’s plan, which would apply only to investors in the highest tax bracket, would expand the definition of short-term to include any investment held for less than two years, and it would create a sliding scale of rates. For every extra year (up to six) that you keep a stock, you pay a lower rate.","1773","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/the-short-termism-myth"
"The political appeal of the plan is clear. It targets wealthy investors, is friendly to executives, and is aimed at getting companies to spend more money. Unfortunately, it almost certainly won’t work. The simplest reason for this is that the plan would affect only a small slice of the market. Len Burman, a tax expert at the Urban Institute, told me, “The plan’s unlikely to have a major impact on stock prices, since most of the money in the market is controlled by institutions that don’t pay capital-gains taxes, like endowments and pension funds.” Burman also made the point that pushing people to hold stocks they would rather sell is hardly conducive to productive investment. “Even if short-termism is the problem, locking people into unprofitable transactions for long periods of time doesn’t really seem like a great solution,” he said.","1774","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/the-short-termism-myth"
"Aside from these practical problems, the plan rests on two common but ultimately questionable assumptions. The first is that corporate decision-makers care only about the short term. The second is that it’s the stock market that makes them think this way. These assumptions are widely shared and long-standing, in both business and academe. A famous report from the Council on Competitiveness in the early nineties concluded that, compared with Germany and Japan, the U.S. was greatly underinvesting in the future. In 2005, the C.E.O. of Xerox, Anne Mulcahy, described the pressure from Wall Street for short-term profits as “a huge problem,” and, in a survey of executives that same year, more than half said they would delay valuable new projects in order to boost short-term earnings.","1775","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/the-short-termism-myth"
"That sounds pretty bad. Yet when you actually look at the numbers the story gets more complicated. There is reason to think that some companies are investing too little in the future. As a whole, though, corporate spending on R. & D. has risen steadily over the years, and has stayed relatively constant as a share of G.D.P. and as a share of sales. This year, R. & D. spending is accelerating at its fastest pace in fifty years and is at an all-time high as a percentage of G.D.P. Furthermore, U.S. companies don’t spend notably less on R. & D. than their international competitors. Similarly with investors: their alleged obsession with short-term earnings is hard to see in the data. Several studies in the nineties found that companies announcing major R. & D. investments were rewarded by the markets, not punished, and that companies with more institutional investors (who typically have shorter time horizons) spent more on R. & D., not less. A 2011 Deutsche Bank study of more than a thousand companies found that those which spent significantly more on R. & D. than their competitors were more highly valued by investors. And a 2014 study of companies that cut R. & D. spending in order to meet short-term earnings goals found that their stocks underperformed after earnings had been announced—hardly what you’d expect if the market cared only about the short term.","1776","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/the-short-termism-myth"
"Of course, there’s no shortage of investors who are myopic. But the market, for the most part, isn’t. That’s why companies like Amazon and Tesla and Netflix, whose profits in the present have typically been a tiny fraction of their market caps, have been able to command colossal valuations. It’s why there’s a steady flow of I.P.O.s for companies with small revenues and nonexistent earnings. And it’s why the biotech industry is now valued at more than a trillion dollars, even though many of the firms have yet to bring a single drug to market. None of these things are what you’d expect from a market dominated by short-term considerations.","1777","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/the-short-termism-myth"
"To the extent that companies are underinvesting in the future, the blame lies not with investors but with executives. The pay of many C.E.O.s is tied to factors like short-term earnings, rather than to longer-term metrics, which naturally fosters myopia. That 2014 study of companies that cut R. & D. spending found that the executives responsible saw their pay rise sharply, even though the stock didn’t. If Clinton really wants to deal with short-termism, she’d be better off targeting the way executive compensation works, instead of the way capital gains are taxed. Ultimately, the solution to short-termism isn’t on Wall Street. It’s in the executive suite. ♦","1778","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/the-short-termism-myth"

"If you’re following the 2016 Presidential campaign closely (and, at this early stage, I’m not suggesting that’s necessary), you’ll find an interesting subplot. While much of the media is focussing on the rise of Donald Trump and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders, the two pre-race favorites, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, are continuing to focus on each other. At the start of this week, the Clinton campaign put out a video highlighting what it said were Bush’s “extreme ideas about immigration” and claiming that he was following Trump’s lead. On Thursday, the Bush campaign released a video highlighting Clinton’s e-mail travails and promoting Bush’s upcoming e-book, ”Reply All,” which will contain some of the e-mail exchanges he had when he was the governor of Florida.","August 27, 2015","1780","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"It’s pretty clear what’s going on here. The seasoned operatives running both campaigns are operating on the assumption that, six or seven months from now, Jeb and Hillary will both be on their way to securing the nominations of their respective parties, after which they will face each other in a general election. The Trump tornado will have blown itself out. Sanders will have maxed out his support among progressive Democrats. Order will have been restored, and it will be Bush versus Clinton, after all.","1781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"On the Democratic side, arguably, this strategy of playing a long game makes sense. Clinton, despite recent slippages—notably in New Hampshire, where two successive surveys have shown Sanders ahead of her—retains a big lead in the national polls. For example, a Quinnipiac University survey of likely Democratic voters released on Thursday showed Clinton at forty-five per cent and Sanders at twenty-two per cent.","1782","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As my colleague Ryan Lizza pointed out in a post arguing that Vice-President Joe Biden can’t win the nomination, Clinton also has the support of a majority of elected Democrats, which, in the past, has been a good predictor of success. I’m a bit less convinced than Ryan that a Biden campaign would be a no-hoper. In the Quinnipiac poll, he came in third, at eighteen per cent—not bad for someone who isn’t even a candidate yet. But there is no doubt that, right now, Clinton is the strong favorite. Most British bookmakers, where people wager real money on these things, have the odds of her getting the nomination at one to three or one to four. This implies that bettors put the probability that Clinton will prevail at seventy-five or eighty per cent.","1783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Bush’s campaign, on the other hand, appears to be in free fall. His poll numbers are tanking, his message is blurred, his verbal stumbles are multiplying, and his money men are reportedly getting nervous. In the betting market, he remains the favorite to get the G.O.P. nomination, but at some of the sites his odds have slipped to seven to four, which implies that the probability of his winning is about a third. Rather than worrying about Clinton, Bush and his strategists desperately need to find a way for him to counter his Republican rivals—not just Trump, whose whirlwind campaign would be difficult for any regular politician to deal with, but Marco Rubio, John Kasich, and Carly Fiorina, any of whom could conceivably end up supplanting him as the moderate conservative candidate. (I use “moderate” in a relative sense. All of the G.O.P. candidates, Bush included, are solidly on the right.)","1784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Until Memorial Day, when Trump wasn’t yet in the race, Bush was polling in the mid-teens—enough to keep him in or close to the lead. The new Quinnipiac poll has him at seven per cent, sharing third place with Rubio and Cruz. That’s just one survey, of course, but the Real Clear Politics poll average also shows him dropping into single figures, at 9.8 per cent. And it’s not just the national polls that are bringing bad tidings. In Iowa, Bush is tied, with Rubio, for sixth place—yes, sixth—behind Trump, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, and Fiorina. In New Hampshire, he is in third place: Kasich, who is making a big effort there, has moved ahead of him (with both of them well behind Trump). In South Carolina, too, Bush is in third place, behind Trump and Carson. Based on these numbers, it appears that he could fail to win any of the first three primaries, leaving him acutely vulnerable going into the Nevada caucus and Super Tuesday.","1785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Of course, these numbers will change over the next few months. But they are unlikely to move in Bush’s favor unless he hones his message and stops tripping over himself. What does he stand for? Going into the campaign, it seemed pretty straightforward: competence, conservative economics, and a shift toward the center on immigration and other social issues. But in none of these areas has he really delivered. His verbal clangers have made him look like a gentleman amateur, rather than a seasoned politician capable of taking down a Clinton or a Biden. Beyond some sunny rhetoric about boosting the G.D.P. growth rate to four per cent a year, his economic plan remains largely undefined.","1786","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Perhaps most alarming of all, Bush seems unsure whether he truly represents a break with the xenophobic, homophobic, modernity-loathing wing of the Republican Party. He has allowed Kasich, in particular, to position himself as a plausible, electable alternative. (One telling example: while Bush is running away from the Common Core education standards, which he previously backed, and which many conservative Republican activists hate, Kasich is still supporting them.)","1787","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"Meanwhile, the gaffes keep coming. Every week, it seems, Bush or a member of his staff has to try to walk back one of his public comments. Most recently, he suggested, after using the term “anchor babies,” that he was referring not to children born in the United States to Hispanic parents but to those born to Asian parents. That hop from the frying pan into the fire allowed Trump, of all people, to accuse him of being offensive. And it’s not merely that Bush appears to have inherited the family weakness for malapropisms. He seems incapable of saying anything snappy or memorable. With Trump regularly tearing him to shreds in interviews and on Twitter, the best he can manage in response are statements like “Mr. Trump doesn’t have a proven conservative record.”","1788","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"
"As long as Trump’s campaign seemed likely to fade quickly, staying above the fray was a defensible strategy. It jibed with the old edict “Never wrestle with a pig. You get dirty and, besides, the pig likes it.” But things have moved on, and it’s clear that Trump isn’t going away anytime soon. Moreover, Trump is a typical bully, and so, as long as he senses weakness on Bush’s part, he will continue to torment him with comments like “Jeb Bush is a low-energy person,” or, as he put it in Alabama last weekend, “a very, very low-energy person.”","1789","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trials-of-jeb-bush"

"On Thursday, while the political world was focussed on the Supreme Court’s Obamacare ruling, two polls came out showing Bernie Sanders making up ground on Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and Iowa. In a survey carried out by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center for CNN and the Manchester-based WMUR TV, Clinton was leading Sanders by just eight percentage points: forty-three per cent to thirty-five per cent. Meanwhile, a poll carried out in Iowa for Bloomberg found that Sanders now has the support of about a quarter of likely Democratic voters, by far his strongest showing yet in the state that will be the first to vote in the Democratic primary. “It’s tremendous progress that he is making with voters in the first two states,” Tad Devine, Sanders’s chief political strategist, told Bloomberg’s John McCormick. “It’s something we felt on the ground.”","June 26, 2015","1792","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"At this stage, it’s necessary to issue a few qualifiers.","1793","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"First, it’s not July 4th yet, and there are still seven months until the 2016 primaries begin. At this early stage, opinion polls bounce around quite a bit, and no single survey should be accorded very much weight. Second, Clinton is trouncing Sanders in the national polls. Third, even in the early primary states she still has a big advantage. In Iowa, Sanders has yet to come within twenty-five points of her in any poll, and in New Hampshire a separate Bloomberg survey found that she retains a much bigger lead than the CNN/WMUR survey suggested: twenty-six points. “Clinton remains enormously well-known and well-liked in New Hampshire, a state she won before,” Doug Usher, of Purple Strategies, the research firm that carried out Bloomberg’s New Hampshire poll, said. “She benefits from a gender gap in a primary that will be disproportionately female, and even Sanders’s voters admit Clinton is likely the nominee.”","1794","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"So there’s no need for panic in the Clinton camp, which has adopted the public position that it expected a competitive primary all along. But for Sanders, and for Democrats who would like an alternative to Clinton, the signs are encouraging. The seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator is clearly enjoying himself, hurtling around the country, drawing large crowds, and promoting his progressive agenda. In the past few days, for instance, he has welcomed Pope Francis’s encyclical on climate change, criticized Congress for granting President Obama fast-track authority to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and reiterated his call to expand Medicare into a national health-care system for everyone.","1795","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"As Sanders promised when he started out, he isn’t criticizing Clinton directly. But he is seeking to draw a contrast between his clear positions on such issues as trade with his opponent’s nuanced statements. And he’s insisting he’s in it to win. Speaking to David Corn, of Mother Jones, Devine explained that Sanders’s strategy is based on raising enough money—forty or fifty million dollars—to advertise in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, and he claimed that, thanks to lots of small donations, this strategy is working so far. “I don’t know if we can outright beat her in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Devine said, “but we have a real shot at it in both places.”","1796","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"That may be stretching things. Still, if Sanders keeps gaining, he will certainly have the capacity to disrupt some of the Clinton campaign’s carefully laid plans. Should they go after Bernie? Should they ignore him? Something in the middle? Up until now, the Clintonites have been running a professional and highly scripted operation that has achieved most of its initial goals, but that sometimes resembles painting by numbers. Clinton has the money, the infrastructure, and the support from other prominent Democrats that Sanders lacks, but the Vermont senator has advantages, too: enthusiasm at the grassroots, the flexibility that comes with being a one-man band, and the ability to position himself as a scrappy underdog and outsider.","1797","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"“You can make the case that a certain amount of Bernie Sanders’s support is a protest vote, but there’s more to it than that,” J. Ann Selzer, the president of Selzer & Co, which carried out Bloomberg’s poll in Iowa, said. “People like him. They like what he stands for. They like showing up at his events and hearing him say things they believe in.” In short, Sanders is running a classic insurgency campaign. And as many establishment candidates have discovered in the past, running against such an opponent can be an uncomfortable experience.","1798","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge"
"For observers of Joe Biden—and anyone who wonders whether he will challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Presidential nomination—there was a small, telling moment in April, 2014, during a routine interview with “CBS This Morning.” Vice-President Biden and President Barack Obama were side by side when the reporter, Major Garrett, asked about the 2016 race. Biden gave the ritual denials (“If I decide to run, this is the first guy I’d talk to, but that decision hasn’t been made”) before Obama lavished praise upon him as “a great partner in everything I do.” Then Obama began to talk about someone else: “I suspect that there may be other potential candidates for 2016 who have been great friends and allies. We’ve got an extraordinary Secretary of State who did great service for us, for me and Joe.” Biden looked away, then back to the President, with a strained smile.

Some of Biden’s advisers have been contacting uncommitted Democratic donors, seeking to test their ability to marshal a campaign in a hurry, to measure Clinton’s vulnerability, and to see whether Biden might tap the evident desire for a non-Clinton option, which has fuelled the surprising early success of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.","1800","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"Reaction to the Biden prospect has been polite but practical. My colleague Ryan Lizza asked where Biden’s advantage over Clinton was in various areas—youth, gender, broad party support, “lefty cred,” money, and campaign strength—and found none. There was a time when Biden (who is almost five years older than Clinton) thought he had an angle, at least on lefty cred. Early last year, he began to stake out a populist economic appeal, telling a United Auto Workers audience, “You guys are the only guys keeping the barbarians at the gates, man.” He warned that conservatives have launched “a concerted, full-throated, well-organized, well-financed, well-thought-out effort waging war on labor’s house.” Since then, Sanders has staked out that territory, leaving Biden less room to maneuver.","1801","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"But another factor that, for the moment, weighs against a Biden run has more to do with his chemistry than with his competition. While reporting a Profile last year, I heard him return over and over to matters of respect. His father, Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr., was a car salesman who quit a stable job because his boss was imperious. One of Biden’s old-world, Scranton sensibilities is that he never forgets who afforded him respect and who withheld it; he still talks about the grade-school students who humiliated him for a childhood stutter, and his aides learn quickly that Biden hates nothing more than embarrassment. A former adviser recalled prepping Biden to ask a European leader for a favor; when the leader unexpectedly said no, Biden froze: “He hangs up the phone, and he’s like, ‘Don’t ever set me up like that again. It’s O.K. if we can’t move the ball; I’ll still make the call, but you’ve got to tell me.’”","1802","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"As a candidate, Biden would have to contend, once again, with the plagiarism scandal that drove him out of the 1988 race, and, given the choice between spending the next year as a trusted Vice-President or a third-time candidate trailing Hillary Clinton, Biden would likely be reluctant to subject himself to it. Then again, if that changes—if Clinton’s favorability drops sharply, or if she looks wounded, don’t expect Biden to defer to her (or to Bernie).","1803","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"If Biden doesn’t run, his greatest assist to his party will be if he can help Clinton find a way to leverage his most enduring asset: his willingness to express the kind of authentic emotion that is rare in American politics. It is a cliché to note that Clinton’s strongest moment as a candidate came in 2007, when she choked up before voters in New Hampshire, but it’s still true. Biden generates that kind of connection with people more frequently—often outside of public view. In “Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland,” two women who were kidnapped by the school-bus driver Ariel Castro and later escaped recalled meeting Biden at the White House. Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus thought that they were there for a quick grip-and-grin. He sat with them for forty-five minutes, and then invited them to lunch—while he pushed off other meetings and told them about the car accident, in 1972, that killed his wife and daughter. In their memoir, written with the journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, Berry recalled the encounter:","1804","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"In his speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, he said, “Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.” In the end, the only trait in Bidenworld that matters nearly as much as respect is perseverance.","1805","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/joe-bidens-respect-calculation"
"In December of last year, I quoted a statement Bernie Sanders made as he launched his “Economic Agenda for America,” a twelve-point plan designed to tackle wage stagnation and promote high-paying jobs. “We have a corporate establishment whose greed is destroying the economy, a political establishment which is beholden to billionaires, and a media establishment which largely ignores the major issues facing working families,” he said. “We need a political revolution.”","August 15, 2015","1806","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"At the time, the seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator was mulling a Presidential bid, but few commentators or Democratic voters were paying much attention to him. Now, of course, his standing in the political world is very different, but his language isn’t. “We have a message to the billionaire class, and that message is you can’t have it all,” he told a crowd, estimated at more than twenty-five thousand, in Los Angeles earlier this week. “You can’t get huge tax breaks when children in our country are going hungry. . . . You cannot continue to hide billions in profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. Corporate America and the billionaire class are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.”","1807","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Sanders has long been consistent in his views. For many years, he has been about the only politician on Capitol Hill who openly described himself as a socialist. What has changed is the American political environment. After Elizabeth Warren declined to enter the 2016 race, Sanders, by virtue of his leftist views, his energy, and his willingness to challenge Hillary Clinton, inherited Warren’s position as the tribune of a reinvigorated progressive movement.","1808","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Anyone who wondered how far this movement could carry Sanders now has an answer of sorts. It’s not just that he’s drawing much bigger crowds than any other candidate in either party. This week, a poll carried out by Franklin Pierce University for the Boston Herald showed him leading Clinton in New Hampshire, by forty-four per cent to thirty-seven per cent among likely Democratic voters. While this seven-point lead only slightly exceeded the poll’s margin of error, it represented a huge turnaround from a poll taken in March by the same organization, which gave Sanders just eight per cent of the potential Democratic vote, compared with forty-seven per cent for Clinton.","1809","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"In Iowa, too, Sanders seems be making up ground. As recently as Memorial Day, he was trailing Clinton by about fifty points in the Hawkeye State, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. Now Clinton’s lead has been cut in half, and one poll this week, from CNN, showed Sanders getting within twenty points of her. That’s still a comfortable margin, but the trend is in the underdog’s favor.","1810","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Based on the current polling, Sanders’s summer surge has left him with a realistic chance of winning one of the first two primary states, and of scaring the favorite in the other. For an insurgent candidate whom some political observers are still dismissing as a no-hoper, these are considerable achievements.","1811","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"And, of course, Sanders’s contribution can’t be measured solely in polling numbers. In lambasting tax-dodging corporate élites and highlighting the corrosive effect that money is having on U.S. politics, he is telling truths that need to be told and giving voice to the feelings of many Americans, particularly young Americans, who feel alienated by the current system. Not only that: with Sanders leading the way, progressives are pushing the rest of the Democratic Party to the left, which could have a lasting impact on policy should the Democrats go on to retain the White House.","1812","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Sanders, however, insists that he’s not running merely to cheer up progressive activists or to be a thorn in the side of the Clinton political machine. He insists he’s in it to win, which means he needs to move beyond his base of white, college-educated liberals and start picking up votes from other elements of the party coalition, such as non-whites, women, and Southern Democrats, all of whom still slant heavily toward Clinton.","1813","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"Indeed, one of the most surprising things about Sanders’s rise is how little impact it appears to be having on Clinton’s base. So far, Sanders has done an excellent job of enthusing and mobilizing Democrats and independents who had serious doubts about a Clinton restoration to begin with, particularly those living on the East Coast and West Coast. Hillary’s large core of Democratic support remains largely in place, however.","1814","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"You can see this is in the national polls, which show her retaining a huge advantage over Sanders. The last six national polls showed Clinton leading him by thirty-seven percentage points (Ipsos/Reuters and Morning Consult), thirty-five points (another Ipsos/Reuters survey), thirty-three points (Zogby), thirty points (YouGov/The Economist), and twenty-nine points (Fox News). As of Saturday morning, the Huffington Post’s poll average, which combines these and other surveys, showed Clinton at 53.7 per cent, Sanders at 18.2 per cent, and Joe Biden (who isn’t officially a candidate) at 11.9 per cent.","1815","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"While the former Secretary of State’s popularity among the electorate at large has fallen recently, the vast majority of Democrats still think positively of her, surveys suggest. For example, a Monmouth University poll published last week showed that seventy-six per cent of self-identified Democrats have a favorable opinion of Clinton; the latest CBS News poll put her favorability rating among Democratic primary voters at eighty-two per cent. In the same polls, among the same groups, Sanders’s favorability ratings were thirty-nine per cent and thirty-seven per cent.","1816","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"These look like the numbers of a protest candidate rather than one capable of putting together a broad coalition of supporters, which is what you need to win the Democratic primary. A Gallup poll published this week showed that just twenty-three per cent of African-Americans have a favorable opinion of Sanders, and just thirty-three per cent of African-Americans are even familiar with him. (Clinton’s numbers on these two questions were eighty per cent and ninety-two per cent, respectively.) A prior Gallup survey found that Sanders was also on the wrong side of a big gender gap. Among men who self-identify as Democrats and “Democratic leaners,” his favorability rating was forty-seven per cent; among women who self-identify in the same way, his favorability rating was just thirty-two per cent.","1817","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"If these numbers don’t change, Sanders will struggle mightily once the first two primaries are out of the way and attention switches to places like South Carolina, Nevada, and the twelve states—eight of them in the South—that will vote on “Super Tuesday,” March 1st. That likelihood explains why many commentators believe the best he can do is to serve as a stalking horse for an established Democrat with broader appeal, much as Eugene McCarthy did, in 1968, when his strong showing in New Hampshire prompted Robert Kennedy to enter the race.","1818","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"While the primary calendar invites such historical analogies, they are, at this stage, pure speculation. Sanders, well aware of his current position, is reaching out to African-Americans and other groups. After protesters from the “Black Lives Matter” movement disrupted some of his rallies, he hired a black twenty-five-year-old activist, Symone Sanders (no relation), as his national press secretary. He also announced a “Racial Justice” platform that called for the elimination of minimum-sentence guidelines, the demilitarization of urban police forces, a ban on private prisons, and a “ban the box” law designed to prevent employers from discriminating against job candidates with minor criminal records. Next week, Sanders is heading back to South Carolina, where he will hold rallies in four cities, including Charleston.","1819","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"
"In trying to move beyond his white liberal base, Sanders faces a huge challenge, but it would be folly to underestimate him. Thanks to the groundswell of support among progressive activists, young Democrats, and small donors, he has the money, the manpower, and the social-media presence to expand his footprint. And, with televised Democratic debates starting in the fall,* he will have the opportunity to introduce himself to a broader audience. Based on what we’ve seen so far, it seems likely that more potential Democratic voters will warm to his message.","1820","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanderss-next-challenge"

"The Times report that Vice-President Joe Biden is seriously considering entering the 2016 Presidential race isn’t exactly news. He’s been mulling such a move for at least a couple of years. “It’s as likely I run as I don’t run,” Biden said on the talk show “The View” in February, 2014. In an interview with Politico’s Glenn Thrush that month, he laid out the sort of campaign he could conduct, focussing on rising inequality and the wage squeeze. “It’s either going to be me or someone else who is going to make this argument in the Democratic Party.” As I wrote at the time, “He’s still full of energy, he’s served President Obama loyally, he loves the game, and he thinks—pundits and pollsters be damned—that this might be the moment for an old-school, shit-kicking, hand-grasping, mouth-running, stick-up-for-the-working-stiff pol like himself.”","August 3, 2015","1823","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"During the year and a half after those stories appeared, Hillary Clinton cemented her position as a prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination, and most pundits assumed Biden was out. That was premature. In January of this year, he told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that he still hadn’t made up his mind, noting, “There’s plenty of time.” Now, however, the clock is ticking. In recent weeks, as Amy Chozick, of the Times, reported on Saturday, some of Biden’s aides have been meeting with potential donors and campaign staffers who have not yet committed to Clinton. The report said that confidants of Biden expect him to make a final decision one way or the other by early September.","1824","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Two things appear to have prompted Biden to get serious. The first was the death, in May, of his forty-six-year-old son Beau, who had urged his father to take a third and final tilt at the Presidency. (Biden’s previous campaigns were in 1988 and 2008.) The other factor was the growing perception among political professionals that Clinton could be vulnerable in a general election, which is partly based on polling data showing that many voters distrust her. “The No. 1 thing voters want is a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, and the veep is leading in those polls,” William Pierce, the executive director of the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC, told Chozick.","1825","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"The poll that Pierce was referring to was carried out by Quinnipiac University and released late last week. It found that just thirty-seven per cent of likely voters find Clinton “honest and trustworthy,” and that fifty-seven per cent don’t. For Biden, the figures were reversed. Fifty-eight per cent of the respondents said that they found him honest and trustworthy; thirty-four per cent said they didn’t. The Vice-President also led the former Secretary of State on the issue of empathy. Asked whether he “cares about the needs and problems of people like you or not,” fifty-seven per cent said yes, and thirty-five per cent said no. When the pollsters asked the same question about Clinton, forty-five per cent of people said yes, and fifty-two per cent said no.","1826","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"This was just one poll, and its results didn’t all come out in Biden’s favor. Fifty-eight per cent of respondents said that Clinton had “strong leadership qualities,” compared to fifty-two per cent for Biden. Still, the survey found that in head-to-head contests with the Republican candidates, Biden did at least as well as Clinton. In a matchup with Jeb Bush, Clinton trailed by one percentage point, and Biden led by one point; in a matchup with Donald Trump, they both led by twelve percentage points.","1827","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"If these figures are taken at face value, they suggest that Biden could be a viable candidate in the general election. But in order to get there, he would have to overcome Clinton’s enormous lead in money, organization, and electoral support. The Clinton campaign has already raised well over fifty million dollars, and it is aiming to raise a hundred million by the end of the year. (That doesn’t count all the money that will be raised by super PACs and other organizations allied with Hillary.) Clinton already has big political operations in the early voting states. And, according to the Huffington Post’s poll average, she is leading Bernie Sanders by 56.9 per cent to 18.9 per cent among likely Democratic voters.","1828","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Although he’s not currently a candidate, Biden is in third place, with twelve per cent of the vote. If he were to enter the race, that figure would almost certainly rise, at least for a while. But he would still be a long-shot candidate. Positioning himself to the left of Clinton, he would be competing with Bernie Sanders for the votes of progressive Democrats, some of whom wouldn’t welcome his late entry. He would also need to pick up support from moderates who have doubts about the Clintons.","1829","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"At seventy-two, Biden potentially faces an age issue. (Clinton is five years his junior; Sanders is a year older.) A bigger challenge, however, might be demonstrating that he has what it takes to be President. Despite his long history as a senator and Vice-President, many members of the political and media establishment have long seen him as lacking the necessary gravitas and depth for the highest office. Doubts about Biden’s seriousness date back to his 1988 Presidential bid, which was derailed by allegations that he had exaggerated his college record and plagiarized part of a speech.","1830","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Nineteen eighty-eight is a long time ago, and Biden has achieved a lot since then, including serving as Vice-President for the past six and a half years. An eminently decent and likable man, he has never had the stench of corruption that attaches itself to many people who stay in Washington for a long time. About the worst that you hear said about him is that he is a blowhard who occasionally blurts out embarrassing things.","1831","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"In an era of scripted politicians and carefully orchestrated campaigns, some Democrats may see Biden’s spontaneity as a plus. And the issues of the moment play to his strengths. As long ago as 1988, he was talking about increasing social mobility, defending the middle class, and challenging the notion that you can’t buck the market. “For too long in this society, we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community,” he said in his first announcement speech. “For too long as a nation, we have been lulled by the anthem of self-interest. . . . We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference.”","1832","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/joe-bidens-big-decision"
"Back then, Biden was a youngish Roman Catholic pol on the up, and, doubtless, the echoes of John F. Kennedy in his speech were deliberate. Today, he is older and more grizzled (as are many of the rest of us). Taking on the Clintons and the Republicans is a task that would give anyone pause, let alone a seventy-two-year-old who has just lost his son.

"How many Republicans are running for President? It’s a trick question. Some of those who are clearly running—Jeb Bush, for example—are still pretending that they aren’t, mostly because declaring would change the fund-raising rules. And if you counted everyone who, against all evidence, takes himself (or herself) seriously as a candidate, the locker room depicted in Mark Ulriksen’s “Suiting Up,” this week’s cover, would look as crowded as the departures hall at Penn Station, and almost as disconcerting. As it is, Ulriksen presents seven contenders with seven varieties of preening. Maybe it’s hard to tell a vision for America from a delusion of grandeur, at least until the debates and primaries get under way. Until then, Marco Rubio’s got his phone, Rand Paul his comb, and Huckabee his Bible. Ted Cruz’s eyes flit between his copy of the Constitution and his mirror, while Scott Walker seems on the lookout for unionized gym attendants. Bush is wearing his dynasty-logo boxers and Chris Christie his put-me-in-now pout. And yet, somehow, one of these seven men is almost certainly right about his chances for the nomination.

By the next summer, though, Giuliani had dropped out of the race (his health and personal life got pretty complicated).

"The oddest thing about the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking Democratic nomination for President, is not his distaste for fund-raising, his insistence that he is a “democratic Socialist,” or even his unofficial slogan, “Feel the Bern,” a phrase that vividly recalls Jane Fonda at the moment of her disentanglement from the New Left. It is his popularity with kids. Since tossing his worn cap into the ring, in April, Sanders has racked up a disproportionate share of the youth vote: thirty-seven per cent of voters twenty-nine or younger, compared with Hillary Clinton’s forty per cent, in one poll. Why? Outwardly, he does not seem like a particularly hip or youthful guy. Sanders is nearly seventy-four, dresses like Willy Loman, and can name, from direct memory, the Dodgers’ lineup in the year 1951. When he shows up at events, his fleecy hair, or what remains of it, looks ravaged, as if he had puttered all the way there in a drop-top Model T. He wears a watch; it’s not by Apple. And yet, today, Sanders boasts a larger Facebook following than Clinton and Jeb Bush combined.","August 25, 2015","1838","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"It’s on Facebook that Sanders fandom, and a language associated with it, has flourished. Followers post about the way he “slayed” in this or that speech, how he seems “so logical” compared with other politicians, how he motivated them to vote, for the first time, in their late twenties. As Sanders, an independent, throttled into a strong second place for the Democratic nomination, Bern-ers on Twitter praised him as “clever” and “trustworthy.” In the magazine last week, Daniel Wenger reported on an eighteen-year-old kid’s attempt to organize a Sanders YouTube viewing party in his parents’ living room. On Friday, in a greater coup, Sanders received the endorsement of the fifteen-year-old prank candidate Deez Nuts, who made a splash in some Midwestern polls earlier this month, and who cited his frank and accessible style. Queried about Sanders’s leading opponent in the race, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Nuts simply asked, “Why can’t you be more open and friendly like Bernie?”","1839","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"“Open” is a reasonable description of Sanders’s campaign, which has worked to underscore the candidate’s ideological consistency over the decades. When Sanders started out, in the sixties, he was a civil-rights activist and a sit-in coördinator. After settling in Vermont, he worked in carpentry, wrote weird satirical erotica, and set about the business of losing elections. The goals of the young Sanders were a lot like the goals of Sanders now. From 1981, in his first elected post, as the mayor of Burlington, he fought for corporate regulation and against big-money fund-raising. He sought to lift the minimum wage. Recently, his supporters have produced old footage from his early years, as if to show that, in a field of opportunists, Sanders has held firm to his beliefs. The anachronism of his world view proves both his authenticity and his lack of hidden baggage as a candidate. For young voters, who approach the booth with shallow political memories, this “open” attitude toward Sanders’s past can come as reassurance: they don’t have to worry about being pinioned by a history that they don’t know, because history, for Sanders, is a backward projection of the behavior that they saw last week. The approach is striking in an era when even personal life is preconceived, polished, performed. Sanders is exceptional because he seems, demonstrably, the same guy who he was before the iPhone cameras first appeared.","1840","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"The nature of that lineage may play a role in Sanders’s youthful popularity, too. He speaks often of “revolution,” as in: “Today, we begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially, and environmentally.” Revolution is a term that’s rarely heard now, but it recalls the period when Sanders landed on his political cause. Radicalism nostalgia—the Boomer-propagated idea that the sixties were a halcyon age in American culture—survives today even among people born decades later. For the uninitiated, Sanders is a link back to that heady time. “Neil Young playing at the end of #BernieSanders SC speech is making me hippie fangirl out,” someone far below the hippie age cutoff tweeted this past weekend. Now that American youth culture is increasingly business-oriented—there are shopping recommendations based on your exact location, parties with playlists picked by subscription algorithm, and privatized mobile transportation apps to ferry you between—Sanders’s tinge of hippiedom, his seeming lack of calculation, lets members of the smartphone generation embrace the political sixties trip they never had.","1841","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"Hillary Clinton, an establishment figure whose very breath seems mediated by design and process, is curiously at odds with this moment in liberal life. Sanders is closer. The outrages of the past year—Ferguson, Baltimore, Staten Island—have inaugurated a new era of direct action for progressives. The grassroots radicalism that, for years, relegated Sanders to the wingnutty sidelines of the field now bind him to the liberal zeitgeist. When the kids laud Sanders for being “logical” or “clever,” they are speaking of the logic of his activism—his cause-and-direct-effect rationale for stepping in, his eagerness to revamp the entire system—more than his adeptness as a political strategist. For people to whom statecraft seems mandarin and unknowable, Sanders offers a point of entry from the outside.","1842","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"Is “Feel the Bern” Howard Dean 2.0? It’s hard not to think about the last Vermonter who summoned the youth vote, churned the Internet, and seemed to threaten the establishment’s preferred nominee.But there are differences. For one thing, Dean reached beyond Vermont parochialism with a hard-edged foreign policy: he made strong opposition to the invasion of Iraq a central point of his campaign. Though Sanders’s foreign-policy stances have been reported, his platform tends to double back to the domestic. (Since global affairs are Clinton’s home field, it’s a reasonable strategy.) On the other hand, Sanders enters the contest at a moment when it’s possible to be taken seriously—very seriously—as a liberal with a youthful following. It was young people who famously helped lead Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012, when voter participation among those eligible under thirty jumped to about fifty per cent and secured him victories in four crucial states. Today’s Millennials, who will make up thirty-six per cent of eligible voters in 2016, have no such candidate to call their own, except for Sanders. If they were to vote at their capacity, they’d be the country’s largest voting bloc. As it is, they may be compelled to wave back the Clintons, their parents’ regime, into the White House.","1843","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"The “trustworthy” quality that Sanders’s young supporters find in him, then, is an accountability to process rather than to results—beginning with his campaign-finance practices. Trust in American politics has alternately carried two related but separate meanings. There’s the trust you feel in honesty of character, the old ideal of frank speech and lucid motives. And there’s the trust you place in your leader to get the job done. Often, these two trusts are at odds. We want our politicians transparent, yet we want them powerful as well, and power, even in the best of circumstances, means the management of information and the mastery of process. Direct action, in executive office, is demagoguery. For Sanders’s campaign to succeed in taking over the White House would, in some sense, be for its precepts to fail; the campaign is less about about wielding power than about guiding the Presidency from outside. “It’s not a political campaign to elect the man, but a campaign to change how American politics operate,” one young admirer wrote. In an era of gridlock and systemic abuse, trust in the sanctity of the political process may be the most valuable gift a young voter can get. Sanders shows the kids what’s possible, even if, strictly speaking, it’s not feasible yet.","1844","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/feeling-the-bern-with-the-youth-vote"
"Running for President is hard. And there are factors that can make it harder still, a variety of which Jeb Bush modelled this week, in florid fashion. It started with this exchange, with Megyn Kelly:","May 16, 2015","1845","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-ways-that-jeb-bush-makes-it-hard-for-himself"
"This wasn’t a good answer, even though, as Rick Santorum, of all people, correctly pointed out, “I don’t know how that was a hard question.” And, having made a mistake with the invasion, Jeb Bush proceeded to bungle the occupation, taking four days and many grumpy contortions to get from his first answer to the testy statement, on Thursday, that “Knowing what we now know, what would you have done? I would not have engaged. I would not have gone into Iraq.” Why was that so difficult? Here are five ways that Jeb Bush made, and may continue to make, running for President hard.","1846","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-ways-that-jeb-bush-makes-it-hard-for-himself"
"1. He didn’t listen. “I interpreted the question wrong, I guess,” Bush told Sean Hannity on Tuesday. He said something similar on Wednesday: “Whatever I heard, it was translated, knowing what you knew then what would you do?” But there was no ambiguity in Kelly’s question. Perhaps it was “translated” from the language of what was actually said to that of whatever Jeb Bush wanted to hear. He might have thought, in the lacuna of that “Yup,” I’m a smart guy and I know what Megyn Kelly is going to say, even before she gets the words out. Both of those explanations are, to an extent, credible, based on the Hillary Clinton reference in his answer. (She voted to authorize the war, but has said that her decision might have been different if the intelligence had been better.) But neither is admirable and both are harbingers of disastrous debates—not to mention Oval Office meetings (“Whatever the Prime Minister said, it was translated…”). Obama has his anger translator; maybe Jeb Bush has a complacency translator.","1847","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-ways-that-jeb-bush-makes-it-hard-for-himself"
"2. He didn’t have an answer ready. There are a lot of predictable questions when you’re running for President, and, after being sure that you know which is being asked, you should be ready to answer them. This would be true of questions far more obscure than a central decision of your party’s last President—a President who happened to be your brother. (It’s worth noting that some people were opposed to the war, knowing what they knew then.) After he and Hannity had dealt with the supposed mysteriousness of Kelly’s question, and Bush had delivered a swirl of phrases related to Iraq, in what appeared to be no particular order (“there were mistakes”; “the surge was quite effective”; “we need to make sure that our friends know that we have their back”), Hannity tried to get him to focus:","1848","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-ways-that-jeb-bush-makes-it-hard-for-himself"
"And in campaigns. How could Jeb Bush have come to an interview that was set up as a do-over without any answer at all? Perhaps it is because of his next mistake:","1849","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-ways-that-jeb-bush-makes-it-hard-for-himself"
"3. He assumed that people agree that “hypothetical” is a dirty, out-of-bounds word. “That’s a hypothetical”—well, yes, because you aren’t President yet, and we want to know what you would do if you were. That’s a hypothetical. Perhaps what Bush meant was “past-counterfactual”—but there’s nothing wrong with that sort of question, either. Bush is not alone in this trait, unfortunately; in the primary debates, we can expect to see many candidates using “hypothetical” as a synonym for “trick question” or “weird”—”gotcha” with five syllables, each an accusation of media fanciness. As a dodge, though, it falls apart with the sort of questions to which people expect a simple answer. Voters in the voting booth must make the best guess they can. Hypotheticals help. When Bush, on Thursday, prefaced his belated definitive answer with a sighing, snappish “If we’re all supposed to answer hypotheticals,” the effect was unpleasant. He sounded like…","1850","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-ways-that-jeb-bush-makes-it-hard-for-himself"
"4. He might live in a bubble. This is what confused Santorum: “I’ve been asked that question a hundred times.” Where and with whom does Bush spend his time talking, if he’s been avoiding it? His foreign-policy team might be too wrapped up in its own rationalizing, or, worse, an enduring belief that there was a lot of good in that war. But, as with the other bad habits listed here, this goes beyond Iraq, to the question of whether Jeb Bush is too cosseted by parental and establishment blessings—raising money has been easy for him—to realize what hard work becoming, and being, President might be. Yes, his brother did it, but he did it badly. As Santorum also said, of the campaign, “If you are not prepared for it, I think we’ve seen in the past you are not going to do very, very well. This is a long process.”","1851","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-ways-that-jeb-bush-makes-it-hard-for-himself"
"5. He suggested that his impulse to uphold familial honor was an answer, not its own question. Bush acted as if it were pure bad manners to ask him to comment on other Bushes. “I’m not going to go out of my way to say that my brother did this wrong or my dad did this wrong,” he said on Thursday, according to the A.P. “It’s just not going to happen. I have a hard time with that. I love my family a lot.” What are voters to make of “it’s just not going to happen”? Should they assume that, as President, he will say that his father and his brother were right, and act the same way? Or will he say that they were right, but then act in the way that he thinks is right, without ever reconciling those positions or explaining his own rationale? Maybe it’s indelicate to put one brother in the position of having to say what he thinks of another. But then the brother shouldn’t run for President. Delicacy in this case is the enemy of democracy.","1852","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-ways-that-jeb-bush-makes-it-hard-for-himself"

"When Martin O’Malley, one of the back-running Democratic Presidential candidates, accused “party bosses” of fixing the nomination process, it was enough to bring on a wave of nostalgia. Party bosses! The concept is as distant as a time when there really were party bosses, people like Thomas Pendergast, whose machine ran Kansas City when Harry Truman was a senator (bosses often came with “machines”), or Chicago bosses like Edward Kelly, in the Roosevelt era, or Richard J. Daley, in the Eisenhower-Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon era. But, despite O’Malley’s complaint, it is hard to make a case that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman who heads the Democratic National Committee, is a boss or controls a machine, even if the debate schedule—four “authorized” debates before the Iowa caucuses, on February 1st, and just six in all—does skew suspiciously toward the already widely known Hillary Clinton.

Priebus can seem like the dad in an old-time situation comedy, the ineffectual, slightly comic figure who accidentally switches shopping lists with a shady neighbor. Priebus aside, the Republican Party may nonetheless have acquired a new sort of boss, or perhaps anti-boss—Fox News Channel’s Megyn Kelly, who is politically alert, unflinching, and, to judge from the evidence of recent years, attuned to reality. That’s what so annoyed the onetime “mastermind” Karl Rove when, on the night of the 2012 election, he refused to accept the arithmetic of the decisive Ohio vote. Kelly tried to help him with the math, and their curious dialogue continued two days later, when Rove insisted several times that Obama’s victory wasn’t all that impressive and Kelly said, “You keep saying that, but he won, Karl, he won … and that’s what the Republicans care about, what the Democrats care about.”","1855","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"

During last week’s first Republican debate, her unnerving presence might have been enough to make Bush say (in response to a question from Bret Baier about family dynasties), “In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it,” a bit of self-congratulation that made no sense at all.","1856","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"
"Priebus has been trying for more than a month to get Donald Trump, still the party’s unlikely front-runner, to “tone it down,” beginning with Trump’s comments about immigrants, and continuing with his mystifyingly offensive comments about Kelly, who, during the Republican debate, was ready to take her shot and bag her trophy by quoting Trump to Trump: “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals,’ ” which sounded like dialogue from a Neil LaBute play, and asking if that showed a Presidential temperament.","1857","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"
"If Priebus really were a sitcom dad, he would be shaking his head and saying, “That dratted Donald!” But, in the real world, there is not much that Priebus can do. He has tried, like Schultz, to limit the number of debates (to nine), the better to escape the twenty-debate “clown car” stigma of 2012, and both parties are prepared to ban “unsanctioned debates,” though it’s hard to imagine how this could be effectively enforced.","1858","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-the-g-o-p-need-a-new-machine"

(Dwight Macdonald, in a short, cheerfully biased Wallace biography, emphasized the Vice-President’s attraction to spiritualism, numerology, and astrology, as well as his intriguing friendship with a Russian mystic.)

Rather, the beginning of the slow-motion end for Trump, if indeed it is the end, won’t have come from a private conversation among city bosses or a shove from Reince Priebus—or from the other Republican candidates, who are either ineffectual or have shied away. It may take years to understand what it means to give a cable anchor the power, and authority, to try to push a leading candidate off the bus.

"Bernie Sanders, the Independent socialist senator from Vermont and now Democratic Presidential candidate, is a serious man and a welcome addition to the 2016 race. Which is to say that, in the first week of his extremely long-shot challenge to Hillary Clinton, he deserves better than for us to dwell on an indiscretion that he committed nearly thirty years ago, in 1987, when, in the course of two nights in a Burlington studio, he recorded a five-song folk album called “We Shall Overcome.”","May 1, 2015","1861","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"On Thursday, Jonathan Karl, a reporter for ABC News, played a few seconds of a song off the album for Sanders on his phone. The seventy-three-year-old senator laughed gamely but tried to move the conversation along. “Look I’m worried about your viewing audience,” he said. “You’ll have mass click-offs.

"The Senator may underestimate the audience-enhancing possibilities of Internet virality, but he is probably correct to want to avoid being pinned down by this novelty, at a time when his very candidacy is being dismissed by some as just that. When the short album was rediscovered last year, by the Vermont alternative weekly Seven Days, it made brief rounds as a political curio, but now that Sanders is officially running for President, the songs will get a new and wider airing.","1865","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"Sanders is likely to come in for some ridicule from the ungenerous. While he never quite sings (the producer is said to have nixed that early on), he performs spoken-word monologues in his ur-Brooklyn accent—transcription utterly fails to capture his pronunciation of words like “marble” or “door”—backed by a chorus of thirty capable singers. At the time, Sanders described the intended effect as a localized version of “We Are the World,” and that gets it right. The smooth, blue-eyed folk spirituals conjure a different time and place—not necessarily the hardscrabble life and times of Woody Guthrie but rather a less disadvantaged era characterized by the Moosewood Cookbook and Volvos with rear-facing back seats.","1866","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"As for embarrassing songs to be caught singing in 1987, however, Sanders could have done much worse: it’s not as if he was doing karaoke versions of “Walk Like an Egyptian” or “I Think We’re Alone Now.” The album is a little batty in places: on “Where Have All the Flowers Gone,” Sanders opines about the threat of dangerous “laser beams” and warns against a coming Third World War. But, if you can get past the earnest bombast of the whole project, it sounds a lot like Sanders’s current progressive economic agenda—a musical accompaniment to his policy positions of supporting unions, raising the minimum wage, and reforming the tax code to make wealthy individuals and corporations pay their fairer share.","1867","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"In some ways, the album is a campaign consultant’s dream: on message, catchy, humanizing. (He’ll be lip-synching on Fallon by next week!) “Most of the people in this world work hard their entire lives and end up with very little. Others exploit that labor and end up with millions,” Sanders says on “The Banks of Marble.” He’s saying the same thing today, just without the backup singers.","1868","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"
"The album could conceivably give Sanders a kind of unexpected credibility as a national candidate. The mortifying musical performance has itself become a required act for ambitious American politicians. Just the short list includes such ear gougers as Bill Clinton singing John Lennon’s “Imagine” in Israel; former Attorney General John Ashcroft letting his broken eagle soar; Trent Lott “boom-bop-a-bowing” some white-boy doo-wop with the Singing Senators; George W. Bush donning a cowboy hat and white tie for a parody of “Green, Green Grass of Home”; John McCain warbling Streisand on “Saturday Night Live”; and Barack Obama scoring with a few credible bars of Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together,” and falling flat on “Sweet Home Chicago.”","1869","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"

But if we are to suffer in this corner of political inanity, I’d prefer to do it with Sanders, who on his recording of “We Shall Overcome” identified the problems facing the world: “War, starvation, the degradation of our environment, people being manipulated and lulled into a stupor by the mass media, consumerism, the futile striving for happiness by earning more and more money to buy more and more things—and on and on it goes.” I think he’s found his campaign song.","1870","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/swingin-bernie-sanders"

On September 16, 2009, we met with Representative Nita Lowey, the chair of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. As chair of the subcommittee, Lowey had more authority over funding for civilian activities in Afghanistan than anyone else in the U.S. Congress.

Before Lowey arrived with Clinton, Holbrooke cautioned us, “She gives us the money.” Lowey told us that a chorus of influential members was questioning why we were spending so much money in Afghanistan. The women’s caucus and others in Congress were up in arms about the lack of progress on women’s rights and fighting corruption, and about the ongoing dispute over the results of the August, 2009, Presidential election. Transforming Afghan society, Lowey argued, would take a long time and would be a permanent drain on the U.S. budget. Holbrooke responded, “Transforming Afghan society is not our mission. Girls’ education is a big issue in many places. We are in Afghanistan because of our national-security interests.”","1872","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"

At that time, we were trying—and failing—to get reconciliation onto the agenda of the policy review led by President Obama. In the papers we drafted, Holbrooke prohibited use of the term “political settlement” in favor of an inter-agency-friendly euphemism that we came up with: “threat reduction.” I outlined the concept of reconciliation for Lowey, noting that it would be possible only if the Taliban separated itself from Al Qaeda. Lowey looked at me with some surprise.

"No one who knew Afghanistan before 9/11 can fail to note the remarkable changes that have taken place there: the dramatic increase in life expectancy and decrease in child and maternal mortality rates; the elections for President, parliament, and provincial councils; the distribution of millions of cell phones, many connected to the Internet; the flourishing of the mass media; the construction of office and commercial towers, roads, and, airports; and, perhaps most important, the spread of education, which is creating a generation of professionals who, as they move into positions of influence, are sure to transform the country. And yet, after thirty-seven years of continual warfare, the population is traumatized. Both civilian and military casualties are on the rise. Extreme poverty, vulnerability, and violence, especially against women, are pervasive, as are government corruption and other abuses of power. And all of the progress hangs by a thin, fraying thread— Afghanistan depends on foreign aid to finance two thirds of the government’s operating budget and virtually all of its development projects and national-security forces.","1874","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"Many, including myself, have criticized the mistakes, misconceptions, and organizational dysfunctions that contributed to the shortcomings of efforts to build or strengthen the state in Afghanistan. But such terms presume a common goal of building peace and stability, whereas the U.S.’s “clear and focussed goal” in Afghanistan, as defined by President Obama has been “to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future.” The reason that the U.S. government has sacrificed thousands of lives and spent hundreds of billions of dollars on Afghanistan is because Al Qaeda attacked the United States while its leadership was based in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Other countries joined mainly because the United States took the lead. The intervention in Afghanistan was a counter-terrorist intervention. That, not analytical errors or bureaucratic politics, is why some U.S. policies proved to be obstacles to peace and stability.","1875","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"The conflict between the goals of counter-terrorism initiatives and peacemaking began at the U.N. talks on Afghanistan in Bonn, Germany, in November and December of 2001 (generally known as the Bonn Talks), in which the U.N. brokered a political settlement among Afghan groups opposed to the Taliban. The current regime in Afghanistan is based on that settlement, which included élites of the former royal regime (many from high-ranking Pashtun tribes and most of whom had been exiled since at least the early nineteen-eighties) and the armed groups, mostly non-Pashtun and Islamist, that were leading the fight against the Taliban on the ground. The U.N. team at Bonn, which was led by the Special Representative of the Secretary General Lakhdar Brahimi and on which I served, saw its mission as a continuation of the work of the U.N. Special Mission to Afghanistan, which had been trying, for years, to broker peace between the Taliban and the groups fighting them. Brahimi accepted that the ongoing war made it impossible to invite the Taliban to Bonn, but the agreement was meant to launch a process that would enable them to be incorporated. Multiple studies on political settlements of civil wars have concluded that the more inclusive the settlement, the more durable the agreement.","1876","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"

U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld overruled it, saying that there would be no negotiated solution. In a meeting in his office in November, 2008, President Karzai told me that soon after his inauguration, on December 22, 2001, he received letters of support from Taliban leaders who had returned to their villages.

In the first part of that meeting, a State Department official told a representative of the Rome group, a group of exiles led by the former Afghan king Zahir Shah, that his office needed to better account for the expenditure of the modest grant that the U.S. was giving it.

The U.S. did not include the expenditures of covert or military operations in the investigation of corruption until mid-2010, when several task forces began to oversee military contracts, though not C.I.A. contracts. This contracting with Afghan power holders, the total size of which is difficult to determine, provided much of the financing for the country’s patronage networks.

One of them told me that he had been stationed at the principal U.S. military base at Bagram. Perimeter security, he said, was the responsibility of a private company headed by a former Afghan commander. The commander’s brother had a factory that supplied cement to the base for construction. The commander, he noted, was the most powerful Afghan in the district. The profits that the commander and his brother earned from contracts far outweighed any capacity-building or rule-of-law assistance received by the local administration.

Initially, based on assumptions inherited from the previous Administration, the investigations focussed on the link between narcotics revenue and Taliban funding.

As Amiri and I paged through the slides, our astonishment mounted at the relationships it revealed. As Dexter Filkins reported in the Times in 2010, New Ansari was “suspected of moving billions of dollars out of the country for Afghan politicians, drug traffickers and insurgents.

He had once worked as a translator for the former militia leader (now Vice-President) Abdul Rashid Dostum, one of the commanders funded by the C.I.A. to topple the Taliban in northern Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. The Times also reported that Salehi was “being paid by the Central Intelligence Agency, according to Afghan and American officials.”","1884","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"There is no indication that the C.I.A. intervened to have Salehi released or did anything in violation of U.S. law. It was carrying out the mission that the President assigned to it—“to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan”—which involved paying Afghan officials for information or collaboration, even though, from the standpoint of Afghan law, those payments constituted illegal corruption. One part of U.S. policy corrupted Afghan officials while other parts tried to investigate and root out corruption. Given the interest that defined the mission, concerns about corruption did not trump those of covert action.","1885","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"Corruption is not a problem solely because it wastes money and undermines trust in the government. It can prevent the government from functioning. On March 5, 2015, John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, sent a letter to a number of military commands describing a fiscal crisis. The Afghan government could not meet its “budgetary obligations,” which mainly consisted of paying the salaries of employees, including teachers and health-care workers (but not security forces). One of the likely reasons for this is corruption in the collection of customs, the government’s largest source of the domestic revenue. U.S. officials estimated that corruption took about half of the potential customs revenue, according to Sopko.","1886","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"While some corruption resulted from weak oversight of the customs service, a larger problem was the domination of border points by U.S.-funded militias. Abdul Raziq, the security commander of Kandahar Province, was previously the commander of the border police at the customs point between Kandahar and Balochistan, where he is reported to have engaged in a profitable trade in smuggled used cars as well as the usual narcotics. Human Rights Watch also implicates Raziq in extrajudicial killings and the torture of detainees, including the “application of a power drill to their heads.” The U.S. military, however, has backed him and credits him with securing Kandahar City and expelling the Taliban from nearby rural districts. Even if President Ashraf Ghani wanted to remove him, for any number of reasons, he would have to weigh those considerations against the fact that Raziq’s security forces are responsible for the defense of Kandahar. (Raziq has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.)","1887","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"Furthermore, elimination of corruption in customs would be only a partial solution to the problem of funding the government. Customs revenues constitute about one third of domestic revenues, which currently pay for no more than one quarter of the national budget. Therefore, roughly speaking, even eliminating all corruption and doubling the customs revenues would enable the country to pay for less than half of its budget. And the budget does not account for donors’ direct expenditures, including, crucially, the billions of dollars spent by the U.S. on Afghan national-security forces. As a result, the solvency, security, and stability of Afghanistan depend upon the wisdom and generosity of the Congress of the United States.","1888","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"The pattern of assistance through institutions that the Afghan state cannot sustain is not the product of mistaken models. It is the result of an assistance program designed to support the immediate needs of the military campaign. In the spring of 2010, as U.S. commanders tried to apply General David Petraeus’s counterinsurgency doctrine to Kandahar, the military proposed a quick fix to the city’s electrical supply: hooking up the city’s distribution network to diesel generators and paying for the fuel. That would generate employment and good will. U.S. civilian officials objected that the Afghans would never be able to afford the millions of dollars of diesel fuel required. But, according to one military official interviewed at the time, “This is not about development—it’s about counterinsurgency.” Kandahar got the diesel generators.","1889","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"Five years later, the Department of Defense will terminate funding for the diesel by this fall, pulling the plug on this unsustainable project and on thousands of factories and homes. The U.S. has no convincing plan for the supply of electricity when it cuts the funding, according to a recent report by SIGAR.","1890","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"Today, Abdul Raziq claims that he has secured Kandahar, pushing the Taliban back more than fifty miles from the city. But what will happen after the autumn of 2015? Unemployment will rise, the economy will falter, and more young men may join the insurgency. If security deteriorates, the usual voices in Washington will criticize President Obama for withdrawing troops too soon. But, however long the troops stay, military operations will still favor tactically effective quick fixes that collapse when the troops leave, as they will some day. This is not the fault of the military: it has tried to carry out the task that the President assigned it. But the problem of Kandahar’s electricity illustrates why military interventions are unlikely to provide a framework for stability.","1891","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"Two possible models could keep the Afghan state and civil society operating at close to the current levels. The first is to keep assistance coming indefinitely. In that unlikely case, as Representative Nita Lowey foretold, a peace process might be a liability. Though a settlement with the Taliban could reduce the cost of the security forces, it would also reduce the perception that Afghanistan is a source of threats that require a sustained response.","1892","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"The second model is the one that I believe President Ghani is trying to implement: to start Afghanistan on the path to greater self-sufficiency and sustainability. Ghani appears to believe that such a path first requires peace with Pakistan and insurgents, coöperation with all the country’s neighbors to make Afghanistan into a transit hub or “roundabout,” and then the development of extractive industries for the country’s vast mineral deposits. Without a quick turnaround in global perceptions of the risks associated with investing in Afghanistan, capital will not come. Furthermore, since Afghanistan is a landlocked country, whose northern neighbors are also landlocked, it cannot connect domestic investments to world markets without efficient and economical transit through Pakistan and Iran.","1893","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"
"That, more than any political motivation, most likely explains the speed and radicalism of President Ghani’s turn to China and attempted rapprochement with Pakistan. It also illustrates the tremendous stake that Afghanistan has in any easing of tensions between the U.S. and Iran. When Ghani came to Washington in March, the media focussed on adjustments to the troop re-deployment schedule and pledges of assistance. But what Ghani needs most is political and diplomatic support, backed up by investment, to support a peace process, provide incentives for its success, and enable Afghanistan to start generating revenues to sustain its own state.","1894","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-have-we-been-doing-in-afghanistan"

"After living in this country for almost thirty years, I confess I find it hard to write about gun massacres. They are just too familiar, and too depressing. An alienated post-adolescent, almost always white, gets a gun, or guns, and exorcises his demons by killing as many people as he can. Then follows an equally predictable media outpouring, with round-the-clock coverage on cable, lengthy accounts in the serious papers, harrowing profiles of the victims, and why-oh-why editorials aplenty. Flags are flown at half-mast. Politicians, especially those who represent the area in which the massacre occurs, say that something needs to be done about gun control.","June 22, 2015","1914","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"Nothing much happens, of course, and, after a while, we move onto the next incident. Back in the nineteen-eighties and -nineties, for some reason, fast-food restaurants and post offices were the sites of some of the deadliest incidents. Then came a series of school massacres, including at Columbine, where Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed twelve high-school students and a teacher, and at Virginia Tech, where Seung-Hui Cho killed thirty-two people before taking his own life. In Newtown, Connecticut, in December, 2012, a twenty-year-old misfit named Adam Lanza murdered twenty elementary schoolchildren, and six of their teachers, before taking his own life, too. Then there were the 2012 shootings in Aurora, Colorado: twelve people gunned down at a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.”","1915","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"Which leads us to Charleston, and the latest atrocity. In this case, of course, we have the complicating and insidious factor of racism to consider. The suspected shooter, Dylann Roof, didn’t choose the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church at random. The evidence suggests that his alienation took the form of embracing white-supremacy claptrap, and that he wanted to kill black people specifically. When Roof reached Emanuel A.M.E., which is one of the oldest and best-known black churches in the country, on Wednesday evening, the members of a prayer group he encountered were so nice to him that he hesitated to go through with his “mission,” he has reportedly told police. Sadly, he managed to overcome his humane impulses.","1916","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and many others, including my colleagues David Remnick and Jelani Cobb, have pointed out how this tragedy reminds us that, in Obama’s words, “We don’t have to look far to see that racism and bigotry, hate and intolerance, are still all too alive in our world.” Did we really need reminding, though? The United States was partly built on racial cleansing and slavery: racism, and racist violence, have long been a part of its social fabric, as have efforts to root out these evils and eradicate them.","1917","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"

But the historic battle against racism and racial subordination shouldn’t distract from the other pressing policy issue at hand. On the death certificates of eighty-seven-year-old Susie Jackson, seventy-year-old Ethel Lance, and the rest of the victims, the cause of death won’t be listed as racism: it will be gunshot wounds. Roof’s despicable views didn’t kill anybody: the weapon he used was a .45 mm Glock handgun, which, according to the police, he bought at a local gun store.","1918","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"

"Americans have always owned firearms, but the numbers have been increasing. Fifty years ago, according to government estimates, there were about a hundred million privately owned guns, or roughly one for every two people in the country. By 2009, the number of guns had more than tripled, to three hundred and ten million: one hundred and fourteen million handguns, one hundred and ten million rifles, and eighty-six million shotguns. Since many more guns are sold every day, it’s probably safe to assume that the over-all number is now closer to three hundred and fifty million. That’s more than one for every resident of the United States, the highest number, per capita, of any country in the world.","1920","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"When you turn your country into an armory it’s hardly surprising that you end up with a lot of gunshot deaths—more than thirty-three thousand in 2013, of which more than eleven thousand were homicides.

"To his credit, Obama told the mayors’ conference, “I refuse to act as if this is the new normal.” And Hillary Clinton, in a speech at the same venue on Saturday, echoed the President’s remarks, saying, “We must tackle this challenge with urgency and conviction.” But does anybody really think that will happen? After the Newtown massacre, the White House tried to persuade Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and to expand background checks for gun purchases. In a series of votes in the U.S. Senate on April 17, 2013, supporters of these measures failed to get the sixty votes necessary for passage of these measures.","1922","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"From the public gallery, family members of people killed at Aurora, and in other gun massacres, shouted “Shame on you.” Arguably, the family members should have shouted, “Shame on us.” Other countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, learn from these sorts of tragedies and respond to them with new laws, which work. (Since 1996, when Australia banned rapid-fire rifles, made it more difficult to buy handguns, and launched a national gun-buyback program, the number of gun deaths has fallen sharply, and there have been no mass murders by firearm.)","1923","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"In this policy area, as in others, the American political system has largely lost the capacity to learn and react. The Republican Party is in league with the National Rifle Association, one of whose board members reportedly suggested that Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who died in the Charleston shootings, was partly to blame for the massacre because, as a state senator, he had voted against concealed-carry laws. The Democratic Party, although it contains many individuals who support gun control and have campaigned for it, remains wary of alienating rural voters. Hillary Clinton, for example, while calling for “common-sense gun reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable,” was also careful to say “gun ownership is part of the fabric of a lot of law-abiding communities.” She added that reforms could be introduced “while respecting responsible gun owners.”","1924","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"
"There is good reason for this caution. In 1993 and 1994, Bill Clinton’s administration pushed through two significant gun-control measures, including a ban on assault weapons, sparking an N.R.A.-led backlash that some Democratic leaders blamed for the Republicans’ sweeping victory in the 1994 midterm elections. Since then, the country has settled into a violent equilibrium, in which gun sales and gun deaths proliferate.","1925","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/from-columbine-to-charleston-will-america-ever-learn"

"Forty years ago, when Jimmy Carter, a former one-term Georgia governor, was running for President, a headline in the Atlanta Constitution said, “Jimmy Who Is Running for What!?” Carter got little respect from the Democratic Party establishment, from the inhabitants of Georgetown, or from the influential Times columnist James Reston, who referred to the five-feet-nine candidate as “Wee Jimmy.” But Carter and his so-called Peanut Brigade had a plan: to spend a lot of time in Iowa, a state with a curious tradition—voting in highly personal caucuses—where George McGovern had, four years earlier, almost defeated the front-runner, Edmund Muskie. Although he finished ten points behind “uncommitted,” Carter won the state. Assessing Carter’s talent and endurance, a few political journalists guessed the future, and may have “invented” the Iowa caucuses by focussing on Carter and treating his victory as one of primary importance.","May 1, 2015","1927","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"

"What has since become clear is that participants and observers at the time, in an unacknowledged, unplanned collaboration, were conducting a political experiment: to discover whether it was possible for a “Jimmy Who?” to run for President with little money (Carter and his volunteers often slept in the homes of supporters), no major backers, and a mostly skeptical press, and to do so while facing big-league talent, which then included the senators Henry (Scoop) Jackson, of Washington, and Birch Bayh, of Indiana; the former Vice-President Hubert Humphrey; and the thirty-eight-year-old governor of California, Jerry Brown. I met Carter at about that time, in upstate New York; he was there to meet local Party officials and, accompanied by an entourage of about two people, worked the room, saying again and again, “I’m Jimmy Carter, from Georgia!”","1929","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"So far this year, only one big-league Democrat, Hillary Clinton, has declared her candidacy, and she promptly set out for Iowa. Her visit lasted three days, taking her to “small” events, including a fast-food meal, and she brought along dozens of campaign workers, who will stay behind and keep working there. In an op-ed published in the Des Moines Register, she talked about the “great ideas” she got from her trip: “I will carry the stories and wisdom of the Iowans I met with me throughout the campaign and hopefully onto the White House.” According to the Washington Post, Clinton’s op-ed mentioned five Iowans, all of whom happened to be among the thirteen selected for one of her carefully organized roundtables. Not much was being left to chance.","1930","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Clinton is some forty points ahead of other Democrats in Iowa, so it’s easy to write off her potential competitors, among them the former Maryland governor (and, ahem, former Baltimore mayor) Martin O’Malley and the former Virginia senator Jim Webb, both of whom are “exploring” possible runs; and the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who calls himself a Democratic Socialist, and who has skipped the exploration step. Sanders’s appeal is close to that of the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who seems to mean it when she says she’s not running, although, as Ryan Lizza reported, she intends to make her influence felt.","1931","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"But for all that, perhaps it’s too early to declare the race over. Webb is a particularly interesting case. Like Jimmy Carter, he’s a Southerner, a veteran (in Webb’s case, a decorated combat veteran), and out of step with the Party on some issues (he strongly supports gun ownership). Yet, like Warren and Sanders, he has little sympathy for Wall Street (for years, he’s made an issue of income inequality), and he showed an early willingness to take on such issues as mass incarceration—“courageously stepping into the void, calling for a national commission to re-assess criminal justice policy,” as a Times editorial put it in 2008. (Clinton, in the wake of the rioting in Baltimore, just made it one of her issues, too.)","1932","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"The candidacies of O’Malley, Sanders, and Webb, and probably others, might be seen as an updated version of the Carter experiment—to discover, as Webb recently told George Stephanopoulos, whether it’s “possible to conduct a viable campaign” in conditions that, in 2016, seem to make the venture preposterously out of reach. The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, one of the Republican front-runners, referred to those conditions the other day when he said that a candidate shouldn’t need a billion dollars to run (this is the obscene amount that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, give or take a few million, each spent in 2012) while announcing that he’d already set a record for fund-raising in the first hundred days. (Bush didn’t reveal figures, but the Wall Street Journal noted that the previous record was held by Hillary Clinton, who raised thirty-six million dollars in her first hundred days, in 2008.)","1933","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Unlike the Republicans, who have already scheduled at least six debates before the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic schedule is T.B.D., and it’s possible that voters won’t even get a chance to see the Democratic candidates side by side. Clinton was often formidable in debates in 2008, when she competed with Barack Obama, as was Webb in 2007, when Democrats picked him to respond to George W. Bush’s State of the Union message. He addressed income disparity (“When one looks at the health of our economy, it’s almost as if we are living in two different countries”) and, with devastating accuracy, Iraq: “The President took us into this war recklessly. He disregarded warnings from the National Security Advisor during the first Gulf War, the chief of staff of the Army, two former commanding generals of the Central Command … and many, many others with great integrity and long experience in national-security affairs. We are now, as a nation, held hostage to the predictable ­ and predicted ­ disarray that has followed.” Webb, though, didn’t seek reëlection in 2012, in large part because he deeply disliked the business, and the politicking, of politics, a real drawback if he is serious about running for President. And if he is serious, he will no doubt have to revisit some earlier statements, such as in a 1979 magazine article in which he argued against a combat role for women in the military, and his complicated view of affirmative action. Yet he appears able to change his mind; like many others, he has been “evolving” on the question of same-sex marriage, and on “Meet the Press” said, “I think this has been a good thing for the country.”","1934","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"
"Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has weaknesses that won’t simply vanish—most recently, the bad publicity surrounding the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, a charitable enterprise vulnerable to charges of mismanagement and conflicts of interest, which, as the New York columnist Jonathan Chait wrote, was “a kind of quasi-government run by themselves, which was staffed by their own loyalists and made up the rules as it went along.” All that is only increasing the appetite of the Republican contenders. There are many on that side, some of them unnervingly weird, all of them ravenous for the Presidency, and all wanting nothing more than to face a candidate who, like Jeb Bush, will have a hard time exciting voters looking for nondynastic faces and fresh ideas.","1935","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-primary-experiment-jimmy-who"

He would never have been allowed out of the box. No one would have paid attention to him.” That was in a time before techno-consultants and bottomless wells of money, when it still seemed possible for a Jim or Martin or Bernie “Who?” to alter a race whose outcome appeared predetermined.

Now she lived in a modest, well-kept high-rise overlooking the factory where they made Bonomo Turkish Taffy. The reward for passable behavior during these visits was the promise of a ride on the Cyclone (this occurred precisely zero times) or a warning-laden “stroll” on the beach: “Careful!

One son, Donald Trump, took up his father’s example, slathered it in gold leaf and topped it with world-class cubic zirconia, cultivated a head of pumpkiny, multidirectional hair, accumulated billions of dollars (though likely fewer billions than he’s claimed), and, by the eighties, became the P.

Over the years, we have been treated to Trump hotels, Trump magazine, Trump Airlines, Trump apartment buildings, Trump golf courses, Trump reality shows, Trump University, Trump the Game, Trump Chocolate, Trump the Fragrance, Trump Model Management, Trump Ice, Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka.","1939","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"The personal brand is, depending on your inclinations, a gilded jackass or an up-from-nothing tell-it-like-it-is-type-a-guy (without the up-from-nothing part). But it’s always been more than buffoonish entertainment. The sheer number of people and peoples who Trump has managed to insult, bully, and mistreat is, in its way, awe-inspiring. He congratulated Alejandro González Iñárritu for winning numerous Oscars for “Birdman” with this gracious remark: “Well, it was a great night for Mexico, as usual in this country.” He once told Bryant Gumbel, in an interview for an NBC program on race, what he thought about affirmative action: “If I was starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I really do believe they have the actual advantage today.” In the seventies, the Trump real-estate company was sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in its rental practices in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Queens. After settling the case with Trump, the Justice Department sued yet again for non-compliance. In 1989, Trump took out an ad in the Daily News, and three other newspapers, about the Central Park jogger rape case, in which he declared that the “criminals of every age” who had been arrested twelve days earlier—five African-American and Hispanic teen-agers—were “crazed misfits,” part of “roving bands.” “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY,” the ad read. “BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” Years after it turned out that someone else had committed the crime, and the young men had finally been released from prison, Trump wrote an unapologetic op-ed for the paper in which he called the city’s push for restitution payments to the men “a disgrace.” He made it plain that, to him, their lives were nothing, and, besides, “These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels.”","1940","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Trump’s blithe moral contempt has many targets. Women? He once told Esquire, “You know, it doesn’t really matter what [the media] write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.” Climate change? Here’s a tweet, circa 2012: “It’s freezing and snowing in New York—we need global warming!” Trump has been among the country’s foremost (i.e., loudest) “birthers,” constantly prompting the idea, against all evidence, that Barack Obama was born in some other country and, therefore, is constitutionally unable to hold the office.","1941","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Trump is now running for President of the United States. His platform appears, in the early stages, to be a smelly soup of billionaire populism and yahoo nationalism—all flavored with a tangy dollop of old-timey racism. On Mexicans: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” (When challenged that a report he cited concerned immigrants who had been raped, he said, “Somebody’s doing the raping!”) Donald Trump is currently polling second among Republican primary voters in New Hampshire, Iowa, and nationally.","1942","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Trump has polled impressively, and fleetingly, before. His name recognition is high (thanks to his frenetically cultivated “brand”). His moment will pass, the experts say. And it probably will—or, at least, the current moment will. His miserable comments about Mexican immigrants have already cost him business. NBC, which came under heavy pressure from a Hispanic media-watchdog group and many viewers, severed ties with him, as has Macy’s, which carried his clothing line. Trump’s political and ideological forays have generally been promotional brand extensions, lasting only as long as they were, in his view, good for business; the whole con might end well before the first snows in Sioux City and Manchester.","1943","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard and an ideologist of the neoconservatives, is quick to say that he does not support Trump, but counsels the Republican Party to learn from his blunt political themes: pro-toughness, pro-winning, anti-Obamacare, etc. Kristol’s goal is to avoid the nomination of a mumbly centrist who refuses to attack head on the Obama legacy and, presumably, Hillary Clinton. If the Party fails to find an aggressively conservative candidate, he believes, Trump or someone like him might play the role of Ross Perot, siphoning away right-wing populist voters from the G.O.P.","1944","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Trump’s Republican opponents seem wary of calling him out in anything like harsh terms. They handle him as they would a live grenade. Jeb Bush, the one Republican in the mobbed field who is running ahead of Trump in New Hampshire, waited a few weeks before commenting on the latest outrage about Mexican rapist-immigrants storming our southern borders. Bush, who is married to a Mexican-American woman, did say the comments were “ugly,” and added that he was “absolutely” offended on a personal level. And yet his remarks, like those of other candidates, were calibrated to assure the public that Trump’s comments were “not reflective of the Republican Party.” As if this had been a misstep, an aberration, and not typical Trump. Some are unwilling to go even that far. Chris Christie distanced himself from Trump’s rant, too, but he was quick to add, “I like Donald. He’s a good guy.”","1945","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Christie is not alone in his affection. Recently, on “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart gave Bill Clinton plenty of room to tee off on Trump. Clinton declined. Trump, he said, with a wily smile, “has been, believe it or not, uncommonly nice to Hillary and me.” Perhaps. Not long ago, on MSNBC, Trump said that Clinton was “probably” the best of the four most recent Presidents. Then he added, “Frankly, had he not met Monica, had he not met Paula, had he not met various and sundry semi-beautiful women, he would have had a much better deal going.” That “sundry semi-beautiful” bit was an especially, even uncommonly, nice Trumpism. Hillary Clinton, for her part, could not bring herself to do anything more than tap Trump on the wrist. She told CNN that she was “very disappointed” in Trump’s remarks about Mexican immigrants—which, considering the fact that the Clintons attended one of Trump’s weddings, seems quite polite. But very disappointing.","1946","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"It’s a wonder, though, that Kristol is so concerned. In large measure, when it comes to issues like marriage equality and Obamacare, the Republicans have come through with Spenglerian stir-the-base rhetoric. After the announcement of the Supreme Court decision on marriage equality, Ted Cruz declared, “Today is some of the darkest twenty-four hours in our nation’s history.” Rick Santorum said that the Court’s decision “put the nail in the coffin” of the institution of marriage itself. “The climate is changing,” the milder Jeb Bush has allowed, but adds, against nearly absolute scientific consensus, “whether men are doing it or not.”","1947","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"History is replete with joke candidates for high office. Will Rogers ran for President, in 1928, as the standard-bearer of the Anti-Bunk Party, and wrote a book about his experience: “He Chews to Run.” One Yetta Bronstein, an (imaginary) citizen of the Bronx and the creation of a hoax artist named Alan Abel, was on Presidential campaign posters, in 1964 and 1968, promoting fluoridation, sex education, and, oddly, bingo. (“Vote for Yetta and watch things get better.”) At the 1968 Democratic Convention, in Chicago, the Yippies put forward their candidate: Pigasus. And, for a brief time in 2007, Stephen Colbert entered the race, promising “truthiness” for all.","1948","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"Donald Trump is a joke, too, but of a different sort. His intention is not to inspire laughter or relief; his targets are not the powerful. He doesn’t punch up. He spews forth ugliness everywhere he goes. It would be nice, and maybe wise, simply to ignore him, in the hope that he will, after all these many years, just go away. But he never really does, and the most immediate concern is not that he will win the office he pursues but that he will get in the heads of the candidates around him. Trump’s father was a self-promoter who dispersed discounts in his balloons. The son offers only toxic gas.","1949","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-balloon"
"If the 2016 Presidential campaign seems unusually gloomy, it’s not hard to see why, starting with the cowardice revealed by those Republicans who, after the sickening murders in Charleston, were, for too long, unable to utter a declarative sentence when asked whether the Confederate flag flying over the South Carolina statehouse (the one that went up in 1962, to protest the civil-rights movement) should come down and whether the flag had a proper place in any public building. Other Republicans took a break from that line of thought to promise to “resist” marriage equality, now legal in fifty states. So much for the Party of Lincoln.","June 30, 2015","1950","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"Charleston seems to be forcing at least some Republicans to confront the party’s post-Barry Goldwater problem with race.

"Otherwise, seventeen months before the general election, and despite the welcome offstage diversions of those Supreme Court decisions—affirming same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act—the language of the 2016 race has been unnervingly free of thought. It’s as if a politically themed Pandora has been supplying the words and phrases most likely to please each constituency. On Roosevelt Island earlier this month, for instance, when Hillary Clinton tried to explain why she’s running, she promised to be in just about everyone’s corner: “For the successful and the struggling. For the innovators and inventors. For those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases. For the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day. For the nurses who work the night shift. For the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us. For the veterans who served our country. For the small business owners who took a risk. For everyone who’s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.”","1952","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"If that sounded familiar, it may be because Vice-President Al Gore said something very similar fifteen years ago, when he accepted the Presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention and said “Whether you’re in a suburb or an inner city, whether you raise crops or drive hogs and cattle on a farm, drive a big rig on the interstate or drive e-commerce on the Internet, whether you’re starting out to raise your own family or getting ready to retire after a lifetime of hard work, so often powerful forces and powerful interests stand in your way and the odds seem stacked against you, even as you do what’s right for you and your family.”","1953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"Gore also got there first with the “everyday Americans” whom Clinton intends to keep meeting and to “champion.” He spoke, he said, for “those who need a voice, those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up, so they are never left behind,” and he promised “to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your hopes, with the quiet everyday heroism of working families.”","1954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"When Senator Marco Rubio launched his campaign, in mid-April, he said, “If we reform our tax code, reduce regulations, control spending, modernize our immigration laws, and repeal and replace Obamacare”—still the required Republican cri de coeur—“the American people will create millions of better-paying modern jobs.” Clinton said, “We will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments. And we will make America the clean-energy superpower of the twenty-first century …. Now, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.” Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush accompanied dreamy projections of economic growth with an actual number: “There is not a reason in the world why we cannot grow at a rate of four per cent a year. And that will be my goal as President—four-per-cent growth, and the nineteen million new jobs that come with it.”","1955","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"As for American muscularity, Rubio talked about reclaiming the “mantle of global leadership,” Bush accused the Obama Administration “of running us straight in the direction of the greatest risk of all—military inferiority,” and Rick Perry said that “America has entered a time of testing, and our leaders are failing the test.” Former Secretary of State Clinton, as the front-running Democrat, faces some barriers to endorsing the “feckless Obama” theme. Rather, as John Cassidy has pointed out, she’s still explaining her 2002 vote to authorize the disaster in Iraq as well as her interventionist impulses that arguably contributed to making the situations in Syria and Libya worse. Voters may begin to wonder if lessons about the goals, and limits, of American power will ever be learned.","1956","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"With all this, voters certainly want to hear real ideas with even a scintilla of originality, and some of these are coming from candidates who are not high in the polls, such as Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, who has introduced legislation that would invest a trillion dollars—no more than the cost of a small Mideast war—to modernize the nation’s infrastructure over a five-year period. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has introduced what he calls the “Read the Bills Act,” which would require members of Congress to actually read the bills they vote on, a fascinating concept.","1957","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"
"In the real world, though, as every candidate must know, Presidents can’t provide child care, or innovate and invent, or, as we have seen over the past six years, even control the proliferation of handguns. What they can do, at their best, is urge the passage of transformative legislation (Social Security, the Affordable Care Act), promote domestic and international tranquility, and, if the nation is lucky, avoid—in President Obama’s phrase—“dumb wars.” They can bring a sense of orderly passage in a disorderly world and, when it’s needed—which is all too often—help to raise the nation’s spirits.","1958","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/campaign-speak-2016-edition"

"“I can’t run again,” President Barack Obama said yesterday, speaking in Mandela Hall at the African Union headquarters, in Addis Ababa. “I actually think I’m a pretty good President—I think if I ran I could win.” Obama, at the end of what is likely to be his final trip to the continent as President, was addressing the habit that too many African leaders have of making themselves leaders for life. His message was that this was a bad idea, even if they, too, thought they were pretty good Presidents. But he may also have been thinking about tremors of the 2016 Presidential race, which had been making their way across the ocean. As yet, none of the Republican contenders has managed to look at once substantial, serious, and sane. In some cases (Trump), none of these attributes has been visible. And then there was the rush of alarming debate on the nuclear deal that the Obama Administration had concluded with Iran. This is where Mike Huckabee came in.","July 29, 2015","1981","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"“I have stood in that oven door,” Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, who is running for President, said on Fox News, on Monday. He was talking about a trip he had taken to Auschwitz, and also, by his reckoning, about the Iran deal. Over the weekend, Huckabee had said that the President “would take the Israelis and basically march them to the door of the oven” by agreeing to “the most idiot thing, this Iran deal.” That was a bit much, even for certain Fox personalities. Sitting across from Huckabee, Geraldo Rivera told him that he loved him and thought he’d be a great President, but that, as a Jew, speaking on behalf of his extended family—“the Levys, the Riveras, the Friedmans”—he was offended. Huckabee, who had just finished explaining why Obama was acting like Neville Chamberlain, another person who “did not take seriously threats that someone was going to kill massive amounts of Jews,” did not back down. If he wasn’t meant to compare the gas chambers to contemporary policy choices, “Why do we have the Holocaust museum?” Huckabee asked Rivera, whose mustache was quivering. If one is looking for a way to separate out the strands of extremism, theatre, and—maybe—serious policy discussion in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination, these people are not here to help.","1982","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"Huckabee also said, “When the President and Hillary Clinton are calling you out personally, must be a good day.” Both of them had taken issue with the oven line. Asked about the remarks during a press conference in Ethiopia, Obama said, “The particular comments of Mr. Huckabee are, I think, part of just a general pattern that we’ve seen that is”—here, he paused, as if trying to contain his mockery—“would be considered ridiculous if it weren’t so sad.” He noted, though, that Huckabee wasn’t alone: “We’ve had a sitting senator call John Kerry Pontius Pilate. We’ve had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I’m the leading state sponsor of terrorism. These are leaders in the Republican Party.” Those sitting senators are, respectively, Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, and Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Obama was not exaggerating the tone or the content of their statements. Cotton is the freshman senator who persuaded his colleagues to sign a “Dear Ayatollah” letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader, in a fairly open attempt to sabotage the negotiations. His comparison of the Secretary of State to the Roman official who is said to have allowed Christ to be killed was part of a complaint, on “Morning Joe,” about the International Atomic Energy Agency having drafted some of the details related to the inspections foreseen in the deal. “John Kerry acted like Pontius Pilate,” he said. “He washed his hands, kicked it to the I.A.E.A., knowing that Congress would not get this information unless someone went out to find it.” That “someone” was a certain intrepid senator from Arkansas, who was just back from Vienna, where he had gone to closely interrogate nuclear inspectors himself.","1983","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"Obama might have also mentioned Lindsey Graham, who called the deal a “death sentence” for Israel. Jeb Bush said of Huckabee’s Holocaust language, “Those types of words don’t help,” and that there was a need for candidates to be more “civil.” (He also called Trump “vulgar.”) But Bush has also called the deal “appeasement”—raising the question of whether he thinks that the civil thing to do is allude to Neville Chamberlain, rather than name him. Graham and Bush are running for President, too. Obama, in Ethiopia, noted that it was a noisy race: “Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines.” But Obama also wondered why certain unhinged comments crossed the line, and others didn’t. Trump was condemned across the board when he said that John McCain wasn’t a war hero, but, Obama said, “when outrageous statements like that are made about me, that a lot of the same people who were outraged when they were made about Mr. McCain were pretty quiet.” That might sound petty—Obama wasn’t kept prisoner by the Vietnamese for years, as McCain was—until one takes a look at what’s being said in the field. Trump has attacked Obama’s parentage, citizenship, intelligence, patriotism, and legitimacy as a President.","1984","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"Huckabee’s comments were so crude that they offended members of an Israeli government that has condemned the deal as, in Benjamin Netanyahu’s words, a “historic mistake.” (“Nobody marches the Jews to ovens anymore,” Yisrael Katz, the transportation minister, said, according to the Washington Post. “If need be, we will know how to defend ourselves, by ourselves.”) But, as with Trump’s attack on McCain, it was also a reminder of how much nonsense gets a pass in politics—of all the defamation that doesn’t get decried.","1985","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/obamas-republican-noise-complaints"
"The argument that the Administration is making is that it’s not just vulgar to compare the Iran deal to the Holocaust. It is false to say that it endangers Israel, given that, in the estimation of experts who have examined it, the agreement is the best chance out there to keep Iran from having a bomb. That is the fight Obama is returning to: Congress has sixty days to pass a resolution of disapproval, setting up a vote that would likely fall between the September 11th anniversary and the second Republican candidates’ debate. For the deal to survive, Obama needs just enough votes to sustain a veto. On Tuesday, in testimony before Congress, Kerry spoke forcefully and in detail about centrifuges and inspections, and listened as Republicans told him what they thought he didn’t know. Representative Scott Perry, of Pennsylvania, who had taken his suit jacket off to better wave his arms as he tried to decide whether Iran was “a crocodile or a shark,” spoke over Kerry. “If the Ayatollah doesn’t like it, oh, boo hoo. We’re here for America. You represent America,” the congressman said. “So do you care more about this deal and the U.N.’s approval, or America sovereignty?” Kerry responded, “Congressman, I don’t need any lessons from you about who I represent.

"“Get a warrant! Get a judge to sign the warrant!” Senator Rand Paul, of Kentucky, shouted, about a quarter of the way through the first Republican Presidential debate, last night in Cleveland. His target was New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, but one might be forgiven for thinking that he was warding off some unseen men, equipped with handcuffs or straitjackets, come to take him—or possibly another of the ten candidates on the stage—away. But which one? The debate, hosted by Fox News, Facebook, and the Ohio G.O.P., was supposed to bring on a winnowing of the field. That doesn’t seem to have happened. No candidate looked dominant—not Donald Trump, who talked about all the politicians he had bought (“When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. … With Hillary Clinton, I said, ‘Be at my wedding,’ and she came to my wedding”), and not Jeb Bush, with his uncomprehending answers about his family connections (“Maybe the barrier—the bar’s even higher for me”). The minor candidates solidified their toeholds; the field even seemed to expand, as the moderators played a video clip of Carly Fiorina, who was seen as the winner in the earlier debate among seven low-polling candidates who didn’t make the cut for the prime-time stage. At one point, the candidates were asked whether God spoke to them directly. This could go on for a long time.","August 7, 2015","1987","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"Trump did make it clear that, if Trump were the nominee of the Republican Party, he would support Trump. The debate opened with a call for candidates to raise their hands if they couldn’t commit to supporting whoever the Republican nominee might be and who might consider running as an independent. It yielded what was, no doubt, the intended result: Trump, stage center, standing alone, hand raised, wondering why he should “respect” anyone given his position in the race. (“I’m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.”) Maybe that’s when he decided that the moderators didn’t like him. Megyn Kelly asked about his tendency toward misogynistic insults: “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals.’ ” Trump interrupted to say that it was “only Rosie O’Donnell”—an unparalleled moment in drive-by ad-hominem debate attacks. But O’Donnell (who tweeted, “try explaining that 2 ur kids”) wasn’t the woman in front of him, and so, after barking something about political correctness, he said, “And honestly, Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry. I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.”","1988","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"Kelly smiled. A few minutes later, she asked Scott Walker about his opposition to abortion even in cases when the mother’s life was in danger. “Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion?” she asked. Walker equivocated, essentially insisting that such a choice never really came up. But then there was never a moment in the debate that Walker really seized. (On Russia: “You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop.”) Walker, who has ranked ahead of Bush (though behind Trump) in some polls, may have had the most to gain in the debate. Instead, he plodded along, even as the abortion discussion veered into anti-choice one-upmanship, with Huckabee invoking “DNA schedules” as a reason to give fetuses Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Trump said that he’d “evolved” from the pro-choice views he’d held in the nineteen-nineties, in part because he had some friends who “were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn’t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar.”","1989","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"But where were the debate superstars? Cruz was more like a lava lamp. He seemed so oleaginous as he outlined hidden Iranian plots, and yet he has a core of fans who consider him profound; its members will be pleased with how he did. Cruz was upset that President Obama hadn’t defended crusaders and the Inquisition. Paul was upset that Christie had hugged Obama. Christie said that his more memorable hugs had been with the families of 9/11 victims. He also said that it was “completely ridiculous” for Paul to talk about limiting the National Security Agency’s surveillance of ordinary Americans. Christie wasn’t alone. When Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon, was asked whether he would countenance waterboarding, he said that “what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business,” as though there were no international Convention Against Torture, or simple ethical constraints. Huckabee said, “The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things.”","1990","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"The most fractured rhetoric on the purpose of American military action, though, came from Bush, and in a way that shows his weakness as a candidate. Kelly asked him how he could look at the families of soldiers who’d died in Iraq “and say that your brother’s war was a mistake.” His answer had a stream-of-consciousness quality to it. Bush mentioned twice how difficult it had been for him to talk to families of soldiers in Florida (“It was really hard to do”), said that Obama shouldn’t have left Iraq, and ended with something like a non sequitur about how “to honor the people that died, we need to—we need to—stop the—Iran agreement, for sure.” He has been asked this question, in one form or another, more times than there are Republican candidates in the primaries. He still doesn’t have an answer.","1991","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"Is it Trump’s fault that Bush comes across as well-mannered but nebulous? Trump does encourage brute branding. When one of the moderators said, “Mr. Trump, Obamacare is one of the things you call a disaster,” Trump corrected him: “Complete disaster.” But the other contestants seemed able to figure out what character they are playing in this reality show—Bush hasn’t yet, given that the role of “undisputed front-runner” doesn’t seem to be available. Rubio, for example, talked brightly about how Hillary Clinton wouldn’t be able to “lecture” him; he’s kept himself in for another few rounds. Rubio also suggested that anyone who complained about his lack of experience was aiding the enemy, since Clinton would win a “résumé competition.” The G.O.P. primary race certainly isn’t one of those. It is a collection of niche candidates, and the niches are so entrenched that it is hard to imagine how they will be shaken out. There is even a semi-sensible niche, occupied in this debate by John Kasich, the governor of Ohio. He made obvious points that have eluded many in his party: about not turning down Medicaid money that could help people in his state, or how, if he learned that his daughters were lesbians, his love for them would be what it always was: “unconditional.” The audience cheered for that. But it also cheered when Huckabee complained about the military trying to accommodate transgender soldiers. Bush, meanwhile, tried to explain who he was by citing nicknames others had given him. He boasted about being known as “Veto Corleone,” and later said, “In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it.” How do you earn a Jeb? And how is Jeb going to earn this nomination?","1992","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"“Our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid,” Donald Trump said, surrounded by leaders and politicians. A sign that the system was broken, he said, was how many of them listened to him politely—“You know, most of the people on this stage I’ve given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.” Apart from Rand Paul, the other candidates left the task of going after him to the moderators. (Afterward, Trump complained that Kelly “behaved very badly.“) Chris Wallace, of Fox, pressed Trump on the bankruptcy of four businesses that had been associated with him. Trump responded by offering up the sort of knowing assertions about how the system is rigged, which he tosses out to his supporters like coins. “I’m not going to name their names because I’m not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they’ve used the law. … When I use it, it’s like, ‘Oh, Trump, Trump, Trump.’ ”","1993","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"
"And more Trump. Before the bankruptcy question was done with, he’d insulted Atlantic City, saying of his creditors, who’d lost a billion dollars, “These lenders aren’t babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, O.K.?” Trump is here to confirm your fears, about killers and criminals, both among people in business or those trying to cross the border—“If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal immigration”—and then to offer something shiny. The wall that he’d build along the length of the border (“Mexico’s going to pay for it,” he told Bill O’Reilly last week) could, he said, have “a big beautiful door”—a classy one, no doubt. After the debate, Trump told Fox News’s Sean Hannity, “We had such a great crowd, and they really agreed with what I said,” which is a measure more of his gleeful shamelessness than the debate’s reality. Trump is having fun; he’s not about to leave. He’s ready to earn his Donald.","1994","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/nobody-wins-republican-debate-trump-stays-in"

"That group could really lower the abortion and teen-age pregnancy rates in this country. Oh. Wait. We have that organization. It’s called Planned Parenthood.

"And who doesn’t support that? Few federally funded organizations can realistically claim to have had more success. There is an almost unending stream of data showing that the numbers of abortions and pregnant teen-agers in the U.S. are at their lowest levels in forty years. The drop has been sharp. In 1991, sixty-two out of every thousand females between the ages of fifteen and nineteen gave birth to a child. In 2013, the figure was twenty-seven. The birth rate has fallen in every geographic region. It has fallen among whites, blacks, and Hispanics. It’s fallen in big cities and rural outposts. It has fallen on college campuses and in the workplace. Fewer pregnant teens also means fewer abortions.","1999","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/planned-parenthood-means-fewer-abortions"
"Could it be that education works? The U.S still has the highest teen-pregnancy rates in the developed world.

Clearly, however, better access to birth control and sex education has made significant impacts on unwanted pregnancies.

Once, he sent federal officials to lecture experienced scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, on the value of refraining from sex. Truly. In fact, almost every political group involved in the issue supports abstinence.

"“The Presidency should not be passed on from one liberal to the next,” John Ellis Bush, better known as Jeb—or, as his new campaign logo renders the name, “Jeb!”—said in a speech formally announcing his candidacy, at Miami Dade College, on Monday. It seemed to be one of his answers to the concern that we are headed for an election in which, whether a Democrat or a Republican wins, the Presidency will be passed from one member of a Presidential family to another. But he also suggested that this dynastic moment is just one of those things that makes America great: “In this country of ours, the most improbable things can happen as well. Take that from a guy who met his first President on the day he was born, and his second on the day he was brought home from the hospital!”","June 15, 2015","2006","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jebs-big-day"
"Logically, that should have been “future President,” since, when Jeb was born, George H. W. Bush, himself the son of a senator, was just starting in the oil business, and George W. was a six-year-old—but never mind. The stranger notion is that there is anything improbable about the children of a wealthy, well-connected family achieving high political office. (In fairness, maybe Jeb hasn’t gotten over the weirdness of George W.’s ascent.) After the two-Presidents line, Bush directed the audience to “the person who handled both introductions,” his mother, Barbara Bush. She was there in a peach cardigan and pearls—Jeb was wearing an open-collar shirt with no tie—and waved. Many members of the audience echoed the gesture with their red-and-white “Jeb!” thundersticks. Of course, Hillary Clinton has built her brand around her first name, too. Foreigners might think that we call our candidates by their first names because we have a casual, informal culture. Really, it’s because we don’t want to confuse them with their relatives in politics.","2007","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jebs-big-day"
"What is more surprising, to some observers, is that Bush’s campaign got off to such a bumpy start. This was supposed to be easy for him. He would raise a great deal of money early, sign up all the right operatives, the Party would gather around, and other contenders would either realize that there was no point in running or fade away, with maybe a few hanging around to give him some debating practice. He was, in a word, supposed to be the Republican Hillary Clinton. But the only part that has worked out so far is the money part. Bush has raised a great deal of it, but thanks to Citizens United there is such an extraordinary amount of money around that he hasn’t, in doing so, cut off the supply to his opponents. There are a good dozen of them, as Bush acknowledged with another only-in-America line—“It’s nobody’s turn. It’s everybody’s test, and it’s wide open—exactly as a contest for President should be.” But he’s also, it has to be said, not where Clinton is, in terms of experience and voter familiarity. His record in Florida came up frequently in his speech, but his two terms as governor are more comparable to her term and a third as senator when she ran the first time. Bush is, in effect, running the Hillary 2008 campaign—the one that didn’t end as initially expected.","2008","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jebs-big-day"
"Hillary Clinton was Bush’s main target in the speech—part of “the Obama-Clinton-Kerry team,” with “their phone-it-in foreign policy,” leading America to “the greatest risk of all—military inferiority.” He also said, “Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs, quote, ‘have to be changed.’ That’s what she said, and I guess we should at least thank her for the warning.” That’s not quite what she said. Speaking at the Women in the World conference, in April, she was talking about the failure of many countries to enforce laws giving girls the right to primary education and providing women access to safe childbirth and protection from domestic violence. For that pattern to be corrected, she said, “deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed.” It was not deftly phrased, but it was also not a call for the surrender of religion to “the progressive agenda.”","2009","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jebs-big-day"
"Bush’s point, though, was to connect Clinton negatively with the larger push for “religious freedom,” as a conservative reason to reject everything from the Affordable Care Act to the legal right of gays and lesbians to marry in North Carolina. He cited what he said was the “galling example” of the “shabby treatment of the Little Sisters of the Poor”; nuns, he suggested, had been punished because they “dared to voice objections of conscience to Obamacare.” In truth, the Little Sisters is a Catholic order that runs a hospital and has gone to court to challenge the A.C.A.’s contraceptive-coverage mandate for its employees—even though, as a religious order, it can already get an exemption to that mandate. Its argument is that even having to fill out the form for the exemption is a violation of the order’s principles. Bush, in one of his big applause lines, said, “It comes down to a choice between the Little Sisters and Big Brother, and I’m going with the Sisters.” But, given that the case is about the casuistry of what it means to fill out a form, Bush might be more on the side of Kafka on this one.","2010","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jebs-big-day"
"Bush brought up the Little Sisters, no doubt, because he and his advisers are still trying to figure out how ideological he should appear. Conservatives don’t think he’s conservative enough, but moderates don’t seem certain that he’s really all that moderate. On almost every issue, except possibly immigration (there was a Spanish-language section in the speech), the moderates are right. A couple of months ago, Bush finally acknowledged that, maybe, something had to be done about climate change. Then, in May, he seemed to grumpily backtrack, saying that the question of human responsibility for climate change was “convoluted,” and that “for the people to say the science is decided on this is just really arrogant, to be honest with you. It’s this intellectual arrogance that now you can’t have a conversation about it even.”","2011","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jebs-big-day"
"Bush did not, in his speech, entirely dispel the sense that there was something arrogant, or presumptuous, in his own pursuit of the Presidency. “We don’t need another President who merely holds the top spot among the pampered élites of Washington.” But maybe, the well-funded campaign-launch affair suggested, being among the élite wouldn’t hurt: you need a President who belongs. (At another point, Bush told the audience that he was “not just another member of the club.”) There was talk of a state visit to Cuba by “our outgoing President,” he said. “But we don’t need a glorified tourist to go to Havana in support of a failed Cuba. We need an American President to go to Havana in solidarity with a free Cuban people, and I am ready to be that President.” Both Clinton and Bush have, in their ways, suggested that Obama is a sort of tourist—an anomaly, just passing through. They know what to do in Washington. Jeb knows all about Presidents.","2012","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/jebs-big-day"

Forty-eight hours later, the Republican Party and its media supporters are busy debating Bush’s proposals, which included pledges to boost the economy’s growth rate to four per cent, simplify the tax code, and “clean up the mess in Washington.”","June 17, 2015","2013","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/will-the-trump-circus-hurt-the-g-o-p"

On Tuesday night, Trump was on “The O’Reilly Factor,” which is still the most popular show on the Fox News network.

Fox, the host of the first debate, has said that it will invite the top ten candidates in surveys of likely Republican voters.

"“Have you given any thought to the woman who should be on the ten-dollar bill?” Brianna Kellar asked Hillary Clinton recently. “You know, I am very torn about it,” Clinton replied. “I want a woman on a bill. I don’t know why they take the ten-dollar bill. Some people are now agitating for the twenty-dollar bill.” Indeed, ever since the Secretary of the Treasury, Jack Lew, announced, last month, that the next version of the ten would feature a woman, that has been the baffled response. Alexander Hamilton, as the musical opening for previews on Broadway this week reminds us, has much to recommend him: he was the immigrant son of a single mother who became a founding father and the architect of our financial system. Why take him off the ten, and leave Andrew Jackson, who brutalized Native American communities, defended slavery, and opposed a national paper currency, on the twenty? A group called Women on 20s had already been organizing a drive to get Jackson off and a woman on. Harriet Tubman won the group’s online poll of who that woman should be, and she seems to be the leading choice all-around. Even Miss Oklahoma named her, when asked in the interview section of the Miss U.S.A. pageant this weekend, after regretting that Oprah was not eligible (under the rules, you have to be dead)—an answer that helped her win the title. Worse, Lew said that Hamilton’s defenders shouldn’t worry: he’d still be on the ten, sharing it with the yet-to-be-determined woman.

"In 1845, Araminta Ross Tubman paid five dollars to a lawyer in Maryland, and asked him to look up the will of a man named Atthow Pattison. She was a slave, in her early twenties, but she had somehow got the money together. She apparently hoped that it would be enough to free her mother, Harriet Green, known as Rit, whom Pattison had owned and whom, Tubman suspected, he had intended to free. The lawyer told her that, legally, she was right: Pattison had left Green to his granddaughter, but stipulated that she should be freed when she reached the age of forty-five. Rit Green was much older than that already—the will had been written in 1791—but his granddaughter’s family was still holding her as their property. (The will also said that Rit’s children were supposed to be freed when they turned forty-five, another provision that their owners buried.) As Tubman’s biographer Catherine Clinton writes, “Whether it was mere indifference or intentional fraud, Araminta’s mother and her progeny were cheated out of their freedom.” The lawyer also seems to have told Tubman that there was nothing she could practically do to challenge the Pattison heirs. Five dollars had purchased only a confirmation of injustice.","2023","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/keep-hamilton-on-the-ten-put-tubman-on-the-twenty"
"On September 17, 1849, Araminta, who now called herself Harriet, ran away to freedom, along with two of her brothers. Their owner, Eliza Brodess—Pattison’s granddaughter-in-law—had been making moves to sell them, and the fear was that the family would be broken up. Brodess put an ad in the local newspaper, offering a hundred-dollar reward each for “Minty,” Harry, and Ben. (The only extant copy of the ad was found in 2003, in a dumpster.) Almost immediately, Tubman began making trips back to Maryland, organizing the escapes of relatives, friends, and scores of other slaves, often just ahead of armed men pursuing them. On one trip, she discovered that her husband, John Tubman, who was free himself, was living with another woman; he had no interest in going north. He is a man who seems not to have known Tubman’s worth.","2024","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/keep-hamilton-on-the-ten-put-tubman-on-the-twenty"
"“No slave who placed himself under her care, was ever arrested that I have heard of,” Thomas Garrett, a Quaker abolitionist and storekeeper in Delaware, later wrote in a letter. Garrett’s role, often, was to get shoes and other supplies for the travellers. One day, he wrote, after Tubman had been out of touch for a few months, she came into the store and said that God had given her word that Garrett might be able to come up with some money. Garrett asked her, “How much does thee want?” She said, “About twenty-three dollars,” a reply that he received with some wonder because, as it happened, he had received a five-pound note from a Scottish abolitionist who wanted to aid Tubman’s work. Garrett had exchanged the five, which, at the rates of the day, worked out to “twenty-four dollars and some odd cents,” and had the cash waiting for her—a twenty and change.","2025","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/keep-hamilton-on-the-ten-put-tubman-on-the-twenty"
"When the Civil War broke out, Tubman put her knowledge of the back routes of the South into the service of the United States Army, as a scout and a spy. Among other things, the intelligence she provided proved crucial in the capture of Jacksonville, Florida—a town named for a certain President who is now on the twenty, and who, in 1835, among other pro-slavery acts, gave Southern postmasters the authority to seize Abolitionist literature that passed through the mail.

"Secretary Lew, who can, technically, pick whatever portraits he wants, has responded to the arguments for putting a woman on the twenty by saying that the ten was the next in line for one of the periodic anti-counterfeiting redesigns all bills undergo. The twenty, however, will also need an upgrade soon. And there are four times as many twenties as tens in circulation. Given that women have waited a couple of centuries, it is worth getting this right. President Obama has the power to straighten this out—Lew would likely listen to him. Otherwise, there might be a need for a legislative move akin to a bill that Congress passed in February, 1899. At that point, Tubman, who was in her seventies, was living in upstate New York, largely on a pension she received as the widow of a Union soldier. (In 1869, she had married Nelson Davis, a bricklayer.) The amount of the pension paid to widows was eight dollars a month. In recognition of Tubman’s own military service, the bill, whose text included testimonials from three battlefield generals, raised her pension to twenty.","2027","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/keep-hamilton-on-the-ten-put-tubman-on-the-twenty"

"Donald Trump, as expected, was the big story of the night, but not in a way he would have wished. From the beginning, the three Fox moderators—Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace—appeared to be on a mission to knock him off his perch as the Republican front-runner, or, at least, to prove that he was worthy of the position.","2032","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Biff. That was Baier, with the first question of the evening, addressed to all the candidates but seemingly designed to force an acknowledgment from Trump that he wouldn’t necessarily support the Republican nominee and might end up running as a third-party candidate.

That was Kelly, with her first question to Trump, reminding him that he had described women as fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. “Only Rosie O’Donnell,” Trump interjected with a forced smile, but Kelly was in no mood for humor. “For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O’Donnell,” she said sternly. Obviously somewhat taken aback, Trump tried to downplay his sexist remarks as “fun, it’s kidding,” and then complained, peevishly, that Kelly hadn’t been nice to him.","2034","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Wallop. The sound of Wallace landing another haymaker on Trump’s comb-over, this time in the form of a question about four firms bearing his name that have filed for bankruptcy protection. Given a record like that, Wallace asked, why should we trust you with the nation’s finances? Trump replied that these were just four deals out of hundreds he’d done, and that, like many businessmen, he had only been using the bankruptcy laws to his advantage. And he personally had never gone bankrupt, he added. He should have stopped there, but he didn’t. When Wallace followed up with a question about the last bankruptcy, of the Atlantic City-based Trump Entertainment Resorts, in 2009, which cost nearly a thousand jobs, he couldn’t resist another tribute to his capitalist acumen: “I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City before it cratered,” he said. “I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I’m proud of it.”","2035","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"There were more tricky questions—about his many political flip-flops, and about the lack of evidence that he has provided to back up his claim that Mexico is sending criminals across the border to the United States. If it had been a prize fight and the judges had been members of the political commentariat, they would probably have adjudged Trump a standing eight count, or even stopped the contest before he suffered more punishment, some of it self-inflicted.","2036","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"But, of course, the judges are ordinary Republican voters, many of whom share Trump’s disdain for the political class, including political journalists. (“They are a very dishonest lot, generally,” he said at one point.) In the recent past, Trump’s run-ins with the media have only helped him, and we’ll have to wait for some post-debate polls to see whether this happens again. Although on the defensive for much of the time, he didn’t back down, and he came across, as he always does, as a man apart from the rest of the field. That, of course, is the key to his popularity.","2037","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Perhaps the most bizarre moment was when Trump responded to yet another tough question, this one from Baier, about why, in the past, he had made financial contributions to Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton. Trump said that he had contributed to “everybody,” including several people on the stage, and explained that his donations were strictly transactional. “When they call, I give,” he said. “And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me.” His donations to the Clinton Foundation provided an example of how this worked, Trump went on. “Hillary Clinton: I said, ‘Be at my wedding,’ and she came to my wedding. She had no choice, because I gave to a foundation.”","2038","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

(Paul was con, Christie was pro.) At another juncture, Trump and Jeb Bush got all lovey-dovey. “He is a true gentleman, he really is,” the former said of the latter, after the latter denied having called the former “a clown” and “a buffoon.”","2039","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

Walker took an early lead by bringing up Planned Parenthood and Hillary Clinton’s e-mail troubles. But Cruz, who never allows anyone to outflank him on the right, made up some ground late by suggesting that he had led the fight against Planned Parenthood, and pledging that, on his first day in the White House, he would “rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama.”","2040","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"Mike Huckabee, who also ran in 2008, didn’t say anything much of note. Delivering his closing statement, he seemed more like the proprietor of an auto shop than a man gunning for the White House. “I think America is in trouble, but it is not beyond repair,” he said. Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon turned politician, spoke softly, rarely pausing to sully his presentation with actual policy details. “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins,” he said in his closing statement. “The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.”","2041","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

He banged on about education and his record as governor of Florida, as he always does, and he avoided any nasty entanglements with Trump, or anybody else. The folks I watched the debate with, none of whom are political professionals, thought he made a pretty good go of it. On Twitter, the political experts said that he seemed nervous and halting.","2042","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"For my part, I thought Bush did at least as well as Senator Marco Rubio and Governor John Kasich, the home-town boy, whom many of the pundits hailed as the victors. Then again, Rubio almost always gets good reviews from the professionals. It is the Republican voters who have left him languishing, with about five-per-cent support in the opinion polls. Kasich, cheered by the crowd, appeared to be positioning himself as a more proletarian, Midwestern version of Bush. Most of his policy positions are solidly right-wing; his record is solidly right-wing. But he has one issue on which he’s broken ranks with his party—Medicaid. He said repeatedly that the Republican Party needed to present an inclusive and optimistic platform, and, in his swan song, he added, “People have hope again in Ohio.”","2043","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"
"In the end, though, the story was Trump, whose message was more downbeat. “Our country is in serious trouble,” he said in his closing statement. “We don’t win anymore. …We can’t do anything right.” Shortly after he left the stage, he complained to reporters about how he had been treated, noting that several of the other candidates had remarked to him that he had received the toughest questions. “I think Megyn behaved very nasty to me,” he said. Then, perhaps realizing that he sounded a bit ridiculous complaining about a debate moderator doing her job, he added, “I had a really great time. I thought it was a fantastic debate.”","2044","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-on-the-ropes-at-the-first-debate"

To be sure, they aren’t as titillating as speculating about whether Megyn Kelly and Sean Hannity are talking to each other. But if we are really interested in the outcome of the election in November, 2016, and the ultimate welfare of the country, they are much more significant. Taken together, they show how the G.O.P. is facing a dilemma that goes well beyond the fact that, for now, its Presidential primary has been hijacked by a self-promoting megalomaniac.","August 12, 2015","2046","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"The first announcement is that the “big-government crisis” is over. What big-government crisis? you may ask. The one that the Republicans cooked up in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when, partly owing to a slump in output, and partly owing to the Obama stimulus and other recession-related outlays, federal spending as a proportion of G.D.P. rose by about four percentage points—from 19.1 per cent in 2007 to 23.4 per cent in 2010. On the back of these figures, some G.O.P. scaremongers portrayed the President as a crypto-socialist intent on strangling the private sector and turning the United States into Sweden, Norway, or some other bloated welfare state where living standards are considerably higher than they are in the United States.","2047","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"Of course, none of the Republicans mentioned the last bit, but you get my drift. With federal expenditures rising sharply, the critics demanded big cutbacks, and they are still demanding them. At last week’s G.O.P. debate, virtually all of the candidates talked about lifting the oppressive yoke of government, and Jeb Bush repeated his pledge to cut the federal work force by ten per cent.","2048","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"What the Republicans don’t seem to have noticed is that their demand for a substantial downsizing has already been met. Thanks to a prolonged, if unspectacular, recovery in G.D.P., and to budget cuts endorsed by both parties at the local and national levels, the size of the government has been steadily falling relative to the rest of the economy. You can see this in the official statistics for federal outlays, which in 2014 fell back to 20.4 per cent of G.D.P. And you can see it even more clearly in the figures for government spending of all types, which includes spending at the local and state levels, as well as transfer payments and interest on the national debt.","2049","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"
"At the start of 2008, according to a valuable new analysis by David Beckwith, an economist at Western Kentucky University who formerly worked at the Department of the Treasury, this broader measure of government spending came to about thirty-five per cent of G.D.P. By the start of 2012, the figure had risen to close to forty-two per cent of G.D.P. That’s not quite at Scandinavian levels of spending, but it represented a significant jump. Since then, however, there has been a big drop, and over-all spending is back close to thirty-five per cent of G.D.P. In Beckwith’s words, “The huge run up in total government expenditures during the crisis is largely gone.”","2050","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"

They show that the number of Americans without any health coverage has fallen from sixteen per cent of the population in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, to 9.2 per cent in the first three months of this year. For the first time in recent memory, the percentage of uninsured people is in the single figures. “The health law remains controversial, and that will likely continue to be the case,” Larry Levitt, a senior vice-president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focusses on health care, told the Huffington Post’s Jonathan Cohn. “But we now have facts that can be used to judge the A.C.A. rather than hypothetical arguments, and there’s no doubt at this point that more people are getting insured and it’s making a difference in their lives.”","2052","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"

"A reasoned conservative response to the experience of Obamacare would be to accept the fact that it has done much of what it set out to do without bankrupting the country or destroying jobs, while also pointing out that it has had some nasty unintended consequences, such as a lack of competition among insurers in some areas and, in others, an increase in deductibles so large it may discourage people from seeking the care they need. But, rather than go down this route, almost all of the Republicans continue to demand an outright repeal of the law, without giving a coherent explanation of what they would replace it with.","2054","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-s-problems-go-well-beyond-trump"

Historically, British and American politics have often moved roughly in sync—one thinks of the Reagan-Thatcher years—and even today there are strong links between the major parties on both sides of the Atlantic. During the election campaign, David Axelrod, President Obama’s longtime strategist, worked for Labour, and Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager in 2012, worked for the Conservatives. (Yes, many Democratic eyebrows were raised at Messina’s decision to cross the aisle.) In addition, some of the internal party dynamics that drive the major British parties have counterparts here. In the Democratic Party, as in the Labour Party, liberal-leaning progressives are perennially seeking to shift the Party to the left, and running up against opposition from centrists. Meanwhile, the Republicans, like the Conservatives, are struggling to come to terms with the issue of immigration.","2071","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Inside Hillary Clinton’s campaign, there will doubtless be people echoing the Blairites’ argument that Labour’s heavy defeat demonstrates the dangers of straying too far to the left. And to some extent, at least, these people have a point. The Labour platform, which included a vow to raise the top income-tax rate and introduce a new property tax on multimillion-dollar homes, went over well in some areas, particularly the big cities, which are home to lots of liberal, college-educated residents, as well as many immigrants. In Greater London, for example, Labour increased its number of seats from thirty-eight to forty-five. But, in the suburbs and small-town England, the party’s progressive message fell flat, allowing the Conservatives to win an over-all majority in the House of Commons.","2072","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Despite this failure, it would be a misleading oversimplification to say that Labour lost because the voters rejected its redistributive tax plans, which actually polled well individually, as did many of its other progressive proposals, including raising the minimum wage, reducing college fees, and guaranteeing twenty-five hours of free day care each week to families with young children. Miliband got his biggest bump in the polls after he promised to close a tax loophole that allowed some rich British residents to pay no tax on their overseas earnings. And his claim that the Tories weren’t adequately funding the National Health Service prompted the Conservatives to come up with extra money for the socialized system.","2073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"It would also be an error to interpret the election result as an unqualified endorsement of the Conservatives’ austerity policies, which largely defined their first term of office under Cameron. Although the Tories slightly increased their share of the vote compared to the 2010 election—from 36.1 per cent to 36.9 per cent—the Liberal Democrats, whose participation in a coalition government had enabled the Conservatives to carry out their economic plan, suffered an unprecedented drubbing: their vote share fell from 23.1 per cent, in 2010, to just 7.9 per cent. As Matthew Yglesias pointed out in a post at Vox, the “total vote count of the austerity coalition … collapsed.”","2074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Labour’s problem was that, while it managed to increase its vote share slightly compared to 2010—from 28.9 per cent to 30.4 per cent—it didn’t pick up enough of the non-Tory vote. In Scotland, it was decimated by the Scottish National Party; in England, it lost a significant number of votes to the anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party. Among those defeated was Douglas Alexander, Labour’s chief foreign-affairs spokesman, who lost his seat in Paisley and Renfrewshire South, near Glasgow, to a twenty-year-old college student representing the S.N.P., and Ed Balls, Labour’s chief economic spokesman, who lost his seat in Morley & Outwood, a suburb of my home town of Leeds, to the Conservatives largely because a UKIP candidate took about an eighth of the vote.","2075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"The fate of Alexander and Balls, two experienced and moderate Labour politicians, demonstrates why it is dangerous, from an American perspective, to read too much into what happened to Labour. The Democrats have their challenges, to be sure. But getting squeezed simultaneously by a left-wing nationalist party and a right-wing nationalist party isn’t a danger that Hillary Clinton, or whoever else emerges as the Democratic candidate, will face. Indeed, because of the rapidly growing Hispanic vote in many areas, the issue of immigration, which was central to UKIP’s appeal, represents a big danger to the G.O.P. If the Republican candidate can’t find a way to neutralize this potential problem, he or she may well struggle to win key states like Colorado, Florida, and Nevada.","2076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"And that’s not the only difference between the United States and Britain. Another huge one is that the Democrats are the incumbent party, which means that they, like the Conservatives in Britain, stand to benefit from the recent improvement in the economy. As I’ve pointed out numerous times before, the performance of the British economy has been disappointing. Compared to previous recoveries, G.D.P. growth has been weak, and the average person’s living standard is still below the level it reached in 2008. During the past couple of years, however, things have improved somewhat: the U.K.’s G.D.P. has grown faster than that of any other economy in Europe, and employment growth has been strong. This upturn allowed the Conservatives to argue that things were getting better, and that, after all the sacrifices the country had made, it wasn’t worth taking a risk on Labour—a party many voters, rightly or wrongly, associated with overspending and large budget deficits. Focus groups and opinion polls confirm that the Tory message about the economy got through.","2077","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"The U.S. economy, like its British counterpart, has enjoyed a modest recovery in terms of G.D.P., with strong job growth. Many Americans still tell pollsters they don’t see much sign of the rebound in their own lives, but this was also true in Britain: the lack of a “feel-good factor” was one of the reasons that many commentators thought Labour stood a good chance of winning. In the end, though, the voters rewarded the Conservative Party for its stewardship of the economy. If the U.S. economic recovery continues into next year, which most economists expect to happen, the Democrats should reap at least some electoral reward.","2078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"None of this means that Labour didn’t make any mistakes, or that the Democrats can’t learn from some of them. Ed Miliband’s struggles since he defeated his brother, in 2010, demonstrate the importance of picking a credible leader who has a track record and is an effective communicator. Miliband, despite a better-than-expected performance during the campaign, never really met these standards. Practically everything he said about rising inequality, stagnant living standards, and Tory attacks on the needy and jobless was accurate. So were his arguments that the tax system has been skewed in favor of the wealthy ever since Mrs. Thatcher abolished residential property taxes, or, rather, replaced them with a poll tax (hence Labour’s proposal for a “mansion tax”), and that Britain needs to invest in education and infrastructure to build a high-skill, high-wage economy. But, although Miliband and his colleagues had the right diagnosis, they couldn’t persuade the British public that they had the right policies to tackle them. Labour’s proposals were individually popular. However, many voters apparently believed the Tories’ claims that Labour would spend irresponsibly and bankrupt the country.","2079","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"Here again, though, the situation facing the Democrats is very different, and incumbency is an advantage. Whatever economic platform Hillary Clinton cobbles together (and here I am assuming she gets the nomination), she will be able to point to a track record of growth and responsible fiscal management. Since 2010, the U.S. budget deficit has fallen from almost ten per cent of G.D.P. to less than three per cent. Despite Republican claims that Obama’s spendthrift policies were leading the country to rack and ruin, this prediction clearly hasn’t come true, and public opinion is starting to reflect that fact. As recently as 2012, according to Gallup, more than sixty per cent of Americans identified the economy as the most important problem facing the country. By April of this year, this figure had fallen to thirty-four per cent. And the number of people identifying the budget deficit or federal debt as the biggest problem was just five per cent.","2080","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"It could even be argued that Labour’s defeat should be more disturbing to Republicans than to Democrats. It is the G.O.P., after all, that is seeking to unseat an incumbent. It is the G.O.P. that is the more ideologically driven party. And it is the G.O.P. that has a record of squandering budget surpluses on its pet projects, such as tax cuts and military adventures. Miliband, despite his best efforts, couldn’t persuade voters that Labour wouldn’t go back to what many of them perceived (largely unfairly, as it happens) to be its old, bad ways. Come next year, Jeb Bush, or whoever wins the Republican primary, will face a similar challenge.","2081","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-real-lessons-of-the-u-k-election-for-2016"
"The debate in the economics community over the Trans-Pacific Partnership continues. In Monday’s Washington Post, Lawrence Summers, who promoted a series of free-trade agreements during the nineteen-nineties, when he worked in senior posts at the Treasury Department, said, “The repudiation of the T.P.P. would neuter the U.S. presidency for the next 19 months.” Summers also provided a series of reasons to be skeptical of the treaty, however, writing, “A reflexive presumption in favor of free trade should not be used to justify further agreements. Concerns that trade agreements may be a means to circumvent traditional procedures for taking up issues ranging from immigration to financial regulation must be taken seriously.” He later concluded, “Our challenge now is less to increase globalization than to make the globalization we have work for our citizens.”","June 16, 2015","2082","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"Meanwhile, in his column in the Times, Paul Krugman hailed Friday’s rebellion by many Congressional Democrats against efforts to give President Obama “fast-track authority” to negotiate a final version of the T.P.P., calling their vote to deny it to Obama a welcome defeat for the “Davos Democrats” who promote free trade and fiscal orthodoxy. This is the same Krugman who supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, and who spent some of the nineteen-nineties dismissing the promoters of so-called “managed trade” policies—like Lester Thurow, Laura D’Andrea Tyson, and Robert Kuttner—as “pop internationalists” who didn’t understand how things really worked.","2083","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"What explains this intellectual evolution? Summers and Krugman would say that there is no inconsistency between the positions they took on free trade in the past and what they are saying now. Recently, both of them have argued that the T.P.P. isn’t primarily a trade agreement at all, in the traditional sense of deals that aim to eliminate tariffs, cut prices for consumers, and allocate productive resources according to the law of comparative advantage, which David Ricardo promulgated in the early nineteenth century. Rather, the T.P.P. is largely a business-driven effort to extend more international protection to the investments, patents, and copyrights of major U.S. corporations.","2084","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"“Why do some parties want this deal so much?” Krugman asked on his Times blog, in March. “Because as with many ‘trade’ deals in recent years, the intellectual property aspects are more important than the trade aspects.” In his article on Monday Summers wrote, “The world’s remaining tariff and quota barriers are small and, where present, less reflections of the triumph of protectionist interests and more a result of deep cultural values such as the Japanese attachment to rice farming. What we call trade agreements are in fact agreements on the protection of investments and the achievement of regulatory harmonization and establishment of standards in areas such as intellectual property.”","2085","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"There is a good deal of truth in this argument. Last year, when parts of a draft T.P.P. treaty appeared on WikiLeaks, one of things we learned was that the U.S. negotiators were resisting efforts by other countries to get cheap access to life-saving drugs developed in the United States, and were pushing for the treaty to enforce drug patents that lasted twelve years. It’s no secret that lobbyists for industries such as pharmaceuticals, entertainment, and software have been pressing successive administrations to take a tough line on intellectual-property issues. (In his column in the magazine this week, my colleague James Surowiecki explores the power that the deal could confer on foreign industries to sue governments.)","2086","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"But I.P. protection isn’t the entire story. Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative, offered Politico’s Michael Grunwald some statistics meant to show that the T.P.P. would also tackle old-fashioned protectionism. Vietnam, which would be part of the new free-trade area, currently ”slaps tariffs of 70 percent on U.S. cars and machinery, 35 percent on U.S. chemicals, 30 percent on U.S. biscuits and baked goods, and 25 percent on U.S. recording equipment,” Grunwald writes. “Cars made in America face a 30 percent tariff in Malaysia”—another potential member of the T.P.P.—“which might not seem stiff compared to 50 percent on motorcycles or 35 percent on plywood, except that cars made in Japan and other Asian nations don’t face any tariff in Malaysia.” Froman didn’t say precisely how these tariffs would be treated in the final agreement. However, Grunwald reported that “he hinted that just about all of them will be cut or eliminated.” And that, presumably, would help U.S. manufacturers, just as a reduction on tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports would help U.S. farmers.","2087","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"There are still some (indeed, many) economists who are willing to make the argument that the T.P.P. would benefit Americans on the whole. The Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington, has published a series of studies detailing the purported benefits of the T.P.P. And the White House Council of Economic Advisers is still on board, of course. Recently, it published a letter in support of granting the President trade-promotion authority, signed by fourteen economists who have headed the council during the past forty years—going back to Alan Greenspan, who served in the Ford Administration. “International trade is fundamentally good for the U.S. economy, beneficial to American families over time, and consonant with our domestic priorities,” the letter began.","2088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"The letter’s signatories included three economists who have served in the Obama Administration: Christina Romer, Austan Goolsbee, and Alan Krueger. Summers, who headed the National Economic Council during Obama’s first term, didn’t sign it, despite the White House’s insistence that the T.P.P. would boost labor rights and environmental protection—causes Summers singled out in his op-ed. Another conspicuous absentee was Columbia’s Joseph Stiglitz, who served in the Clinton Administration, and who has emerged as a prominent critic of the T.P.P. Evidently, Summers, Stiglitz, and Krugman—perhaps the three most famous economists in the country—all agree with Hillary Clinton, who said over the weekend that President Obama should listen to the Congressional Democrats, particularly Nancy Pelosi, who voted against him last week.","2089","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"In short, the Democratic Party’s intellectual consensus on free trade has been shattered, and it’s pretty clear why. The fact that, as Summers noted, tariffs have already come down is part of the story. Another factor is the general hostility toward the pharmaceutical industry and other corporate rent collectors, and toward the secrecy that pervades trade negotiations. But the bigger story is that, so far, free trade and globalization have failed to deliver the material benefits to ordinary Americans, and particularly to American workers, that were advertised. Over time, Democratic politicians and economists have been forced to acknowledge this fact.","2090","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"Inside the economics profession, the revisionism arguably began in 1997, with the publication of Dani Rodrik’s book “Has Globalization Gone Too Far?” and continued with Stiglitz’s “Globalization and Its Discontents,” from 2003. For a long time, many trade economists had continued to insist that rising imports from developing countries hadn’t played much of a role in the decline of manufacturing employment. But as another five million manufacturing jobs were lost in the years after 2000, and imports from China soared, this position became increasingly difficult to maintain. A 2013 study by David H. Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson found that rising Chinese imports accounted for about a quarter of the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007. A 2014 study by the same three authors and two others, Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price, estimated that between 1999 and 2011, competition from China had caused the loss of 2.4 million jobs—a figure the study said “likely understates the full consequences of the China shock on US employment.”","2091","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"Amid a U.S. economy that includes more than a hundred and forty million jobs, 2.4 million is perhaps not a huge number. But there is also an emerging consensus that globalization and free trade have contributed to the problems of wage declines and income stagnation, which afflict tens of millions of Americans. In 2012, a long survey article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives concluded: “Our analysis sheds new light on the sobering fact of pervasive real-income declines for the large majority of Americans in the past decade. These real-income declines may be part of the same globalization and innovation forces shaping returns to superstars and to capital.”","2092","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"In case that last line went over your head, I’ll translate it into plain English: It could well be that globalization is making the rich richer and most of the U.S. population poorer. No wonder the T.P.P. is in trouble, and why some of those who would be expected to be supporting it are not.","2093","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/r-i-p-free-trade-treaties"
"Bernie Sanders formally announced that he was running for President on May 26, 2015, in a stern thirty-five-minute speech he delivered in Burlington, Vermont, on the green-gray shores of Lake Champlain. But, really, his campaign began nearly five years earlier, on the floor of the Senate, on December 10, 2010, when Sanders spoke—without eating, or sitting down, or taking a bathroom break—for eight and a half hours. The “filiBernie,” people called it—“the most Twittered event in the world on that day,” Sanders wrote later–though it wasn’t, technically, a filibuster, since it wasn’t holding up any vote. “You can call it a very long speech,” the Senator suggested. Or: you could call it a manifesto.","July 9, 2015","2094","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"
"“When I walked on to the floor, I had no idea how long I would stay there,” Sanders explained. At the time, he was sixty-nine. The longest speech he’d ever given, he said, was an hour. He wondered, “Would I last three hours, five hours, twenty hours?” He didn’t have a speech written out, though he had pages, scraps, and notes, and he knew what he wanted to say. He had only one rule: No “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” (“I wasn’t going to read from the phone book or sing songs.”) He figured he’d just riff off bits and pieces of old speeches until he dropped. The idea seems to have been to talk for as long as it would take for people to hear what he had to say. And that, more or less, is his plan for this election, too.","2095","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"
"How long will he last? Sanders, who used to be a long-distance runner, has always said that he intends to run a very long campaign. Up until now, the press hasn’t taken that, or him, seriously. “Who Is Bernie Sanders?” CNN asked, in a video posted to its site in April. Who cares? Was the answer of a lot of pundits in May, and into June. Sanders, though, has been drawing huge crowds. And in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’s steadily gaining ground against Hillary Clinton.

He led sit-ins against segregated housing on campus; he worked for S.N.C.C.; he went to the March on Washington. He graduated with a degree in political science in 1964, the year that Ronald Reagan gave a speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater, called “A Time for Choosing,” that was aired on television the week before Election Day. The choice, Reagan said, was between the Johnson Administration, which Reagan called “socialist” (because of the War on Poverty), and Goldwater, representing the Founding Fathers, who, as Reagan imagined it, knew that “outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.” Among Reagan’s speechwriters, “A Time for Choosing” became known as “The Speech,” since every speech Reagan gave was essentially a version of it. (For more on The Speech, see Robert Schlesinger’s “White House Ghosts: Presidents and Their Speechwriters.”) In 2011, when Bernie Sanders had the transcript of his quasi-filibuster published as a book, he titled that book “The Speech.”","2097","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-long-run"

Sanders isn’t a Debsian socialist; he’s a socialist in the sense that Reagan used that word to describe L.B.J. “He campaigned on the promise of a better life for the working man,” Alan Richman wrote in the Boston Globe. “Nobody seemed to mind that the dream Sanders believes in is called socialism.” He drew the attention of the national press when he ran for reëlection, in 1983. In the Wall Street Journal, for instance, Jane Mayer (who is now at The New Yorker) reported that Sanders began a speech at a fundraiser for the United Way by saying, “I don’t believe in charities.” (He later explained by pointing at the donors: “Most of them were conservative Republicans busy cutting services to low-income people. Then they go collect nickels and dimes, mostly from working people, and congratulate each other on their generosity.

Kick me out of the party?” At the time, the most notable way in which he had bucked the Democratic Party had to do with gun control: Sanders opposed the Brady Bill, which placed regulations on the purchase of handguns, a position that’s come up, lately, now that the press is taking him a bit more seriously. (Sanders said then that he did not believe gun control was a federal matter; more lately, he has said that, as a man who holds a middle ground on the issue, he can broker a compromise.

Among other subjects, he spoke about his big lead in the polls and joked about holding the 2016 election early. “I’d like to have the election tomorrow,” Trump said. “I don’t want to wait.” In another sign of the progress he is making, one of Alabama’s two Republican senators, Jeff Sessions, greeted Trump onstage and praised his tough stance on immigration.","August 22, 2015","2107","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"To say that Trump is flying high would be an understatement. Not only is he crushing his Republican opponents in the polls, many of his critics in the media have thrown in the towel.

"On the day of the rally, USA Today reported, with no evident irony, that Trump and his allies were plotting “a path to victory” in the G.O.P. primaries. The Washington Post said that Trump’s Republican rivals were being forced to adopt new strategies to ride out the “Trump tornado.” And a front-page story in the Boston Globe quoted Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, who said, “What is happening with Trump is not a fluke. Yes, he is a great entertainer, but he is able to take advantage of a number of dynamics in American politics as they exist right now. This is an important moment.”","2109","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"

In any case, setting aside Trump’s ultimate fate, his current position demands explanation. How is he doing it? Here are five vaguely plausible theories that I have seen put forward recently.","2110","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"1. He’s a rich celebrity. “Trump is the personification of a 21st-century America fascinated by the super rich and obsessed with celebrity,” James Pindell wrote in the Globe’s Friday story, citing interviews that he’d conducted with a number of historians. It’s not just that Trump’s ceaseless self-promotion and his role on “The Apprentice” have created a level of name recognition that his rivals can’t hope to match. With his status as a bona-fide celebrity, he can get his message out without having to worry about how it is intermediated by the political press, or about whether he is winning the “invisible primary” for the support of moneyed élites. Indeed, rather than being tested by the media, Trump is exploiting it mercilessly, especially the broadcast media.","2111","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Virtually everywhere you look on cable television there is an “exclusive” Trump interview. Since he draws much higher ratings than any other candidate, he knows the cable networks will keep inviting him on and giving him lengthy prime-time interviews, regardless of what he actually says. (This, surely, was the message of the Megyn Kelly dust-up.) The other candidates are forced to rely on occasional onscreen appearances (the debates, especially) and paid media (that is, advertising)—if they can afford it. The celebrity gulf puts them at an enormous disadvantage, which, for now at least, they are failing to surmount.","2112","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"2. He can’t be bought. As the political success of Michael Bloomberg showed, the idea of a billionaire candidate who doesn’t need to kowtow to vested interests can have considerable appeal to American voters. Trump is a populist version of Bloomberg, and he has no compunctions about pointing out how beholden his opponents are to rich donors—who are largely guys like him. During the first televised G.O.P. debate, he was eager to say that he had contributed to the past campaigns of many of his rivals in the full expectation of receiving something in return. He also claimed, effectively, to have paid Hillary Clinton to appear at his wedding. This wasn’t just boasting: it was exploiting his unique position to the maximum.","2113","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Given the widespread belief among voters that most politicians have been hopelessly corrupted by the demands of fund-raising, Trump’s appeal isn’t necessarily confined to ultra-conservatives. Appearing on the Fox Business Network recently, Ralph Nader, the longtime crusader against money in politics, who has mounted two Presidential campaigns as an independent and two as the Green Party nominee, called Trump “a breath of fresh air.” “The two-party tyranny that blocks voter choices and dominates the political scene on behalf of big business needs to be broken up and Trump is the one to do it. It takes a billionaire,” he said. When even someone with Nader’s progressive credentials is making this argument, is it any wonder many other Americans find it attractive?","2114","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"3. G.O.P. voters like his policies. When Trump accuses the Mexican government of sending its criminals to the United States and talks about deporting millions of undocumented workers en masse, many commentators, myself included, see him as engaging in misleading, impractical rabble-rousing. But, as I pointed out earlier this week, the demagoguery is working. Trump isn’t merely matching the more conservative Republican candidates on the immigration issue: he’s beating them. In arecent CNN poll, forty-four per cent of likely Republican voters picked Trump as the candidate who could best handle illegal immigration. (Jeb Bush came in second, with just twelve per cent.)","2115","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"And immigration isn’t the sole issue on which Trump’s views are striking a chord. His tough-on-trade rhetoric resonates with G.O.P. voters, particularly middle-income and low-income white men. Indeed, a recent survey by Pew Research suggested that Republicans, as a group, are now more skeptical of trade agreements, such as the new Trans-Pacific Partnership, than the Democrats are. As Newsweek’s Matt Cooper pointed out in a prescient piece back in June, Trump largely has this issue to himself. Dependent as they are on corporate money, most Republican candidates—from Jeb Bush to Marco Rubio to Scott Walker to Ted Cruz—support trade agreements. Trump, by contrast, is free to take a populist line, which he is doing with great enthusiasm.","2116","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"4. He’s the rider on a white horse. On the radio a while back, I heard Pat Buchanan, who ran for President as a conservative insurgent twice in the nineteen-nineties, and again in 2000, compare Trump to Huey Long, the legendary Louisiana populist who assailed the rich, the corporations, and the metropolitan élites during the twenties and thirties. Like Long, Trump could speak to ordinary folk in a language that they could understand and relate to, Buchanan said. Long was a Democrat, of course, who espoused some policies—such as expanded public services, stricter regulation of business, and higher taxes on the rich—that Trump, in his current incarnation, might well dismiss as socialism. But there still might be something to the comparison. Long “spoke so directly to the people, and that is Donald Trump’s appeal,” Richard D. White, the author of “Kingfish: The Reign of Huey P. Long,” told the Boston Globe. “It is a purely personal relationship with his listeners. It is not based on factual issues.”","2117","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"Of course, the divide between populism and demagoguery is often in the eye of the beholder. White, who is now the dean of E.J. Ourso College of Business, at Louisiana State University, highlighted Trump and Long’s penchants for dressing in fancy suits and using incendiary language toward minorities. “The oversimplification of issues is very dangerous, and when you combine that with negativity and fear, the combination is classic populism,” he said. At least one Republican, Frank Luntz, the pollster and strategist, has also suggested that Trump’s candidacy could be dangerous. “There’s something happening out there that is profound, but you gotta be careful; when you tap into it you better have a way to direct it,” Luntz told Politico. “Trump has tapped into it. Bernie Sanders has tapped into it and they’re doing well, but you’re tapping into fire—that’s how hot the anger is. We are in a dangerous political environment that requires a higher standard for the candidates running. It requires them not just to stoke the anger, it’s already there. It requires them to provide the balm of solutions.”","2118","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"5. He’s just a summer diversion. Asked about Trump’s performance in the televised debate and his subsequent comments about Megyn Kelly, Hillary Clinton said, “It’s all entertainment. I think he’s having the time of his life, being up on that stage, saying whatever he wants to say.” Despite Trump’s comments about why she attended his wedding, Clinton is doubtless enjoying the sight of him toying with his Republican rivals, one of whom she may well end up running against. But she also raised a serious point. These days, Presidential campaigns are ludicrously long and bloated. Is there anyone, faced with the prospect of another year and a half of focus-group-tested politicking, who wasn’t secretly (or not so secretly) a bit relieved that Trump entered the fray and provided a diversion?","2119","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"
"In a column published on the Cook Political Report earlier this week, Amy Walter compared the G.O.P. electorate’s embrace of Trump to a post-college summer fling. “The summer before a presidential election year is a lot like dating in your early 20s. You are unattached and care-free. You want to connect with someone passionately and fall hopelessly in love,” she wrote. “Meanwhile, your parents want you to meet a guy like Jeb Bush.” No wonder G.O.P. voters are dallying with Trump, Walters added. He’s “everything your parents hate. He’s loud. He’s disrespectful. He probably smokes and drives a motorcycle. But, you don’t care.” Eventually, though, you settle down with the responsible guy.","2120","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/five-theories-of-donald-trump"

The d.j. rebuffed her, and in the days that followed she and her allies took to social media to voice their dissatisfaction, suggesting that the pub was promoting “rape culture.” Before long, Fitzgerald’s conceded defeat, apologizing to the patron on Facebook and promising that “Blurred Lines” would not be played there again and that the offending d.j. would never be invited back.","2124","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"This was a small story, but something about it resonated: an account in the student paper, the Daily Tar Heel, was picked up by an irreverent site called Barstool Sports, which expressed its certainty that the complaining student was a “crazy ass feminist” who hated fun, and then by Yahoo News. The same month, Brendan Eich, the C.E.O. of the software company Mozilla, was forced to resign after critics discovered that he had donated a thousand dollars to supporters of Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot initiative to ban same-sex marriage in California. And when Dan Cathy, the president of the fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, voiced his own opposition to same-sex marriage, in 2012, two big-city mayors—Rahm Emanuel, in Chicago, and Thomas Menino, in Boston—suggested that new Chick-fil-A restaurants would be unwelcome in their cities. Both later clarified that they would not block any of the company’s expansion plans.

"“Is this the type of country we want to live in?” That is the question posed by Mary Katharine Ham and Guy Benson, a pair of waggish conservative commentators, as they ponder the fate of the d.j. who got fired for playing “Blurred Lines.” They are the authors of a new book titled “End of Discussion: How the Left’s Outrage Industry Shuts Down Debate, Manipulates Voters, and Makes America Less Free (and Fun).” They argue that what might seem like hypersensitivity is actually a form of political combat. Borrowing from the language of soccer, they write, “America is turning into a country of floppers, figuratively grabbing our shins in fabricated agony over every little possible offense in hopes of working the refs.” Kirsten Powers, a liberal—though a heterodox one—and a Fox News pundit, delivers an even starker verdict in “The Silencing: How the Left Is Killing Free Speech.” She detects, among those she might once have considered ideological allies, “an aggressive, illiberal impulse to silence people,” which often takes the form of meta-intolerance—that is, intolerance of any view that is judged to be intolerant.","2126","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Half a century ago, the defense of free speech was closely identified with groups like the Free Speech Movement, a confederation of activists who came together at the University of California, Berkeley, after a student was arrested for setting up a table of civil-rights literature, in defiance of anti-solicitation rules. Defending free speech meant defending Lenny Bruce and Abbie Hoffman, and, later, Larry Flynt, Robert Mapplethorpe, and the 2 Live Crew. In a 1990 public-service announcement, Madonna, wearing red lingerie and an American flag, delivered a civics lesson, in verse: “Dr. King, Malcolm X / Freedom of speech is as good as sex.” She was urging young people to vote, in partnership with Rock the Vote, whose slogan was “Censorship is Un-American.”","2127","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"But as the nineteen-nineties progressed, fights over obscenity subsided and fights over so-called political correctness intensified; “free speech” became a different kind of rallying cry, especially on college campuses. Often, “free speech” meant not the right to protest a war but the right to push back against campus restrictions designed to shield marginalized groups from, say, “racial and ethnic harassment”—that was the term used by Central Michigan University, in its speech code, which banned “demeaning” expressions. The campus speech wars have since grown broader but vaguer, and many prominent recent incidents, like the “Blurred Lines” dispute, don’t involve legal claims. Instead, there are open letters and social-media campaigns, rescinded invitations and cancelled events. Young people who might, a generation earlier, have sided with the 2 Live Crew now ask to be delivered from Robin Thicke. Powers, in her book, accuses fellow-liberals of having switched sides. “Liberals are supposed to believe in diversity, which should include diversity of thought and belief,” she writes. This is a rather paradoxical formulation. (Is it possible to believe in diversity of belief?) But then the current free-speech debate is rather paradoxical, too—it can be hard to tell the speakers from the censors.","2128","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"The freedom of speech promised by the First Amendment has fluctuating limits—in general, elected politicians want more, and unelected ones (that is, judges) want fewer. In 1919, the Supreme Court ruled that speech could be regulated only if it presented “a clear and present danger,” and then, more narrowly, in 1969, only if it was likely to incite “imminent lawless action.” Each of these cases concerned a political protest: a socialist anti-conscription flyer, in the first, and a speech by a Klansman, in the second. Courts have generally allowed exceptions only for “content-neutral” regulations that restrict how people may speak, not what they can say. When private business or government funding is involved, the legal lines are more tangled. For decades, the Federal Communications Commission attempted to insure balanced news coverage with its fairness doctrine, which compelled broadcasters to present “discussion of conflicting views of public importance.” And when disputes arise on campus, courts typically distinguish between public institutions, which are bound by the First Amendment, and private ones, which may retain stronger rights to set their own rules.","2129","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"For many modern free-speech advocates, the First Amendment is irrelevant: their main target is not repressive laws but shifting norms and values. In “End of Discussion,” Ham and Benson argue that the real problem is the politicization of everyday life. “Grievance mongering, apology demanding, and scalp collecting are modeled at the national level by ruthless professionals,” they write, “then replicated straight on down the line.” In their view, the effect of all this complaining is “an insidious strain of self-censorship” among regular folks. Ham and Benson have the requisite stories to tell, including a picturesque episode involving a Minnesota university that arranged to bring a camel to campus, as a stress-relief treatment, only to cancel the appearance after protests; one student explained online that “camels are associated with stereotypes that reinforce harmful Western (read: white) perceptions of Arab people.” What Ham and Benson want is to reënergize “the rich American tradition of a loud, raucous, messy, free speech free-for-all,” complete with camels and lecherous pop songs. It is this vision of how we should speak to one another—and not an abstract belief in the right to speak—that animates their book.","2130","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Ham and Benson, conservatives striving to be evenhanded, describe hostility to free speech as a sickness to which both conservatives and liberals are susceptible, even though, in their judgment, conservatives have a stronger immune system. Powers, revelling in her status as a liberal speaking truth to the liberal powers that be, makes a more partisan case, and in some ways a more convincing one. She is battling an underlying ideology, one essential to modern liberalism: a belief that we have an urgent duty not merely to fight discrimination but to signal our disapproval of those who support it. Her examples include Voice for Life, a pro-life group that was initially denied recognition by the student government of Johns Hopkins University, partly out of concern that its “sidewalk counselling” sessions could be considered harassment of women.","2131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Like Ham and Benson, Powers struggles to find worthy sparring partners. There is no advocacy group or high-profile politician avowedly devoted to the cause of cracking down on political speech, no national spokesperson for the war on camels. So the authors are forced to argue with evanescent Facebook groups or obscure junior faculty members or young people who had the misfortune to be quoted in the college newspaper. No doubt many liberals have grown increasingly sensitive to the uses and abuses of language. This might be a consequence of previously marginalized groups demanding respect, or it might have something to do with technological change, as the atomized Internet age gives way to the non-stop commentary of the social-media age. And it may be the case that this focus on language will prove, in the long run, unhelpful to the progressive movement. But it is hard to see how, as Powers argues, “the left is killing free speech” merely by paying too much attention to it. Last month, speaking about criminal-justice reform, President Obama issued twin exhortations. “We should not be tolerating rape in prison,” he said. “And we shouldn’t be making jokes about it in our popular culture.” To someone like Powers, this might have sounded faintly oppressive: the President telling citizens what jokes not to tell. Yet our discourse is shaped by innumerable taboos. (Just think of all the things one shouldn’t say about members of the military.) Certainly, some new taboos are emerging, even as some older ones fade away, but no one with Internet access will find it easy to claim that, in general, our speech is more inhibited than it used to be. Taboos discourage some speech, but the system of taboos is also maintained through speech. If you say the unsayable, you might well be shamed—and that shaming can have consequences—but you will not be arrested. Mostly, what inhibits speech is the fear of being spoken about.","2132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Earlier this year, Powers took part in a debate over the proposition that “liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus.” One of the people on the other side was Angus Johnston, a historian of student activism. He cited the case of Robert J. Birgeneau, the former chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, who was invited to deliver the commencement address at Haverford College last year, but declined in the face of protests; students had demanded that he apologize for the actions of U.C.B. police officers who arrested seven students during a 2011 demonstration. Powers considers Birgeneau the victim of a “campaign of intolerance,” but Johnston sees him as a perpetrator. “Birgeneau, an administrator who presided over the beating and arrest of student protesters, is portrayed as a free-speech martyr,” he said. “The students who just wanted to talk to him about that are portrayed as his oppressors.” Johnston conceded that “stifling” was worrisome, but insisted that the true culprits were administrators—liberal, perhaps, in political outlook, but motivated merely by “opposition to disruptiveness and clamor.” These days, just about everyone claims to be on the side of free speech.","2133","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Two decades ago, the argument was more even. On one side were conservative advocates like Dinesh D’Souza, who, in his 1991 best-seller “Illiberal Education,” denounced what he called “the new censorship.” On the other side were liberal scholars willing to question both the cultural norms and the legal traditions underlying free-speech claims. In 1993, the legal scholar Cass Sunstein published “Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech,” which argued that the First Amendment was meant to protect “democratic deliberation.” With that goal in mind, he wrote, the government might justifiably act to promote healthy debate, as the F.C.C. did with its fairness doctrine, or to ban corrosive and nonpolitical speech, such as violent pornography. The so-called marketplace of ideas was, just like any other market, imperfect, and could similarly be improved by careful government intervention.","2134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Stanley Fish, the literary scholar, had even more fundamental objections to free-speech rhetoric. His mischievous contribution to the debate, published the next year, was “There’s No Such Thing as Free Speech: And It’s a Good Thing, Too,” which argued that free expression was no one’s “primary value.” On college campuses, for instance, the core educational mission routinely trumps students’ rights to express themselves. (Rules against plagiarism and disruptive behavior are both, in a sense, campus speech regulations.) Free speech, in Fish’s unsentimental account, was a “political prize,” a tag awarded by politically powerful groups to whatever forms of expression they approved of. And since all meaningful speech existed within a community, where it was shaped by what he called “productive constraint,” alarmist warnings about creeping political correctness were absurd. The question of whether to regulate so-called “hate speech” was “no more or less difficult than the question of whether spectators at a trial can applaud or boo the statements of opposing counsels.”","2135","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"In the years since, restrictive campus speech codes have been widely repealed, which is why modern free-speech advocates are often left to battle less draconian forms of censorship, like cancelled commencement addresses. Sunstein’s and Fish’s books now seem radical—but only in America, which is virtually the only place in the world that takes such an expansive view of free speech. (The U.S. is one of a handful of countries that refuse to honor a United Nations convention calling for laws against “dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred.”) In this respect, the First Amendment has something in common with the Second Amendment, which secures the right to “keep and bear arms”: both are unusually broad legal guarantees that mark a difference between America and the rest of the world.","2136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Perhaps it is no coincidence that one of the most influential free-speech skeptics in America today is an immigrant. Jeremy Waldron is a law professor from New Zealand who teaches at New York University. In 2012, he published “The Harm in Hate Speech,” a powerful little book that seeks to dismantle familiar defenses of the right to indefensible speech. Waldron is unimpressed by the “liberal bravado” of free-speech advocates who say, “I hate what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” In his view, the people who say this rarely feel threatened by the speech they say they hate. Unfettered political expression came to seem like a bedrock American value only in the twentieth century, when the government no longer feared radical pamphleteers.","2137","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"This, in essence, was Justice Holmes’s rationale, in 1919, when he argued in an influential dissent that antiwar anarchists should be free to agitate. “Nobody can suppose that the surreptitious publishing of a silly leaflet by an unknown man, without more, would present any immediate danger,” he wrote. Free-speech advocates typically claim that the value of unfettered expression outweighs any harm it might cause, offering assurances that any such harm will be minimal. But what makes them so sure? America’s free-speech regime is shot through with exceptions, including civil (and, in some states, criminal) laws against libel. By what rationale do we insist that groups—races, communities of faith—don’t deserve similar protection? Waldron uses the term “hate speech” in a particular sense, to denote not speech that expresses hatred but speech likely to inspire it. If we want a society that recognizes the dignity of marginalized groups, he argues, then we should be willing to enact “laws that prohibit the mobilization of social forces to exclude them.” This would involve carving out an exception to the First Amendment. But there are plenty of exceptions already, and taken together they form a rough portrait of what we value and what we don’t.","2138","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Many free-speech arguments turn on a deceptively simple question: what is speech? It’s clear that the protected category excludes all sorts of statements. (The First Amendment will be of no use to someone who writes a fraudulent contract, or who says, “Hand over your wallet and iPhone,” and means it.) But judges have also agreed that some forms of speech are more important than others, and therefore more protected. They sometimes talk about “expressive conduct,” which can seem like another way of saying “useless speech”: utterances that do little more than disclose a point of view. When speech serves a clear purpose, we tend to call it something else.","2139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"One example is political advertising; its apparent efficacy is precisely the reason that some reformers want to limit it. In the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court considered the case of a conservative political group, Citizens United, that wanted to broadcast and advertise a documentary critical of Hillary Clinton, who was then a senator and a Presidential candidate. The F.E.C. viewed the film as an improper “electioneering communication.” The Court ruled against the F.E.C., declaring that “prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on speech.” Citizens United was probably the most consequential free-speech ruling of the modern era, although its detractors would say that it wasn’t about free speech at all. (Powers has said that she disagrees with the Citizens United decision, which explains why she wrote a book about free speech without mentioning it.) Earlier this year, on the first day of her current Presidential campaign, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to get “unaccountable money” out of politics, as a response to the Citizens United decision. For opponents of the decision, it is awkward, to say the least, that their leading ally is the same politician whom the plaintiffs’ film sought to criticize.","2140","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Waldron argues that hate speech could, in theory, be very consequential, and therefore a proper target for regulation. His book, which is rigorous, if rather cool-blooded, has little to say on the subject of how these harms actually occur. It begins with the hypothetical example of a Muslim father who sees a sign that shows a picture of Muslim children along with the words “They are all called Osama.” Waldron’s point is that such signs would constitute an assault on the dignity and the status of Muslims in America. (A British man who displayed similar signs in his window was sentenced to a year in prison, for “religiously aggravated harassment.”) But Waldron doesn’t succeed in showing that such a provocation really would undermine civil society. He cites the same hoary examples that have shaped recent jurisprudence: neo-Nazis marching through an Illinois town, far-flung Klansmen and their crosses. Waldron would be more persuasive if he had more to say about newer forms of hate speech, which tend to be more personal—and possibly more damaging.","2141","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Who was the d.j. that night at Fitzgerald’s? In “End of Discussion,” Ham and Benson say they tried and failed to identify him; they call him “some dude who was just trying to pay his bills by spinning records.” The complaining student, on the other hand, has been named in numerous accounts of the incident, including Ham and Benson’s, and, as a result, she has become the target of online vituperation. More than a year after the incident, a Google search for her name brings up, on the first page, a comment thread titled “EataDICK dumbcunt.” We live in a world, evidently, where a college-town d.j. who plays a popular song can inspire a Facebook protest that will eventually cost him his gig. But we also live in a world where an undergraduate who protests at her local bar can find herself vilified around the world, achieving the sort of Internet infamy that will eventually fade but never entirely dissipate.

"Perhaps America’s First Amendment, like the Second, is ultimately a matter of national preference. In Britain, Twitter users have been jailed for sending abusive tweets; in France, Twitter was compelled to help a prosecutor identify pseudonymous users accused of sending anti-Semitic tweets. But legislators in this country have had a harder time outlawing online harassment. Last year, Arizona enacted a law aimed at curbing so-called “revenge porn,” the popular term for sharing naked or sexual images of people without their consent. The American Civil Liberties Union sued, calling the law overly broad, because it could have been used to imprison anyone who shared the Abu Ghraib photographs, or the ruinous self-portraits of Anthony Weiner, the former congressman. In a settlement, Arizona agreed not to enforce it.","2143","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Speech nuts, like gun nuts, have amassed plenty of arguments, but they—we—are driven, too, by a shared sensibility that can seem irrational by European standards. And, just as good-faith gun-rights advocates don’t pretend that every gun owner is a third-generation hunter, free-speech advocates need not pretend that every provocative utterance is a valuable contribution to a robust debate, or that it is impossible to make any distinctions between various kinds of speech. In the case of online harassment, that instinctive preference for “free speech” may already be shaping the kinds of discussions we have, possibly by discouraging the participation of women, racial and sexual minorities, and anyone else likely to be singled out for ad-hominem abuse. Some kinds of free speech really can be harmful, and people who want to defend it anyway should be willing to say so.","2144","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"On social media, the posts are often public, but the forum itself is decidedly not. Most of the time, disputes about online harassment are handled not by government investigators but by administrators from the small number of companies that dominate social media. We are outsourcing some of our most important free-speech decisions to these sites, which must do what the First Amendment often prevents government from doing, at least explicitly: balance the value of free speech against other, competing values. Earlier this year, a journalist named Lindy West wrote about the many ways she has been harassed online: she said that just about every day someone calls her “a fat bitch (or some pithy variation thereof)”; one particularly enterprising foe apparently created a satirical Twitter account in the voice of West’s father, who had recently died. In the aftermath, Dick Costolo, the C.E.O. of Twitter, conceded, “We suck at dealing with abuse.” A few months later, Twitter announced that it would begin allowing users to report abuse even if they weren’t the targets, and that it would require users suspected of harassment to provide their phone numbers, to make it harder for people banned from the site to re-register. Compared with a jail sentence, the threat of account termination may seem mild. But, as social networks grow more powerful, online erasure may come to seem more intimidating.

The Constitution, as currently interpreted, seems to offer little help in fostering the kinds of conversations they believe to be so vital. It’s not hard to imagine a time, not long from now, when advocates decide that more proactive measures are needed in order to protect our speech rights online. Imagine a law written to make sure that controversial users—pastors dedicated to “curing” gay people, say, or activists reproducing the Charlie Hebdo images of the Prophet Muhammad—wouldn’t be blocked or suspended by social-media networks merely for speaking out.","2146","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"When government officials tell a private corporation to allow citizens to speak, are they upholding the First Amendment or flouting it? That was the question that President Reagan considered in 1987, when Congress moved to enshrine the fairness doctrine, arguing that it was necessary to “ensure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources.” Reagan vetoed the bill, and delivered a stern statement explaining why. He said that government had no business telling radio and television stations what kinds of political discussions they should broadcast. Any effort in that direction would be “antagonistic to the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.” In his view, robust debate was important—but free speech was more important still. ♦","2147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/the-hell-you-say"
"Donald Trump’s lead among the Republican candidates for President continues to be the strangest thing about the latest polls—about American politics, in general. But what may be more consequential is that, in some polls, Jeb Bush, the supposed front-runner, isn’t in second place; he’s in third, behind Scott Walker. The numbers have been close, often with just a percentage point between them (fourteen per cent for Bush, fifteen for Walker, nineteen for Trump, in a Wall Street Journal poll released Monday), and, in a Fox News poll released Tuesday, Bush gained ground (fifteen per cent to Walker’s nine, and Trump’s twenty-six). With the lift from the Fox numbers, the Real Clear Politics average has Bush ahead of Walker by about two points, which is within the margin of error. But a tie is a loss for Bush. He has drawn in a hundred and twenty million dollars in campaign funds—about ninety million more than Walker has. Bush should be beating him and Trump; he should be beating everybody. Instead, he goes into the first debate Thursday night with the risk that Trump will make him petulant and the other candidates will make him look soft and privileged. With that setup, Walker could win the debate.","August 4, 2015","2148","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"Could he win the nomination? The problem with a money lead like Bush’s is that, in the post-Citizens United system, money can be raised, in large quantities, very, very quickly. A candidate no longer needs the infrastructure of veteran bundlers who will round up twenty-seven-hundred-dollar checks from hundreds of people. There can be one big check—written to a Super PAC, rather than a campaign, but that’s stopped making much of a difference. A Times analysis found that, so far, just a hundred and thirty individuals or families have given half the money for Republican candidates. According to the paper, “At least $13.5 million of the $20 million raised by Mr. Walker’s super PAC came from just four donors.” Diane Hendricks, of Wisconsin, described as a “roofing billionaire,” gave five million. Bush, until now, has been the beneficiary of the dutiful G.O.P. money, from the donors who are simply going to be there for the Party’s candidate, and think that it’s going to be him. But, if there’s doubt, he’ll have to share the wealth.","2149","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"Walker is looking for it. This weekend, he was at a retreat for Freedom Partners, a network associated with David and Charles Koch, in Southern California, to answer questions before an audience of big donors. So were, by invitation, Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Carly Fiorina. (Trump, who wasn’t, said that the others had gone to “beg,” and wished them good luck with that.) When the moderator, Mike Allen, of Politico, asked if Walker was intimidated by the amount of money that Bush had raised, he said, “He’s done a good job with connections to the family. And that’s great.”","2150","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"That reply suggests another possible move for Walker, when it comes to differentiating himself from Bush. He is the regular guy, not the son and the brother of a President. In the debate Thursday night, Trump might well make that point for him, either with an outright insult or a reminder that Bush, even with his name and his institutional support, hasn’t been able to close the deal. (The irony of Trump having been born into wealth is not likely to slow down Trump.) Bush went to Andover and then graduated from the University of Texas, and before he became governor of Florida he had a business career that can make him look like a meandering trader in influence. Walker dropped out of Marquette University, worked briefly in marketing for a local Red Cross chapter, and then, when he was still in his twenties, went into politics. He doesn’t have a college degree. If a Clinton is running against a Bush, the dynastic complaint is cancelled out. The dynamic of a confrontation between Scott Walker and Hillary Clinton would be markedly different, and perhaps more dangerous for Clinton.","2151","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"Walker is best known for his systematic efforts, as the governor of Wisconsin, to destroy labor unions. These have gone well beyond haggling over the terms of contracts for state employees to a dismantling of the mechanisms of collective bargaining in both the public and the private sector. (Dan Kaufman wrote recently in the Times Magazine about how Walker succeeded in getting anti-union measures passed with an approach that the governor himself described as “divide and conquer”—something that could be useful with the overcrowded Republican field.)","2152","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"His ability to pass “right to work” legislation in Wisconsin, and his promise to do so on a federal level, is a draw for conservatives. But it’s a hard call as to whether the Koch circle is more drawn to that or to his resistance to environmental regulations, particularly those aimed at the fossil-fuel industry, and his contempt for efforts to limit climate change. (The Kochs’ network is not endorsing a primary candidate, but David Koch has said that he leans toward Walker, and the brothers have financially supported his campaigns for governor.) Summing up Walker’s environmental record, Vox noted, almost with awe, that he “doesn’t even like recycling.”","2153","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"
"At the Koch event, when Walker was asked if he thought that President Obama was a Christian, he said, “I don’t know.” He has said this before, qualifying it only with a willingness to “presume” that Obama is not lying when he says that he is a Christian. The appeal to Tea Partiers and birthers is not subtle. Walker has also spoken out against marriage equality, despite his own children’s views to the contrary and the marriage of a family member to another woman. He told reporters that he attended the reception, but stayed away from the ceremony.","2154","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/after-trump-can-walker-win"

"Walker’s comparing supporters of American labor with Islamist terrorists generated so much mockery that his even more alarming stated commitment to a broadly conceived interventionist policy (“here or anywhere in the world”) got less attention than it should have. But the comparison wasn’t a gaffe; it was Walker’s conception of history. William Finnegan, in a Profile of Walker in The New Yorker, quoted his comments on Ronald Reagan’s destruction of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization: “That was the first crack in the Berlin Wall and the fall of Communism, because from that point forward the Soviets and the Communists knew that Ronald Reagan wasn’t a pushover.” As PATCO falls, so falls the Soviet empire. Trump is not the only Republican candidate with an odd sense of scale, or lack of perspective. There are many absurdities still to be wagered with in this race.

This might encourage a certain discipline. The members of each side would be reminded that what distinguishes them from one another is less important than what distinguishes them from the members of the other side. Nobody would want to be the one whose jab at a teammate provides an opportunity for real-time gloating by the other side. (“I have to agree with Mr. Chafee about Secretary Clinton’s scandalous speech fees.” “Senator Rubio said it better than I could about Jeb Bush’s mediocre record in Florida.”) Everyone on the stage would have to be conscious of an electorate beyond his or her own party’s base. All would have to demonstrate an ability to handle challenges from those who differ from them in ways that go beyond the details of their own party’s ideological orthodoxy.

The subject was Senator Rand Paul, who last fall was hailed by Time as “The Most Interesting Man in Politics,” but now seems, in the estimation of Politico, to be the most interesting man who’s struggling to stay in the Republican primary. A recent CNN/ORC poll found him tied with Ted Cruz for fifth place in the field, with support from only six per cent of those polled, behind Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio. An NBC/Marist poll found him in sixth place in Iowa, and in ninth place in New Hampshire.","July 31, 2015","2168","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Last fall, Rand Paul seemed like a less quirky—and therefore, perhaps, more electable—version of his father, the former Congressman Ron Paul, whose 2008 and 2012 campaigns for the Republican Presidential nomination were grand cultural phenomena. Ron Paul toured the country, telling Republican voters things you might think they wouldn’t want to hear. In the 2012 primary, he finished in second place, behind Mitt Romney, in New Hampshire, with 22.8 per cent of the vote. Four years later, one poll has Ron Paul’s less recalcitrant son at only four per cent. The Web site FiveThirtyEight points out that, nationwide, Rand Paul’s support is currently lower than his father’s was at this point in 2012.","2169","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"What went wrong? There is no shortage of explanations, partly because contemporary politics has no shortage of professional explainers. The Politico story claimed that Paul is “allergic” to buttering up big donors, and suggested that his campaign is chaotic. (It included a particularly vivid anecdote about a near-physical altercation between Paul’s campaign manager and a member of his security staff, who was described as a “a 280-pound retired New York police detective and Paul family loyalist.”) Paul himself told a reporter for the Boston Globe that one of the obstacles he faced was a crowded Republican field. “Obviously, everybody’s numbers come down when you divide it many different ways,” he said.","2170","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"None of this quite explains Paul’s collapse, especially considering that some polls from last summer put him in the lead. Writing in this magazine last year, Ryan Lizza traced Paul’s incomplete journey from an idea-driven libertarian—he once supported the legalization of all drugs, and argued that a free society should tolerate “unofficial, private discrimination”—to an elected politician more willing to consider the exigencies of party loyalty. After Mitt Romney lost to Obama in 2012, many voices in the Republican Party were calling for a change, and the official G.O.P. post-election report warned that “public perception of the Party is at record lows.” This seemed like an opening for a nonconformist such as Paul.","2171","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"In 2012, Paul opposed the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a government corporation that loans money to foreign customers of U.S. companies. He said it was absurd for the government to borrow money from overseas while also loaning money to foreign companies, and he was one of twenty Senators who voted against its reauthorization. Since then, the anti-Ex-Im movement has grown, and what was once considered a fringe movement celebrated a triumph when the Bank’s charter expired on the last day of June this year. Then, this past Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved to revive the Bank, angering many of his fellow Republicans. Senator Ted Cruz, another Presidential candidate, accused McConnell of having told a “flat-out lie” by denying, at a lunch meeting, that he had a secret plan to revive the Ex-Im Bank. Cruz, canny as always, probably calculated that his blunt language would get him plenty of press, and he was right. (The effort to revive the bank seems to have failed.)","2172","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Paul, by contrast, has forged a strategic relationship with McConnell, who also happens to be Kentucky’s other Senator, and his eagerness to argue against the Ex-Im Bank suddenly seemed to have cooled. Late on Friday afternoon, during a radio interview, Sean Hannity asked Paul about Cruz’s claims. “I wasn’t at that lunch,” Paul said, executing a rather inelegant pivot. “But what I can tell you is that there’s a disconnect—conservatives want to vote on defunding Planned Parenthood.” Paul often wants to talk about defunding Planned Parenthood, these days, and while primary voters surely agree with his position, it doesn’t much distinguish him from the rest of his Republican competitors. (Bush, Rubio, and Walker also support defunding.)","2173","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"So what makes Paul stand out? For a time, one of his signature issues was opposition to the National Security Agency’s bulk data-collection practices, but the issue grew muddier in June, with the passage of the USA Freedom Act, which ruled that data would be collected by telecommunications companies, instead of by the government; Paul considered this a very partial victory, and he delivered a long and equivocal speech expressing his mixed feelings. Paul’s interest in criminal-justice reform once marked him as an unorthodox Republican, but an increasing number of Republicans are now talking about changing the way we fight crime. On national security, Paul used to be skeptical about the need to confront regimes deemed hostile—last fall, he parted company with many Republicans by calling for “an effective diplomatic solution for limiting the Iranian enrichment program.” But when the Obama Administration announced its nuclear deal with Iran, Paul joined his Republican rivals in calling it “unacceptable.” Finally, Paul has failed to establish himself as the candidate of Silicon Valley, which is often described as a libertarian-friendly community. The Politico story explained how Paul has failed, so far, to cultivate fruitful relationships there. And when Hillary Clinton suggested we ask “hard questions” about the “gig economy” typified by companies such as Uber, Paul responded with acerbic tweets—only to be upstaged by Bush, a few days later, who used Uber to visit a start-up in San Francisco.","2174","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"Some of the people who should be most enthusiastic about Paul’s Presidential campaign have found themselves disheartened by it. Last week, Nick Gillespie, the editor-in-chief of the libertarian site reason.com, laid out the many un-libertarian things Paul has done and said. He called his campaign “doubly frustrating”—that is, neither principled nor successful. Maybe Paul would always have struggled to win over Republican primary voters. And maybe, during the gruelling months to come, he will rebound and, like a number of candidates in 2012, have a moment near the front of the pack.","2175","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"
"But whatever happens, potential supporters like Gillespie shouldn’t be so disappointed. Even as his campaign struggles, many of his issues are doing surprisingly well—in fact, that’s a big part of the reason why Paul has struggled to define himself. The formerly indomitable Ex-Im bank has been vanquished, though perhaps it will return in another form; the N.S.A. has been reformed, though lightly; a “diplomatic solution” seems imminent in Iran, though of course people disagree about its effectiveness; criminal-justice reform has bipartisan momentum, though it may yet meet with resistance; politicians wishing to hamper companies like Uber are meeting stiff resistance, though they will keep trying. These are all tentative, partial, and temporary victories—but then, politics rarely offers any other kind. Rand Paul is struggling in the polls, but Paulism looks pretty healthy. That’s not good news for the Presidential candidate, but it’s also not such bad news for the guy who may still be, come 2017, a Senator from Kentucky.","2176","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-is-rand-paul-winning-the-issues-but-losing-the-election"

Considered by more conventional measures—and recent polling data notwithstanding—Trump stands almost no chance of gaining the Republican nomination, or ascending to the Presidency if he did. His is a campaign of vanity, of the sort that suggests an inversion of Sherman’s dictum: if he campaigns he shall not be nominated, if nominated he shall not win. This does not mean that his campaign is without significance. Trump has attacked a number of targets in his embryonic candidacy—China, Mexican immigrants, Hillary Clinton—but his most personal grudge appears to be against euphemism. He does not bother to sheath his protectionist urges in pablum about competitiveness, preferring prosecutorial accusation of trade infringement. His gaseous bigotry toward Mexicans who cross the border illegally traffics in unrefined stereotypes, not the language of “fairness” to those immigrants who wait their turn.

By comparison, Trump’s money is presented as wealth qua wealth; it abides by him like one of his handlers, ever present, just beyond the camera’s eye, eternally ready to do his bidding. This kind of ostentation looks gauche to Americans who’ve been financially secure long enough to be embarrassed by it, but it also underscores an elemental fact about the billionaire upstart: in all the ways that matter, save actual performing, Donald Trump is a not a politician—he’s a rapper.

He is the only person in the 2016 Republican field to have appeared both in a commercial endorsing the Wu Tang Clan and the Russell Simmons episode of “Behind the Music.” Trump’s combativeness and overt egomania may induce cringes in the G.O.P. establishment, but this is precisely the behavior we expect—nay, demand—from hip-hop artists. Ditto his tendency to accessorize with beautiful women, a habit that surely motivated his purchase of the Miss Universe pageant. This was not simply a means of burnishing his public appeal by proximity to beauty but also a brilliant means of monetizing male insecurity in a way that has long been painfully apparent within hip-hop culture. Moreover, he’s the only Presidential aspirant with his own clothing line, an atypical venture among real-estate magnates but a virtual requisite for the brand-conscious music impresario—Jay-Z, Diddy, Russell Simmons—looking to diversify his revenue and tastemaking opportunities.

Taken in sum, those dynamics explain why, in the years before he lapsed into birtherism (and found himself lanced—in hip-hop parlance, ethered—by President Obama at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner), Trump, despite his leaden bigotry and general aura of buffoonishness, enjoyed a certain cachet among what might be thought of as a hip-hop demographic. (This was itself notable given that, in 1989, he’d taken out a full-page ad demanding that New York State reinstate the death penalty for the five teenagers charged in the infamous Central Park Five rape case. They were later found to have been wrongfully convicted.) He associated with Diddy and Mike Tyson. His public performance of gleeful affluence seemed to confirm that Trump, despite being born wealthy, embraced the nouveau-riche dictum that there was no point to having money if you had to then be subtle about it. His enduring presence as a figure of public interest is directly tied to the way he offers an aspirational identity that appeals, in particular, to working-class men. (His three million Twitter followers are almost certainly not drawn to him as a standard-bearer of trademark enforcement.) How different is his brand of aspirational identity politics from the story of the Republican Party in the past forty years? His unleavened xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments are controversial but not substantially different from what we’ve heard from various elements of the Tea Party in the past six years.","2181","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-is-a-rapper"

And he lacks the minimal self-awareness required of the country’s chief executive. After making comments about dangerous Mexicans, he told NBC News, “I’ll tell you something, if I get the nomination, I’ll win the Latino vote.” Trump weirdly tends to preface references to ethnic categories with an article, e.g. his statement in 2011 that he has “a great relationship with the blacks.” This sounds like a quibble until you reflect upon the way placing an article before an ethnicity tends to be part of the setup for a statement that is cluelessly offensive.

Mike Huckabee vowed that he “will not acquiesce to any imperial court any more than our Founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch.” Bobby Jindal, for his part, joked (presumably), “Let’s just get rid of the Court.” Other candidates—Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio—offered milder reproaches to the rulings, but the prevailing sentiment on the right is one of retribution. “We can’t just sack up our bats and go home because the Supreme Court overreached,” Representative Steve King told reporters as he waited for Cruz to arrive at a campaign appearance in western Iowa. “We’re going to have to crack them in the knuckles instead.”","June 30, 2015","2184","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"On Monday, the Court ended the term with a few decisions that conservatives could cheer: one blocked President Obama’s effort to regulate emissions from coal-fired power plants; another permitted states to continue administering a drug in executions, despite questions about its effectiveness; and, looking ahead to the next term, the Court agreed to hear a challenge to the way public-sector unions collect their dues, and to reconsider a case on affirmative action in college admissions. Neither development bodes well for progressives. At the same time, a 5-4 majority, which included Justice Kennedy, gave conservatives further cause for knuckle-cracking: first, it upheld an independent redistricting commission created by Arizona voters, and, second, it allowed ten Texas abortion clinics to remain open while they appeal a Fifth Circuit ruling that would, in effect, force them to shut down. So the Republican candidates are taking nothing back. Cruz is pressing forward with his plan to provide “the means [of] throwing off judicial tyrants”: a constitutional amendment that would subject Supreme Court justices to a national “retention election” every eight years. Forget Ready for Hillary. We’re (Still) Ready for Ruth!","2185","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"The Iowa caucuses are more than half a year away. But emotions on the right—chiefly fear and fury—about the legalization of same-sex marriage and, to a lesser extent, the survival of Obamacare, will be raw for a long time. (Roe v. Wade, recall, was decided forty-two years ago.) Grassroots Republican rage means that there is little margin for the Party’s Presidential candidates in moving on, as Hillary Clinton urged (or baited) them to do last week. Most will roll out the old tropes about “out of control” judges—“liberal activists” who “legislate from the bench” and “trample the Constitution” (when they are not busy shredding it)—and promise to appoint the other kind of judges. This is standard campaign fare, like red, white, and blue bunting, or country music, and will excite, enrage, or bore you, depending on your predilections. Cruz’s idea that voters should be granted, as he puts it, “periodic power to pass judgment on the judgments of their judges,” is a more radical notion—one that finds favor among social conservatives. Cruz cites, as inspiration, a successful 2010 effort to remove three Iowa state Supreme Court judges who upheld same-sex marriage as constitutional, and similar campaigns to remove judges who defied conservative orthodoxy on the death penalty and on term limits for state legislators. “We’ve done it before, and we will do it again,” he said in Des Moines. Hedging his bets, Cruz—along with another Republican hopeful, Scott Walker—wants to strip the federal courts of their jurisdiction over the issue of marriage.","2186","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"Cruz is not just posturing; he is stoking a pervasive and potentially destructive strain of anti-court sentiment within the G.O.P. He is not just attacking particular opinions or judges; he is attacking the judiciary itself as inherently unrepresentative, unaccountable, and in need of restraint. The same mindset can be seen in Kansas Governor Sam Brownback’s threat to wipe out funding for the state judiciary if the state Supreme Court defies him and strikes down a law restricting its own authority. It is also apparent in the attempt, in 2013, by House and Senate Republicans to eliminate three vacant seats on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in order to deny President Obama the chance to fill them with his appointees, and in Newt Gingrich’s call, in 2011, to empower Congress to subpoena judges and haul them to the Hill to justify their decisions.","2187","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"This is not a string of scattered events; it is a strategy, and is not without precedent. In another irony that Cruz is unlikely to acknowledge, his crusade recalls that of a Republican progressive—Senator Robert M. La Follette, of Wisconsin—who, in 1922, charged that America was “ruled by a judicial oligarchy.” Speaking to the American Federation of Labor, in Cincinnati, La Follette condemned the Court—which had long been hostile to social reform and economic regulation—for overturning a federal ban on child labor, a workmen’s-compensation act, and other progressive legislation. “By a bare majority,” La Follette said, “the court has repeatedly overridden the will of the people as declared by their representatives in Congress and has construed the Constitution to mean whatever suited their peculiar economic and political views.”","2188","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"“The time has come,” La Follette shouted, as A.F.L. delegates stood on chairs and banged on tables, “when we must put the axe to the root of this monstrous growth upon the body of our government.” The axe: a constitutional amendment granting Congress a veto over Supreme Court decisions.","2189","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"La Follette’s proposal went nowhere, but his attack on the judiciary, his demand that it “be made responsive to the popular will,” had a lasting influence. It helped to condition a generation of progressives to see the problem with the Court, and with courts generally, as inherent—requiring fundamental, structural changes in the shape and function of the judiciary, not merely a batch of new and better judges. By the middle of the nineteen-thirties, when a conflict erupted between Franklin Roosevelt and the Supreme Court over the New Deal, liberals rushed to embrace radical solutions—amendments that would have rewritten key clauses of the Constitution and eroded or ended the system of checks and balances. Roosevelt’s plan to pack the Court emerged in that atmosphere. (The plan famously failed, but only just barely.) Cruz’s punitive proposals—and the campaign of judicial intimidation in Kansas and other states—can be seen, in this light, as a seeding of the ground that might well, someday, yield a bitter harvest.","2190","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-campaign-and-the-court"
"A remarkable thing almost happened to the two-party system in the summer of ’44: Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic President, about to be nominated for a fourth term, began a political flirtation with Wendell Willkie, the businessman Republican he’d defeated four years earlier, with the idea of forming a joint venture. No matter that, in 1940, Willkie had criticized the slowness of the economic recovery and, as Hitler’s Germany overran Europe, what he saw as American unreadiness. The two candidates had mostly agreed on big questions—above all, on sending military aid to Great Britain. Willkie’s sharpest criticism of F.D.R. focussed on his quest for a third term, a break with a two-term tradition that dated back to George Washington. “The doctrine of one man’s indispensability is a new doctrine for this country,” the Times editorial page noted, not approvingly, when the newspaper endorsed Willkie.","July 28, 2015","2191","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"As is still true today, party labels did not always mean what they seemed to mean. Willkie, a former Democrat, was never completely trusted by his party, though he had more in common with his 1944 primary competitors—Thomas E. Dewey, the New York governor; Harold Stassen, the former “boy governor” of Minnesota; even General Douglas MacArthur, the Pacific commander, whose vanity overcame his soldierly responsibilities—than many Republicans in this year’s free-for-all have with each other. Willkie quit the race in April, after Dewey won the Wisconsin primary, and Roosevelt was soon informed that Willkie was unhappy about being beaten by conservatives. More than that, F.D.R. told his special counsel, Samuel I. Rosenman, Willkie had been mulling “the possibility of a new setup in American politics.” Roosevelt, as Rosenman wrote in a memoir of his years at the White House, added that some Democrats “are out for my scalp, too”—referring to anti-New Deal sentiment in Texas and the South. “I think the time has come for the Democratic Party to get rid of its reactionary elements. … and to attract the liberals in the Republican Party. Willkie is the leader of those liberals.” It would have to be a long-term project, the President continued, “But we can do it in 1948, and we can start building it up right after the election this fall.” Roosevelt said that “Willkie and I together” could form this new party.","2192","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Roosevelt dispatched Rosenman to New York, where, secret-agent-style, he visited Willkie’s hotel suite and told him that Roosevelt “wants to team up with you.” Willkie was receptive and, on July 13th, even as F.D.R. was getting ready to ask Senator Harry Truman to be his running mate, he dictated a letter to Willkie saying, “I want to talk to you about the future, even the somewhat distant future, and in regard to the foreign relations problems of the immediate future.” This was a hard-to-keep secret. A headline reading “Willkie Asked by Roosevelt to Meet with Him” appeared in the August 11th edition of the New York Herald Tribune, followed by more stories, all suggesting that one topic would be the direction of the postwar world. Willkie’s initial reaction was “No comment,” while Roosevelt was at his most evasive, at first denying that the letter existed—which prompted an August 21st apology to Willkie—and then admitting that it was genuine. Willkie wrote, but never mailed, a letter to F.D.R. saying, “If it is agreeable with you, I would prefer postponement of any such talk until after the November election.” (Willkie was feeling pressure to support Dewey, his party’s nominee.)","2193","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"But this political serial ended abruptly when Willkie, on October 8th, died of a strep infection that spread to his heart. He was fifty-two. Six months later, Roosevelt, too, was dead, and so was his hybrid-party plot.","2194","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"It’s hard, though, to resist the thought that a new political force—a fusion party—might have been born that summer, that a Roosevelt-Willkie alliance, drawing on the moderate impulses of the major parties, might have planted roots and become a counterweight to an era like the present, when men and women professing all sorts of highly personal beliefs keep leaping into the Presidential race. Forget Donald Trump; just consider the “mainstream” Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, who announced his candidacy by saying, “We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed castle doctrine and concealed carry.” That sounded like a man running as a divider, not a uniter.","2195","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"A fusion party would accentuate coöperation, an urge present in 2004, when the Democrat John Kerry apparently asked the Republican John McCain to be his running mate. McCain said no, but the race would have been enthralling. President Eisenhower, in private, sometimes sounded off about breaking away from his party, and, when he contemplated dropping Richard Nixon from the ticket, in 1956, he considered asking the Ohio governor, Frank Lausche, a Catholic Democrat, to take his place. (Under very different circumstances, Abraham Lincoln, in 1864, took the border-state Democrat Andrew Johnson as a running mate.) Some possible alliances have gone unrealized—or unrecognized—because of party labels. On foreign policy, for instance, Hillary Clinton has often had more in common with the Republican Senator Lindsey Graham than with the Democrats Bernie Sanders or Jim Webb or, for that matter, Barack Obama.","2196","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"And, if it would have been too much to hope that, after the 2012 election, President Obama and a restless Mitt Romney could have discussed a centrist coalition, odd pairings can still happen. Obama and the Koch brothers, David and Charles, have managed to break through party barriers and ideology in the cause of criminal-justice reform.","2197","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"Certainly, if Willkie and Roosevelt had lived and followed through, their venture might have seemed far-fetched. But a short-lived alliance might have demonstrated that in a divided nation—even one with sixteen Republican Presidential contenders running wild—there might be a path to that calmer center, where, polls suggest, most people still want to live.","2198","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-willkie-what-if-f-d-r-s-hybrid-party-plot"
"On July 23rd, Donald Trump’s red-white-and-navy-blue Boeing 757 touched down in Laredo, Texas, where the temperature was climbing to a hundred and four degrees. In 1976, the Times introduced Trump, then a little-known builder, to readers as a “publicity shy” wunderkind who “looks ever so much like Robert Redford,” and quoted an admiring observation from the architect Der Scutt: “That Donald, he could sell sand to the Arabs.” Over the years, Trump honed a performer’s ear for the needs of his audience. He starred in “The Apprentice” for fourteen seasons, cultivating a lordly persona and a squint that combined Clint Eastwood on the high plains and Derek Zoolander on the runway. Once he emerged as the early front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, this summer, his airport comings and goings posed a delicate staging issue: a rogue wind off the tarmac could render his comb-over fully erect in front of the campaign paparazzi. So, in Laredo, Trump débuted a protective innovation: a baseball hat adorned with a campaign slogan that he recycled from Ronald Reagan’s 1980 run for the White House—“Make America Great Again!” The headwear, which had the rigid façade and the braided rope of a cruise-ship giveaway, added an expeditionary element to the day’s outfit, of blazer, pale slacks, golf shoes—well suited for a mission that he was describing as one of great personal risk. “I may never see you again, but we’re going to do it,” he told Fox News on the eve of the Texas visit.","2199","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"When Trump announced his candidacy, on June 16th, he vowed to build a two-thousand-mile-long wall to stop Mexico from “sending people that have lots of problems.” He said, “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Three of the statements had no basis in fact—the crime rate among first-generation immigrants is lower than that for native-born Americans—but Trump takes an expansive view of reality. “I play to people’s fantasies,” he writes in “The Art of the Deal,” his 1987 memoir. “I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective form of promotion.”","2200","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s campaign announcement was mocked and condemned—and utterly successful. His favorability among Republicans leaped from sixteen per cent to fifty-seven per cent, a greater spike than that of any other candidate’s début. Immigration became the centerpiece of his campaign. “Donald Trump has changed the entire debate on immigration,” Rush Limbaugh told his listeners last month. As the climax of events in Las Vegas and Phoenix, Trump brought onstage Jamiel Shaw, Sr., whose seventeen-year-old son was killed, in 2008, by a man who was in the country illegally. Trump stood by while Shaw told the crowd how his son was shot.","2201","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Before departing for Laredo, Trump said, “I’ve been invited by border patrols, and they want to honor me, actually, thousands and thousands of them, because I’m speaking up.” Though Trump said “border patrols,” the invitation had in fact come from a local branch of the border-patrol union, and the local, after consulting with headquarters, withdrew the invitation a few hours before Trump arrived, on the ground that it would not endorse political candidates. Descending the airplane stairs, Trump looked thrilled to be arriving amid a controversy; he waded into a crowd of reporters and described the change of plans as the handiwork of unspecified enemies. “They invited me, and then, all of a sudden, they were told, silencio! They want silence.” Asked why he felt unsafe in Laredo—which has a lower crime rate than New York City or Washington, D.C.—he invoked another “they”: “Well, they say it’s a great danger, but I have to do it. I love the country. There’s nothing more important than what I’m doing.”","2202","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Other Republicans offer “canned bullshit,” Rice went on. “People have got so terribly annoyed and disenchanted and disenfranchised, really, by candidates who get up there, and all their stump speeches promise everything to everyone.” By the night’s end, Rice was sold. “I heard echoes of Ronald Reagan,” he told me, adding, “If I had to vote today, I would vote for Trump.”","2223","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Dave Anderson, a New Hampshire Republican who retired from United Parcel Service, told me, “People say, ‘Well, it’d be nice to have another Bush.’ No, it wouldn’t be nice. We had two.

She worked at a furniture company, she said. “But the industry went down the tubes.” Her husband, Charlie, used to build household electricity meters at a General Electric plant, until the job moved to Mexico.

"Trump’s fans project onto him a vast range of imaginings—about toughness, business acumen, honesty—from a continuum that ranges from economic and libertarian conservatives to the far-right fringe.

The biggest surprise in Trump’s following? He “made an incredible surge among the Tea Party supporters,” according to Patrick Murray, who runs polling for Monmouth University. Before Trump announced his candidacy, only twenty per cent of Tea Partiers had a favorable view of him; a month later, that figure had risen to fifty-six per cent. Trump became the top choice among Tea Party voters, supplanting (and opening a large lead over) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, both Tea Party stalwarts. According to a Washington Post /ABC News poll conducted last month, the “broad majority” of Trump’s supporters hailed from two groups: voters with no college degree, and voters who say that immigrants weaken America.

On June 28th, twelve days after Trump’s announcement, the Daily Stormer, America’s most popular neo-Nazi news site, endorsed him for President: “Trump is willing to say what most Americans think: it’s time to deport these people.” The Daily Stormer urged white men to “vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests.”","2228","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Richard Spencer is a self-described “identitarian” who lives in Whitefish, Montana, and promotes “white racial consciousness.” At thirty-six, Spencer is trim and preppy, with degrees from the University of Virginia and the University of Chicago.

We’re moving into a new America.” He said, “I don’t think Trump is a white nationalist,” but he did believe that Trump reflected “an unconscious vision that white people have—that their grandchildren might be a hated minority in their own country.

"Jared Taylor, the editor of American Renaissance, a white-nationalist magazine and Web site based in Oakton, Virginia, told me, in regard to Trump, “I’m sure he would repudiate any association with people like me, but his support comes from people who are more like me than he might like to admit.”","2230","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"From the beginning of the current race, the conservative establishment has been desperate for Trump to be finished. After he disparaged the war record of Senator John McCain, the New York Post gave him a front-page farewell—“DON VOYAGE”—and a Wall Street Journal editorial declared him a “catastrophe.” But Trump carried on—in part because he had activated segments of the electorate that other candidates could not, or would not. On July 20th, three days before his trip to Texas, Ann Coulter, whose most recent book is “¡Adios, America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole,” appeared on Sean Hannity’s show and urged fellow-Republicans to see Trump’s summer as a harbinger. “The new litmus test for real conservatives is immigration,” she said. “They used to say the same thing about the pro-life Republicans and the pro-gun Republicans, and, ‘Oh, they’re fringe and they’re tacky, and we’re so embarrassed to be associated with them.’ Now every one of them comes along and pretends they’d be Reagan.”","2231","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"From the pantheon of great demagogues, Trump has plucked some best practices—William Jennings Bryan’s bombast, Huey Long’s wit, Father Charles Coughlin’s mastery of the airwaves—but historians are at pains to find the perfect analogue, because so much of Trump’s recipe is specific to the present. Celebrities had little place in American politics until the 1920 Presidential election, when Al Jolson and other stars from the fledgling film industry endorsed Warren Harding. Two decades ago, Americans were less focussed on paid-for politicians, so Ross Perot, a self-funded billionaire candidate, did not derive the same benefit as Trump from the perception of independence.","2232","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s signature lines—“The American dream is dead” and “We don’t have victories anymore”—constitute a bitter mantra in tune with a moment when the share of Americans who tell Gallup pollsters that there is “plenty of opportunity” has dropped to an unprecedented fifty-two per cent; when trust in government has reached its lowest level on record, and Americans’ approval of both major parties has sunk, for the first time, below forty per cent. Matthew Heimbach, who is twenty-four, and a prominent white-nationalist activist in Cincinnati, told me that Trump has energized disaffected young men like him. “He is bringing people back out of their slumber,” he said.","2233","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

But, on July 9th, VDARE, an opinion site founded to “push back the plans of pro-Amnesty/Immigration Surge politicians, ethnic activists and corrupt Big Business,” hailed Trump as “the first figure with the financial, cultural, and economic resources to openly defy elite consensus. If he can mobilize Republicans behind him and make a credible run for the Presidency, he can create a whole new media environment for patriots to openly speak their mind without fear of losing their jobs.” The piece was headlined “WE ARE ALL DONALD TRUMP NOW.”","2234","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s admirers hear in his words multiple appeals. Michael Hill heads the Alabama-based League of the South, a secessionist group that envisions an independent Southern republic with an “Anglo-Celtic” leadership. In 1981, Hill began teaching history at Stillman College, a historically black college in Tuscaloosa. He applied for jobs at other schools, and was turned down, which he attributes to affirmative action. In 1994, he co-founded the League, which put him at odds, he said, with “civil-rights-age, older black faculty and administrators, looking down their nose at this uppity white boy coming out here, talking about the Confederate flag and all that kind of stuff.” In 1999, he left Stillman. He told me, “If academia is not for me, because of who I am—a white Southern male, Christian, straight, whatever—then I’m going to find something that is. I’m going to fight this battle for my people.” Hill was moved by Trump’s frequent references to Kathryn Steinle, a thirty-two-year-old woman who, on July 1st, was walking with her father on a pier in San Francisco when she was fatally wounded in what police described as a random shooting. When police arrested Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a repeat felon who had been deported from the United States five times, Trump adopted the story of “that beautiful woman” as “another example of why we must secure our border immediately.” Hill told me, “That struck such a nerve with people, because a lot of this political stuff is abstract, but, as a father, I’ve got a daughter as well, and I could just see myself holding my daughter, and her looking up at me and saying, ‘Help me, Daddy.’ ” Hill, who condemns immigration and interracial marriage and warns of the influence of “Jewry,” said, “I love to see somebody like Donald Trump come along. Not that I believe anything that he says. But he is stirring up chaos in the G.O.P., and for us that is good.”","2235","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"I joined Hill at a League of the South meeting one afternoon in July, at its newly built headquarters, on a couple of verdant acres outside Montgomery, Alabama. It was the League’s annual conference, and there were about a hundred men and women; the older men were in courtly suits or jackets, and the younger set favored jeans, with handguns holstered in the waistband. The venders’ tables had books (“The True Selma Story,” “Authentic History of the Ku Klux Klan”), stickers (“The Federal Empire Is Killing the American Dream”), and raffle tickets. The prize: a .45-calibre Sig Sauer pistol.","2236","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"After years of decline, the League has recently acquired a number of younger members, including Brad Griffin, a thirty-four-year-old who writes an influential blog under the name Hunter Wallace. Short and genial, he wore Top-Siders, khaki shorts, and a polo shirt. As we talked, Griffin’s eyes wandered to his two-year-old son, who was roaming nearby. Griffin told me that he embraced white nationalism after reading Patrick Buchanan’s “Death of the West,” which argued, in Griffin’s words, that “all of the European peoples were dying out, their birthrates were low, and you had mass immigration and multiculturalism.” Griffin once had high hopes for the Tea Party. “They channelled all that rage into electing an impressive number of Republicans in the South, but then all they did was try to cut rich Republicans’ taxes and make life easier for billionaires!” he said. “It was all hijacked, and a classic example of how these right-wing movements emerge, and they’re misdirected into supporting the status quo.”","2237","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Griffin had recently told his readers that his opinion of Donald Trump was “soaring.” He sees Trump’s surge as a “hostile takeover of the Republican Party. He’s blowing up their stage-managed dog-and-pony show.” Griffin is repelled by big-money politics, so I asked why he spoke highly of Trump. “He’s a billionaire, but all of these other little candidates are owned by their own little billionaires.” He mentioned Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers. “So I think Trump is independent.”","2238","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"The longer I stayed, the more I sensed that my fellow-attendees occupied a parallel universe in which white Americans face imminent demise, the South is preparing to depart the United States, and Donald Trump is going to be President. When Hill took the stage, he told his compatriots that the recent lowering of the Confederate flag was just the beginning. Soon, he warned, adopting the unspecified “they,” they will come for the “monuments, battlefields, parks, cemeteries, street names, even the dead themselves.” The crowd was on its feet, cheering him on. “This, my friends, is cultural genocide,” he said, adding, “Often, as history has shown, cultural genocide is merely a prelude to physical genocide.” I ducked out to catch a flight to Des Moines: Trump was speaking the next day in Iowa.","2239","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

The buffet was serving free pulled-pork sandwiches, and Trump’s warmup act, Tana Goertz (runner-up, “The Apprentice,” Season 3), told the crowd, “Please go eat!

"It must be stated clearly that (to the delight of the far-right extremists I spoke with) a great many Republicans are mortified by Trump—horrified by his campaign of fear, embarrassed that others in the Party are not, and desperate to move on. But Trump’s strategy has its logic. Gary Johnson, who as a Republican served two terms as the governor of New Mexico, before becoming the 2012 Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, told me that anyone who runs for office discovers that some portion of the electorate is available to be enraged and manipulated, if a candidate is willing to do it. “I ran across this constantly,” he said. “This eight per cent out there that bangs their fist on the table and says, ‘The biggest problem we’re facing is immigration!’ And I’m going, ‘No! No! This is not the case!’ ” Johnson cited a poll that at that point put Trump’s support among Republicans at eighteen per cent, and told me, “I don’t think there’s an eighteen-per-cent element of this country that is just outright racist. But there is a segment out there that is, and he has definitely appealed to that.” Most people, in Johnson’s view, are animated by other parts of Trump’s pitch—“that he’s going to get in and make the tough deals, and nobody’s going to screw with him, because he’ll drop bombs.” That coalition—the fearful and the frustrated—is powerful. “That’s how you begin to get to eighteen per cent,” Johnson said.","2241","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As people turned up in Oskaloosa, I encountered some of the fearful. A construction worker named Ron James, wearing a T-shirt that said “Every-Juan Illegal Go Home,” told me that the “invasion of illegals” is eroding American culture: “We’re getting flushed down the toilet.” But the vast majority of the room, as best I could tell, was more like Stephanie DeVolder, an elegant fiftysomething, with blond hair and bright-green eyes, who had worked as a sales rep for Dice, a job-search site. She was glad that Trump had “brought up the horrific treatment of the veterans,” and that “he is a foremost believer in the military,” and she admired his work on television. “I bought the videos of ‘The Apprentice,’ and watched the whole thing,” she said. “He is a phenomenal judge of character, and he actually does have a heart. He is absolutely amazing.” His fame had guided her to his political views, and, in time, she had concluded that he was “absolutely right about border security.”","2242","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Emerging from the wings, in a navy suit, a white shirt, and a pink tie, Trump paused midway across the stage to spread his arms in a gesture of astonished, grateful embrace. For years, Trump has been compared to P. T. Barnum, but the comparison doesn’t capture his range; on the campaign trail, he is less the carnival barker than the full cast—the lion, the fire-eater, the clown with the seltzer—all trussed into a single-breasted Brioni suit. Music from the “Karate Kid” soundtrack blared—“You’re the best around! Nothing’s gonna ever keep you down!”—and, for a moment, Trump looked genuinely startled by the ardor of the stargazers in the crowd. At the lectern, he said, “It’s a terrific place, Iowa.” Then he monologued for an hour, off the cuff, on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server (“What she did is very criminal”); Scott Walker (“Finally, I can attack!”); the Veterans Administration (“the most corrupt group of people in all of Washington”).","2243","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"As always, he created a powerful set piece about Mexican criminals who are allowed to “roam around, shooting people and killing people,” as he put it. He described this as a hidden scourge: “Such a big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it.” He reminded the crowd of his trip to Laredo: “I told the pilots, I said, ‘Fly a little bit away from the border, please. Fly a little bit inland.’ It’s a whole scary thing.” He said that when he returned to New York his wife had greeted him in tears. “You made it safely from the border!” she cried. As always, he spoke of Kathryn Steinle’s murder—“Kate, beautiful Kate”—and of the death of Jamiel Shaw’s son, “shot by an animal, an animal that shouldn’t have been in this country.” He urged Iowans to be afraid, even if they didn’t see the threat. “When you’re afraid to walk into your own country, it’s pretty bad,” he said. “Hard to believe. You don’t have that problem in Iowa, in all fairness. But it’s pretty rough out there.”","2244","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Over the years, Trump has rejected the suggestion that he is a “belligerent, loudmouthed racist,” as Paul Krugman, the Times columnist, put it recently. “I have a great relationship with the blacks,” Trump said on the radio, in 2011.","2245","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump has always weaved in and out of racially charged controversies. In 2000, he secretly ran ads opposing a Catskills casino backed by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, because it would rival his businesses in Atlantic City. Beneath a picture of drug paraphernalia, the ad asked, “Are these the new neighbors we want?” Tribal leaders denounced the message as “racist and inflammatory,” and Trump and his associates were fined by New York State for concealing the true source of the ads. In March, 2011, Trump, who was considering a Presidential run, resurrected the crackpot theory that Barack Obama is not an American citizen, declaring, “I want him to show his birth certificate.” (It had already been publicly available for more than three years.) Trump’s declaration gave the issue new prominence. At the time, Trump’s on-again, off-again political adviser, the former Nixon aide Roger Stone, said that the decision to become a birther was “a brilliant base-building move.”","2246","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s phantasmagorical visions of marauding immigrants are part of a genre in which immigration and race are intermingled. In recent years, hoaxes and theories that were once confined to the margins have been laundered through mainstream media outlets. In 2013, Fox News repeatedly broadcast warnings about the “knockout game,” based on a self-published book by the white nationalist Colin Flaherty, which described black men randomly attacking white pedestrians. In a study published in the journal Race & Class, Mike King, a sociologist at SUNY-Oneonta, searched for a single actual case of the knockout game and found none. The news reports were largely patched together from unrelated viral videos of street violence. Bureau of Justice statistics show, King wrote, a “marked decrease in random assaults, including black assaults on white strangers.”","2247","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

"Taylor, who calls himself a “racial dissident,” was slim and decorous in gray trousers and a button-down when we met. For years, he and others have sensed an opportunity on the horizon to expand their ranks. When Obama was elected in 2008, Stormfront, the leading white-supremacist Web forum, crashed from heavy traffic. The Klan, weakened by lawsuits and infighting, barely exists anymore, but the Internet draws in young racists like Dylann Roof, who is accused of the June 17th massacre of nine people at a church in Charleston. The attack inspired a broad effort to remove the Confederate flag—from the state capitol and from the shelves of Amazon and of Walmart and a host of other retail stores. Defenders of the flag were galvanized, and they organized more than a hundred rallies around the South, interpreting the moment, months after racial unrest in Ferguson and Baltimore, as a sign of a backlash against political correctness and multiculturalism. Trump’s language landed just as American hate groups were more energized than at any time in years. Griffin, the blogger for the League of the South, told me that the removal of the flag had crystallized “fears that people have about what happens when we become a minority. What happens when we have no control over things? You’re seeing it play out right now.”","2249","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

In a study published in 2011, Michael Norton, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Samuel Sommers, a professor of psychology at Tufts, found that more than half of white Americans believe that whites have replaced blacks as “the primary victims of discrimination” today, even though, as Norton and Sommers write, “by nearly any metric—from employment to police treatment, loan rates to education—statistics continue to indicate drastically poorer outcomes for Black than White Americans.”","2251","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

I watched it on television with Matthew Heimbach, the young white nationalist in Cincinnati, and some of his friends. Heimbach, whom anti-racist activists call “the Little Fuhrer,” for his tirades against “rampant multiculturalism,” founded the Traditionalist Youth Network, a far-right group that caters to high-school and college students and pushes for the separation of blacks and whites. Stocky and bearded, Heimbach is ambitious.

When I asked Heimbach how he got involved with Fascist politics, he laughed. “I was not raised like this,” he said. “I was raised to be a normal small-town Republican.” The son of teachers in Poolesville, Maryland, an hour from Washington, he, like Brad Griffin, credited Buchanan’s book “Death of the West” for seeding his conception of a desolate future. “Even if you play the game, even if you do everything right, then the future, when it comes to your income, when it comes to benefits, when it comes to everything, we are going to be the first generation in American history to be living worse than our parents.” He went on, “My own parents tell me, ‘Well, you should just shut up, you should go get a normal job, and get a two-car garage, and then you’ll be happy.’ ”","2255","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"

Between 1979 and 2013, pay for men without a college degree fell by twenty-one per cent in real terms; for women with similar credentials, pay rose by three per cent, thanks partly to job opportunities in health care and education. Like many ultraconservatives, Heimbach had largely given up on the Republican Party.

Other Republicans recoiled, convinced that Trump’s nativist turn would taint the Party’s image as ruinously as Mitt Romney’s “self-deportation” comments in his race against Barack Obama. At the time, Trump himself disapproved of Romney’s approach, saying, in November, 2012, “He had a crazy policy of ‘self- deportation,’ which was maniacal.

In doing so, he pulled America into a current that is coursing through other Western democracies—Britain, France, Spain, Greece, Scandinavia—where xenophobic, nationalist parties have emerged since the 2008 economic crisis to besiege middle-ground politicians. In country after country, voters beset by inequality and scarcity have reached past the sober promises of the center-left and the center-right to the spectre of a transcendent solution, no matter how cruel. “The more complicated the problem, the simpler the demands become,” Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at the University of California in San Diego, told me. “When people get frustrated and irritated, they want to cut the Gordian knot.”","2268","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump has succeeded in unleashing an old gene in American politics—the crude tribalism that Richard Hofstadter named “the paranoid style”—and, over the summer, it replicated like a runaway mutation. Whenever Americans have confronted the reshuffling of status and influence—the Great Migration, the end of Jim Crow, the end of a white majority—we succumb to the anti-democratic politics of absolutism, of a “conflict between absolute good and absolute evil,” in which, Hofstadter wrote, “the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Nothing but complete victory will do.” Trump was born to the part. “I’ll do nearly anything within legal bounds to win,” he wrote, in “The Art of the Deal.” “Sometimes, part of making a deal is denigrating your competition.” Trump, who long ago mastered the behavioral nudges that could herd the public into his casinos and onto his golf courses, looked so playful when he gave out Lindsey Graham’s cell-phone number that it was easy to miss just how malicious a gesture it truly was. It expressed the knowledge that, with a single utterance, he could subject an enemy to that most savage weapon of all: us.","2269","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Trump’s candidacy has already left a durable mark, expanding the discourse of hate such that, in the midst of his feuds and provocations, we barely even registered that Senator Ted Cruz had called the sitting President “the world’s leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism,” or that Senator Marco Rubio had redoubled his opposition to abortion in cases of rape, incest, or a mortal threat to the mother. Trump has bequeathed a concoction of celebrity, wealth, and alienation that is more potent than any we’ve seen before. If, as the Republican establishment hopes, the stargazers eventually defect, Trump will be left with the hardest core—the portion of the electorate that is drifting deeper into unreality, with no reconciliation in sight. ♦","2270","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"
"Something about being the mayor of New York seems to inspire a longing to leave Gracie Mansion and explore the big world across the Hudson. Perhaps the job leaves one feeling ready to tackle something bigger—although what could be bigger than trying to bring sense and order to New York? It might make the White House look easy. The lure of extra-urban adventure briefly drew Rudolph Giuliani into a Senate race, in 2000, and, in his post-mayoralty, into the 2008 Presidential race. That venture helped to drive a stake through a reputation that had soared after the September 11th attacks. If only Rudy had rested. But he went national, and since failing in the 2008 primaries he has retreated to a semiprivate life, occasionally popping up with utterances that make him sound borderline deranged—for instance: “I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America…. He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country.”","May 26, 2015","2271","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-are-new-yorks-mayors-so-restless"
"Other mayors have entertained national dreams. Robert F. Wagner, Jr., one of the city’s four three-term mayors (the others were Fiorello La Guardia, Edward Koch, and Michael Bloomberg), was a long-shot Vice-Presidential candidate in 1956. In the summer of 1968, before he switched parties and became a Democrat, John V. Lindsay, that glamorous and, by the end of his term, ineffective mayor, was widely promoted as a possible running mate for Richard Nixon; the columnist Joseph Kraft imagined a Nixon-Lindsay “dream ticket.” (Nixon picked Spiro Agnew, the governor of Maryland, who ended up resigning in disgrace.) While Mario Cuomo once wanted to be mayor (he lost in a bitter primary to Ed Koch, in 1977), Koch wanted to be governor (he lost to Cuomo in a bitter 1982 primary). Cuomo, in 1992, seemed close to running for President until, after a long battle with the forces of indecision, he backed out just before the filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary. As for the Presidency, as Sam Roberts noted in the Times, the only former mayors of any American cities ever to win the White House were Grover Cleveland (of Buffalo) and Calvin Coolidge (of Northampton, Massachusetts). Coolidge, though, had a head start by already being President, inheriting the job after Warren G. Harding died in office.","2272","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-are-new-yorks-mayors-so-restless"
"If New York mayors sometimes suffer from what might be called Mayoral Restlessness Syndrome, the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, has an early-onset case, having held his job for a mere seventeen months. He’s already journeyed west, taking with him his new “progressive contract with America,” inspired, if that is the word, by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s not-so-progressive 1994 Contract with America. De Blasio seems untroubled that his approval rating in the city has never been lower—around forty-four per cent, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll—or that he has yet to establish a reputation large enough to tarnish.","2273","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-are-new-yorks-mayors-so-restless"
"De Blasio recently headed to Iowa, as well as to Wisconsin, Nebraska, and even California. New York mayors sometimes seem lost when they leave the confines of the city. Ed Koch, when he ran for governor, said that living in rural America was “a joke…. You have to drive twenty miles to buy a gingham dress or Sears, Roebuck suit.” Bill de Blasio, in the Midwest, was followed by unfriendly questions about his campaign pledge to ban horse-drawn carriages in Central Park. A rancher and radio host asked the Mayor how he could stand up for working people while trying to eliminate the livelihood of some three hundred unionized carriage drivers, adding that tourists who come to the city “want the quintessential visit, which is a Central Park ride in a carriage.” On this subject, the Mayor usually speaks as if he were the champion of the city’s well-treated horses, though the Times also asked, “What will happen to the stables, on coveted property on the West Side of Manhattan?” and continued, “Not for nothing do people wonder why the force behind … the group pushing the anticarriage crusade is a real estate developer.” That’s a sensitive issue, but de Blasio has quickly learned about local sensitivities—for instance, the way that his embrace of the Reverend Al Sharpton, and his praise for him as “a blessing for this city … a blessing for this nation,” played with the average city cop.","2274","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-are-new-yorks-mayors-so-restless"
"De Blasio’s trek may have something to do with next year’s Presidential election and the Iowa caucuses. De Blasio used to work for the Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, although he has so far “withheld” his endorsement—a withholding that is not likely to mean much in Iowa or anywhere else, or to push her toward any position that she doesn’t already hold, unless it’s a stand on carriage horses. When New York mayors insert themselves into Presidential campaigns, it can end badly. (In 1988, Ed Koch’s rambling endorsement of Senator Al Gore helped undermine Gore’s showing in the New York primary which, in turn, pretty much finished off his candidacy.) In Iowa, de Blasio said that Washington needs to deal with “rampant inequality” and that the “hyper-concentration of wealth is un-American,” despite it being a phenomenon with a long American history. Theodore Roosevelt railed, more than a century ago, at “the malefactors of great wealth.” T.R., when he was a New York assemblyman, had his own dreams: he wanted to be mayor of New York. But he lost the election, in 1886. He had to settle for city police commissioner and then, a few years later, bigger things.","2275","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-are-new-yorks-mayors-so-restless"
"As you may have heard, two more candidates have entered the G.O.P. primary contest: Ben Carson, the famous neurosurgeon from Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, who turned to conservative politics a few years ago, and Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.

Then there are Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, who are both busy raising money and making what amount to campaign speeches, but who have yet to make their candidacies official. Beyond these eight lie a host of maybes, wannabes, and long shots. They include the former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum and the former Texas governor Rick Perry, both of whom lost to Mitt Romney in 2012; John Kasich, the governor of Ohio; Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana; Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina; Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey; and Donald Trump, the governor of Trump Tower and a bunch of upscale golf resorts.","2277","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"

"If your head is spinning, join the club. Nobody should be expected, or forced, to keep up with every detail of the G.O.P. primary, especially when, Lord help us, we still have more than eight months to go until the Iowa caucuses. At this stage, the important thing to remember is that there are really two spectacles taking place: a high-stakes horse race for the Republican nomination, and a circus held on the infield of the track. Although the events run concurrently, and are ostensibly geared toward the same end, they shouldn’t be confused with one another. One is a serious political contest. The other is a sideshow, designed to amuse the spectators, give the media something to cover, and further the ambitions, varied as they are, of the participants.","2279","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Ostensibly, the G.O.P. field looks confusing and wide open. In many polls, nobody gets the support of even twenty per cent of potential Republican voters. But if you allow for some variability from survey to survey, a distinctive pattern has emerged. The Real Clear Politics poll of polls, which combines data from many individual polls, shows that Bush has been in the lead for most of the past six months, and that he’s still ahead, with a polling average of 15.5 per cent. Rubio has been gaining ground since he announced his candidacy three weeks ago, and is now in second place, at 14.3 per cent. Walker, who enjoyed a surge earlier this year, is now in third place, with 12.8 per cent.","2280","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the horse race is settling down, with Bush as the front runner, Walker and Rubio tucked in behind, and Paul and Cruz further back. A new survey, by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, confirms this picture—indeed, it suggests that the front runners may be pulling a bit further ahead. The poll showed Bush at twenty-three per cent, Rubio at eighteen per cent, and Walker at fourteen per cent. Paul and Cruz were both at eleven per cent.*","2281","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Huckabee could yet emerge as a sixth serious contender. A fixture on conservative television and radio, the Arkansan will pick up votes from evangelical Christians, although it’s hard to see him expanding much beyond that demographic. The rest in the field look as though they are destined for the circus. Of course, one of them could still burst through the rails and join the front-runners, as Herman Cain did for a time in 2011. But the polls, the money, and the political topography are against them.","2282","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"The ultra-conservative end of the field is already crowded, with Walker, Paul, and Cruz competing against each other, and Huckabee and Carson about to join them. Carson, an African-American who grew up in a poor family in Detroit, has a compelling personal story to tell, and his message of small government and self-reliance goes over well with many Republicans. But the long buildup to his campaign launch has been marked by a series of inflammatory statements, including one, while he was discussing same-sex marriage, in 2013, in which he equated gays with members of NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association. (He later apologized.) And in March of this year, he said that being gay is a choice, and added, “A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they’re gay.’ ” It’s not clear whether Carson has been deliberately outrageous in order to attract the attention of right-wing talk-show hosts, or whether he is just gaffe-prone. In either case, he is looking increasingly like a fringe candidate.","2283","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"The moderate-conservative end of the G.O.P. field has a bit more space open than the conservative end. With Chris Christie’s candidacy snarled up in the Fort Lee traffic, Bush and Rubio are the two leading contenders in this part of the spectrum—although, as I’ve noted before, it’s far from clear that either of them deserves to be called a moderate. Potentially, there is room for an avowedly non-ideological candidate who can reach across party lines, and Fiorina may be aiming to occupy it. Since entering politics, she has adopted conservative positions on issues such as climate change, same-sex marriage, and eliminating the estate tax. In the campaign video announcing her candidacy on Monday, however, she didn’t focus on any of these things. Instead, she attacked Hillary Clinton, but also, by extension, many of her Republican rivals, saying, “Our founders never intended us to have a professional political class…. If you’re tired of the sound bites, the vitriol, the pettiness, the egos, the corruption… then join us.”","2284","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"As the only woman likely to enter the G.O.P. field, and a possible foil for Clinton, Fiorina is guaranteed to receive some media attention. Her challenge is that many people don’t think she has much of a record to run on. If this were 1998, when she was a senior executive at Lucent Technologies, and Fortune magazine named her as the most powerful women in business, she would be in better shape. However, her tenure as Hewlett-Packard’s C.E.O., from 1999 to 2005, was widely criticized, and ended with the board of directors forcing her out (albeit with the consolation of a twenty-million-dollar golden parachute). In 2010, she ran for the U.S. Senate in California, and Barbara Boxer beat her handily. During the campaign, the Los Angeles Times reported that Fiorina hadn’t voted in numerous elections. She apologized, saying, “Shame on me.”","2285","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"
"Currently, Fiorina is running dead last in the G.O.P. polls, but she was visited New Hampshire on Monday, attending a luncheon with local lawmakers and pressing the flesh. In the early stages of Presidential races, hope springs eternal. And even if things don’t work out for her campaign, it will probably help her sell some books. As it happens, she’s got a new one that is being released on Tuesday: “Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey.”","2286","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-g-o-p-horse-race-and-the-g-o-p-circus"

"The filmmaker David Thorpe has a warm, woolly speaking voice with a bit of a lilt. It’s a little floaty on the cadences, a little strong on the “S”s. You know what I’m getting at? He sounds gay. Not that there’s anything wrong with that.","July 10, 2015","2288","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/is-there-a-gay-voice"
"Or is there? Not long after Thorpe broke up with his boyfriend, he began thinking about the way he speaks, and the way other gay men speak, and why both suddenly bothered him so much. When he listened to himself, he felt “out of synch” with his own voice. On a train to Fire Island, he was repelled by the chattering men around him, who sounded like “a bunch of braying ninnies.”","2289","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/is-there-a-gay-voice"
"This is how he describes the moment in his documentary “Do I Sound Gay?,” which opens this weekend at the IFC Center. The subject sounds slight, but Thorpe digs surprisingly deep, asking questions about stereotypes and self-loathing that are seldom asked. (Try saying that last sentence out loud with a lisp.) Putting himself on camera, Thorpe visits a speech therapist who points out his “upspeak,” his “nasality,” and his “singsong pattern.” He talks to a linguistics professor, a film historian, and a Hollywood voice coach who trains actors to sound straighter. He interviews gay public figures, including David Sedaris, Tim Gunn, Don Lemon, and George Takei, who have had to listen to themselves for a living. He even asks people on the street if they think he sounds gay. “I woulda just maybe lumped you in with the artsy-fartsy,” one woman tells him.","2290","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/is-there-a-gay-voice"
"The subject turns out to be a minefield, because what’s more connected to personality than the way we speak? Gay adolescents, Thorpe points out, often learn that the “tell” of their sexuality is their voices, even more so than physicality—a limp wrist is easier to straighten out than an inflection. The world’s homophobia becomes internalized homophobia. Even within the gay dating community (and in gay porn), hyper-masculinity is habitually prized, so self-disgust gets easily turned back outward. The pop-culture roots run deep, from the aristocratic pansies of the pre-Hays Code cinema through wink-wink camp figures like Paul Lynde and Liberace, up through the effete Disney villains of “Aladdin” and “The Lion King.”","2291","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/is-there-a-gay-voice"
"Of course, not all gay men have the same voice, or any “gay” voice: it is a stereotype, after all. Thorpe talks to a straight friend who sounds “gay” (he grew up on an ashram, surrounded by women), and a gay friend who sounds “straight” (he has jock brothers). But Thorpe admits that there’s something unnerving about having learned, subconsciously, to adopt a stereotype. Did he choose to sound gay or did sounding gay choose him? A friend from childhood tells him that, when he came out in college, his inflections suddenly changed, and part of her still hears the voice of an “imposter” when he talks. It reminded me of a straight friend who once told me, soon after I came out, that I was starting to sound “essy.” (The gay “lisp” is a bit of a misnomer, usually referring to a sibilant “S.”) Was I finding my true voice, or just reprogramming myself to conform to a different group?","2292","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/is-there-a-gay-voice"
"Obviously, the conclusion—the film’s, and mine—is to dissociate the “gay voice” from shame and reattach it to pride, but it isn’t so easy. “For many gay men, that’s the last vestige, that’s the last chunk of internalized homophobia, is this hatred of how they sound,” Dan Savage tells Thorpe. The obstacles, once you think about them, are seismic, given the countless ways our culture awards status to masculine attributes over feminine ones. One of the ways gay people tend to compensate, the film suggests, is to adopt the supercilious speech patterns of the leisure class, i.e. sounding “artsy-fartsy.” You might also call it wit or intelligence, a benefit of cultural remove. Either way, you can end up sounding like Addison DeWitt.","2293","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/is-there-a-gay-voice"
"Any marginalized group faces its own version of this dilemma, whether it’s immigrants straining to erase their accents, the debate over Ebonics, or women of the “Lean In” age redefining what it means to be assertive without imitating men. The CNN anchor Don Lemon tells Thorpe that he worked harder to neutralize his Southern black accent than his “gay” accent. (The phenomenon of gay white men imitating black women’s speech is its own thorny subcategory.) Hillary Clinton’s speech patterns—that here-and-gone Arkansas twang, those “authoritative” masculine cadences—are sure to keep linguists busy for decades. As gays and lesbians gain cultural capital, helped along by equality victories like the one just handed down by the Supreme Court, “gay voice” will surely evolve, too. For more and more people, there will be less need to hide it, at school, at work, or on television. On the other hand, it could assimilate into oblivion.","2294","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/is-there-a-gay-voice"

"The two times I have called Philip Glass at home, I have interrupted his composing. In 2012, during the same week that the début recording of his Symphony No. 9 was on the front page of the iTunes store, Glass told me that he had recently finished Symphony No. 10, and that he was already moving onto a new opera project. (He was also about to turn seventy-five.) This week, when a documentary crew took to Kickstarter to find funds to finish a movie about Glass’s first opera with the director Robert Wilson—the four-hour-plus, non-narrative stage extravaganza “Einstein on the Beach”—I found Glass at work once again, just before 9 A.M. “I’m doing something now, and I’d like to continue doing it,” he said, congenially. We agreed that I’d call again in a few hours.","June 4, 2015","2296","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"Philip Glass never stops writing, it seems, though public opportunities to absorb his work aren’t always as steady. With “Einstein on the Beach,” specifically, Glass distinguishes between recordings of his score and the experience of the live opera, full productions of which are hard to come by. Speaking of the opera’s popular legacy, Glass told me that “the whole visual element of the piece [was] simply neglected for practical reasons. We could record it, no problem, but we couldn’t film it.” And yet the opera is co-credited to both Glass and Wilson for good reason: the director’s stage designs predated and influenced Glass’s music. “You could look at images of it,” Glass said when I called him back at our appointed time, before adding that something would inevitably be missing for those who hadn’t caught the original production, in 1976, or else its revivals in 1984, 1992, and 2012.","2297","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"Enter the documentarian John Walter, who followed the 2012 world-tour revival of “Einstein on the Beach.” Glass told me that both he and Wilson had long doubted the ability of a video crew to capture the manic, all-over-the-stage density of Wilson’s “Einstein” staging. But an eight-camera shoot of a performance in Paris “bowled me over,” Glass said. “It was far better than what we thought was possible.” In the years since, Walter has been working on “The Earth Moves,” his documentary about the opera and what is likely to be its last revival under the supervision of the original creative team.","2298","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"“He invited me down to see different parts of it, and I have to say, he is an extraordinarily good filmmaker,” Glass said. A look at the trailer for the film, hosted on the Kickstarter page, shows that Walter has indeed done his homework. While he’s had access to Glass, Wilson, and their collaborators, “The Earth Moves” also surveys the impressions of other key artists from the New York of that moment, such as John Lurie and Laurie Anderson. Though one prior documentary about “Einstein” exists—1985’s one-hour “Einstein on the Beach: The Changing Image of Opera”—Walter’s project has the benefit of a longer and deeper artistic legacy on which to report.","2299","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"“In context of the expenses, it’s probably not very much,” Glass said of the hundred-thousand-dollar fundraising goal that Walter set on Kickstarter. “But in terms of the real world, it’s not pocket money. It’s serious money; it had to be found.” To that end, he’s offering up the first page of the “Einstein” score, written in his own hand, for the price of $10,000. “We have to do it,” Glass said. “We’re short!”","2300","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"With Glass still on the phone, I took the opportunity to ask what he had been writing when I called him earlier. “I’m working on one of the last scenes of ‘Appomattox,’ which is an opera that’s being done at the Kennedy Center in November. I’m at the end of the writing process; we’re five months before opening night.”","2301","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"This was a surprising answer, given that Glass’s opera about Lee’s surrender to Grant premièred at the San Francisco Opera in 2007. “What’s happened since then is that the Supreme Court did its best to get rid of the affirmative right to vote,” Glass explained, in a reference to the Court’s recent decision in Shelby County v. Holder. “And then when the Washington Opera said they would like to do ‘Appomattox’ as part of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War … I said, ‘Well now I have to rewrite the second act,’ because I can’t end it where I ended it. … Now in the opera we have L.B.J. and Martin Luther King and George Wallace and J. Edgar Hoover. They’re there now in Act II—they were not at all in the other version. Which actually was quite O.K. until we discovered that the Civil War isn’t over yet.”","2302","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"During a longer conversation about politics that followed, we talked about Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders (the composer likes the Vermont senator’s focus on inequality) and the possibility of “quasi-anarchy” in America’s future. “But, at any rate, now we’re getting back to ‘Einstein,’ which is supposed to be what we’re talking about,” Glass eventually said, steering us back on course. “When I look back on it, I see that there is a borderline chaos in ‘Einstein,’ which we like about it. Which many of us in America like. It gets you up in the morning. It gets you going! Maybe that’s too irreverent, but I think you get the gist.” And since he has only five months left to revise an opera before it hits the Kennedy Center stage, it’s here that I realize that I’ve taken enough of the composer’s time, and that he needs to get back to work.","2303","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/philip-glass-never-stops-writing"
"At about 8 P.M. last night, a young man walked into the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston and took a seat. Others in the church were taking part in a weekly Bible study and prayer circle. He “stayed there for almost an hour before the event,” as Police Chief Greg Mullen said at a press conference at seven this morning. The event was the man taking a gun—the police haven’t said what kind yet—and shooting nine people in the church dead. He is in custody; at the press conference, the police chief showed grainy pictures, stills from security footage, and an image of his car, a black Hyundai, and asked for help in identifying him. Three hours later, there was a name: Dylann Roof, twenty-one years old, of Lexington, South Carolina. An hour after that, by 11:30 A.M., Roof had been caught. He had driven to North Carolina, and was two hundred and fifty miles from Charleston.","June 18, 2015","2304","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/dylann-roof-and-a-night-of-hate-in-charleston"
"Roof is a slim white man, about five-nine; in the security photos, he was wearing jeans, a gray pullover, and Timberland boots. The victims were all black; the congregation has historically been black, too. “There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is a hate crime,” Mullen said, in answer to a question. He had used similar words when he spoke in the middle of the night, and explained that the hate-crime designation facilitated the involvement of other law-enforcement and federal agencies. (Later, Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the Justice Department was investigating the incident as a hate crime.) Mayor Joe Riley, who was standing next to him, said that it was an “unfathomable and unspeakable act by somebody filled with hate, and with a deranged mind.”","2305","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/dylann-roof-and-a-night-of-hate-in-charleston"
"That the shooter was filled with hate, at least, seems almost certain—how do you sit at prayer with people for an hour and then kill them? But, while hatred and madness can go together, the “deranged” judgment should wait until we know more about whom we are dealing with. Roof’s mental-health history is not clear. There may be other labels that turn out to be appropriate, like domestic terrorist. Immediately after Roof’s name was released, pictures from his Facebook page circulated; in one, he appeared to be wearing patches of the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia. That is more than suggestive. There is also a mug shot in circulation: Roof was, according to press reports, arrested on March 1st, on a drug charge, and on April 26th, for trespassing. He was out on bond. Sometime in April, he had his twenty-first birthday; one of his presents, from a relative, was, according to a Reuters report, a gun.","2306","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/dylann-roof-and-a-night-of-hate-in-charleston"
"President Barack Obama, speaking just after noon, spoke of his “deep sorrow,” and the “heartbreak, and the sadness, and the anger.” He said that he knew one of the victims, Clementa Pinckney, the church’s pastor. Pinckney was also a state senator—in other words, this might also be seen as a political murder. He had become a preacher when he was eighteen—three years younger than Roof. There is a report on NBC, based on what a relative of Pinckney’s says a survivor told her, that the shooter asked to sit next to Pinckney, and that, when the shooting started, Pinckney tried to talk him out of it, as the shooter reloaded five times and talked about black people taking over the country, and raping women, and how they had to “go.” Pinckney was forty-one, and, according to the Charleston Post and Courier, married, with two children. There were two other men and six women among the victims, and statements from family and witnesses suggested that at least some of them were older people. The Post and Courier quoted John Quil Lance, who was waiting for news of his grandmother, Ethel Lance. “I’m lost,” he said. “She’s a Christian, hardworking; I could call my granny for anything. I don’t have anyone else like that.”","2307","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/dylann-roof-and-a-night-of-hate-in-charleston"

"There was a certain caution in the comments of the police chief and mayor at this morning’s press conference: for the moment, they circled around the question of what sort of hate we might be witnessing. “We don’t know if anyone was targeted, other than the church itself,” Mullen said at the press conference, before Roof’s identity was known. The mayor, too, focussed on the crime scene as a place of worship. “Of all communities for Charleston, to have a horrible, hateful person go into a church and kill people there to pray and worship with each other is something that is beyond incomprehensible, and is not explained,” Riley said. He mentioned that this was a “historic church,” and that the black church had a historic role, a reminder that a congregation can also be a community. He said that Charleston “honors our religious institutions and respects the different cultures and beliefs—we call it the Holy City, with all the spires that reach up to the sky.” And yet this was a church whose first home was burned to the ground by the city’s white citizens, in the eighteen-twenties, in retribution for a planned slave rebellion. Almost three dozen black Charlestonians were also executed, including Denmark Vesey, one of the church’s founders. In 1799, Vesey, whose master hired him out as a carpenter, had bought a lottery ticket, and won. He bought his own freedom, but his wife’s master wouldn’t let him buy hers; every time she and Vesey had a child, the master, under the law, gained a slave. Charleston is also next to North Charleston, where Walter Scott was killed by a policeman for no good reason earlier this year.","2309","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/dylann-roof-and-a-night-of-hate-in-charleston"
"Obama, in his statement, spoke of the burning of the church as part of the fight to end slavery; he noted that the present building had been a way station for speakers and marchers during the civil-rights movement; when he called it “sacred ground,” it was clear that he meant the term in more than one sense. But Obama also spoke passionately about the American pathology of gun violence—“at some point, it’s going to be important for the American people to get a grip on this”—and acknowledged that, in terms of passing gun-control laws, the politics were against him. Indeed, he sounded more optimistic about where America was headed on race than where it is mired on guns.","2310","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/dylann-roof-and-a-night-of-hate-in-charleston"
"The mayor and the police chief were likely just being careful. They couldn’t, again, know exactly what the murderer of these nine people was thinking—although, between the reports about Roof (who is still only a suspect) and of what the survivors heard, we are getting the picture. As Margaret Talbot wrote in the magazine this week, in a piece on the shooting of three Muslim-American students in North Carolina, hate can serve as an accelerant of violence. So can a gun, in the hands of a man like the suspect, who doesn’t, in the pictures, look particularly big—or in anyone’s hands. And there can be many kinds of hate afoot in this country.","2311","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/dylann-roof-and-a-night-of-hate-in-charleston"
"But it is precisely at moments like this that it can be helpful to speak certain words clearly—words like racism. Riley, who has been mayor since 1975 and has brought much of the city together, is well-positioned to do that. He has, in the past, taken important steps, such as leading a march to the State Capitol asking that legislators stop flying the Confederate flag. (It’s still there.) The need for clear speech extends beyond race, something that Riley likely also knows—he is a member of Mike Bloomberg’s coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Riley has already spoken many of the right words—saying, of the victims, “We will work to heal them, and love them, and support them, and that church, as long as we live,” and, after the arrest, “In America, we don’t let bad people like this get away with this dastardly deed.” Governor Nikki Haley spoke after Riley and, as she, too, spoke about healing, she broke down crying. Other politicians, from Hillary Clinton, who had just left Charleston when the shooting occurred, to Jeb Bush, who, with the shooter still not in custody, cancelled a visit to the city, will have to be part of that conversation, too, as Charleston takes on, above all, the task of supporting the victims of this shooting and their survivors. There is, though, more for them to say, about demons that have not only been abruptly visited on this city, or this country—“incomprehensible” to both—but those who have long inhabited it.","2312","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/dylann-roof-and-a-night-of-hate-in-charleston"

I’m glad the train didn’t stop.” In his other remarks, he expressed sympathy for the police and blamed the violence on ”the breakdown of the family structure, the lack of fathers, the lack of sort of a moral code in our society,” but nothing he said was particularly insightful, and, in any case, it was overshadowed by his tasteless attempt at a joke. He didn’t speak at all to the circumstances surrounding Gray’s death, his own support for sentencing reform, or the long history of poverty and deprivation in parts of Baltimore.","2321","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-presidential-race-freddie-gray-baltimore"

He defended the “broken windows” model of policing pioneered by Rudy Giuliani. He bemoaned the “pathologies being built around people who are poor, that they’re going to stay poor,” and asked, “How do you create a system of support that doesn’t create dependency?” He also praised Toya Graham, the Baltimore mother who was videotaped smacking her sixteen-year-old son for joining the rioters: “It was a nice visual symbol of what needs to be restored.”","2322","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-presidential-race-freddie-gray-baltimore"

The people who have been paying the biggest price have been the minority communities.” Having offered these measured comments, however, Cruz couldn’t resist taking some potshots at President Obama, whom he accused of fomenting racial tensions. The President “had the opportunity to be a unifying President, to try to bring people together,” Cruz said. “Rather, his Administration, it seems, constantly seeks to divide, to turn us against each other … based on race, based on sex, based on wealth, based on geography.”","2323","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/g-o-p-presidential-race-freddie-gray-baltimore"

"A few minutes before six o’clock on Friday evening, a passenger on board a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris took his suitcase into the bathroom. He emerged armed with an AK-47. There were more than five hundred passengers on board, and the gunman had several clips of ammunition. Mark Moogalian, a French-American academic teaching at the Sorbonne, managed to wrest the rifle from the attacker’s hands. He turned to his wife, and the gunman drew a pistol and shot him in the neck. This awoke another passenger, U.S. Airman Spencer Stone, who followed the gunman down the aisle and tackled him to the ground. The gunman fought back with a box-cutter until Stone’s companions, Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler, beat the attacker unconscious. With the help of a fifth man, Chris Norman, a British consultant, they tied the gunman down while Stone tried to keep Moogalian from bleeding to death. “I think he really saved my husband’s life,” Moogalian’s wife later said. According to another passenger, the train’s staff had locked themselves into a separate compartment. On Monday, François Hollande, the French President, awarded Stone, Skarlatos, Sadler, and Norman the Légion d’Honneur. Moogalian, who is still in the hospital, will receive it later, along with an unnamed French banker who also attempted to subdue the gunman.","August 27, 2015","2328","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/security-and-the-european-union"
"French prosecutors have charged Ayoub El-Khazzani, a Moroccan national who is alleged to have been the gunman, with terrorism. Multiple governments were aware that El-Khazzani was a potential risk, and Spain had reportedly warned France that he had links to violent extremists and had recently travelled to Syria. French security had his name on a five-thousand-person watch list, the same watch list that contained the names of the Charlie Hebdo attackers, prior to their attack. According to German security services, El-Khazzani flew from Berlin to Istanbul last May, and he could have headed from there toward the Syrian border. Nevertheless, El-Khazzani was sold a first-class train ticket and allowed to board the train in Brussels with an unsearched bag. Khazzani told his lawyer that the motive for the attack was robbery, not terrorism, and that he found the weapons in the park where he spent the night before boarding.","2329","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/security-and-the-european-union"
"The other passengers had the training, the numbers, and the will to intervene and prevent Khazzani’s attack. But, in addition to applauding their bravery, it’s worth asking how a suspected jihadist known to at least three governments wound up onboard a high-speed train with a suitcase full of weaponry. One answer is that the European Union effectively protected his freedom of movement. France is part of the Schengen Area, which stretches from Portugal to Finland (and eastward to Greece), where E.U. citizens can usually travel without submitting to passport checks. The tens of thousands of asylum seekers who travel through Europe and the threat of terrorism have made Schengen’s openness more controversial. Compared to the United States, Europe has a larger population of potentially violent jihadists and less centralized authority with which to monitor them. After Friday’s shooting, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel proposed that the borderless Schengen regime would have to change. “We have to be ready to sacrifice certain freedoms in the interest of fighting terrorism,” he said. However, on Monday, President Hollande suggested that preventing terrorism is ultimately the responsibility of individuals as much as the state, “men and women capable of doing the right thing under the right circumstances.” This echoed Hollande’s statements after the Charlie Hebdo attack, which emphasized solidarity and the defense of French values more than heightened security measures.","2330","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/security-and-the-european-union"
"It’s hard to imagine an American politician positing that individual citizens ultimately are responsible for thwarting terrorist attacks. We are proud individualists when it comes to economic matters, but we refuse to tolerate any risk to our security. After 9/11, this manifested itself as what journalist Ron Suskind described as “the One Percent doctrine” or the “Cheney doctrine,” the notion that even a very slight chance of catastrophe must be treated “as a certainty,” and preëmpted. Regarding evidence, Suskind wrote in 2007, “the bar was set so low that the word itself almost didn’t apply. If there was even a one percent chance of terrorists getting a weapon of mass destruction—and there has been a small probability of such an occurence for some time—the United States must now act as if it were a certainty. This was a mandate of extraordinary breadth.”","2331","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/security-and-the-european-union"
"Politicians have found different ways to describe their adherence to this doctrine. The standard line is not that we are choosing security over civil liberties but rather that we are engaging in technocratic “balancing.” “With liberty and security, it’s not that the more you have of one, the less you have of the other,” Hillary Clinton writes in her new memoir. “In fact I believe they make each other possible.” This echoes White House statements about the “balance between security and liberty,” although President Obama has at times come close to acknowledging that prioritizing security requires some invasive and pre-emptive measures. “You can’t have one hundred percent security and also have one hundred percent privacy and zero inconvenience,” Obama said in an unscripted Q. & A., shortly after Edward Snowden’s first disclosures. “We’re going to have to make some choices as a society.” This, of course, is apparent to anyone who has walked barefoot through a millimetre-wave scanner.","2332","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/security-and-the-european-union"
"When it comes to government, the relationship between security and freedom isn’t a balancing act. It’s a tug-of-war. Every inch obtained by one side must be given up by the other. “You can’t enjoy your civil liberties if you’re in a coffin,” New Jersey governor Chris Christie said in May, arguing in his typically blunt way that the government should have more counterterrorism powers.","2333","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/security-and-the-european-union"
"The government can spy on those it deems likely to become terrorists, roll up their networks afterwards, or use provocateurs to push credulous suspects into committing a crime. What it can’t do is cover every watch-listed suspect and every soft target twenty-four hours a day. It’s hard to imagine a law that would let the government eliminate the last one per cent of risk. “We’ve been lucky,” an intelligence source recently told a French newspaper. “We’ve already tried everything. But we’ve reached the very limits of what we are able to do.” Beyond that limit, counterterrorism falls to those who happen to be nearby, whether any sheepdogs are present to hold off the lone wolf.","2334","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/security-and-the-european-union"
"Like many people in the criminal-justice system, John Chisholm, the District Attorney in Milwaukee County, has been concerned for a long time about the racial imbalance in American prisons. The issue is especially salient in Wisconsin, where African-Americans constitute only six per cent of the population but thirty-seven per cent of those in state prison. According to a study from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, as of 2010 thirteen per cent of the state’s African-American men of working age were behind bars—nearly double the national average, of 6.7 per cent. The figures were especially stark for Milwaukee County, where more than half of African-American men in their thirties had served time in state prison. How, Chisholm wondered, did the work of his own office contribute to these numbers? Could a D.A. do anything to change them?","2335","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"The recent spate of deaths of unarmed African-Americans at the hands of police officers has brought renewed attention to racial inequality in criminal justice, but in the U.S. legal system prosecutors may wield even more power than cops. Prosecutors decide whether to bring a case or drop charges against a defendant; charge a misdemeanor or a felony; demand a prison sentence or accept probation. Most cases are resolved through plea bargains, where prosecutors, not judges, negotiate whether and for how long a defendant goes to prison. And prosecutors make these judgments almost entirely outside public scrutiny.","2336","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Chisholm decided to let independent researchers examine how he used his prosecutorial discretion. In 2007, when he took office, the Vera Institute of Justice, a research and policy group based in New York City, had just begun studying the racial implications of the work of the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s office. Over several years, Chisholm allowed the researchers to question his staff members and look at their files. The conclusions were disturbing. According to the Vera study, prosecutors in Milwaukee declined to prosecute forty-one per cent of whites arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, compared with twenty-seven per cent of blacks; in cases involving prostitution, black female defendants were likelier to be charged than white defendants; in cases that involved resisting or obstructing an officer, most of the defendants charged were black (seventy-seven per cent), male (seventy-nine per cent), and already in custody (eighty per cent of blacks versus sixty-six per cent of whites).","2337","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Chisholm decided that his office would undertake initiatives to try to send fewer people to prison while maintaining public safety. “For a long time, prosecutors have defined themselves through conviction rates and winning the big cases with the big sentences,” Nicholas Turner, the president of the Vera Institute, told me. “But the evidence is certainly tipping that the attainment of safety and justice requires more than just putting people in prison for a long time. Prosecutors have to redefine their proper role in a new era. Chisholm stuck his neck out there and started saying that prosecutors should also be judged by their success in reducing mass incarceration and achieving racial equality.” Chisholm’s efforts have drawn attention around the country. “John is a national leader in law enforcement, because he is genuinely interested in trying to achieve the right results, not only in individual cases but in larger policy issues as well,” Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., the Manhattan District Attorney, told me.","2338","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Chisholm reflects a growing national sentiment that the criminal-justice system has failed African-Americans. The events in Baltimore last week drew, at least in part, on a sense there that black people have paid an undue price for the crackdown on crime. Since 1980, Maryland’s prison population has tripled, to about twenty-one thousand, and, as in Wisconsin, there is a distressing racial disparity among inmates. The population of Maryland is about thirty per cent black; the prisons and local jails are more than seventy per cent black.","2339","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"In 2013, former Attorney General Eric Holder announced an initiative, known as Smart on Crime, that directed federal prosecutors to take steps toward reducing the number of people sentenced to federal prisons and the lengths of the sentences. “Prison is very costly—to individuals, to the government, and to communities,” Jonathan Wroblewski, a Justice Department official who was part of the Smart on Crime team, told me. “We want to explore alternatives.” By 2014, federal prosecutors were seeking mandatory minimum sentences in only half of their drug-trafficking cases, down from two-thirds the previous year. The number of these prosecutions inched downward as well.","2340","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"

It’s an ethic that should extend throughout our criminal-justice system. To prosecutors and parole officers. To judges and lawmakers. We all share a responsibility to help re-stitch the fabric of our neighborhoods and communities.” She added, “It’s time to end the era of mass incarceration.”","2342","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"

Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin and a presumptive Republican Presidential candidate, is a fierce ideological adversary. Chisholm, a Democrat, who is fifty-two, and Walker, who is forty-seven, both grew up in the state and both attended Marquette University, in Milwaukee. Both have spent virtually their entire lives working for state and local government in Wisconsin. As a state legislator, Walker pursued a traditional law-and-order agenda, and he sponsored bills that sought to increase mandatory minimum sentences for a variety of crimes. He became a statewide figure by sponsoring Wisconsin’s “Truth in Sentencing” legislation, which increased prison time and abolished parole for certain offenders. As governor, Walker has continued to oppose parole opportunities for prisoners. In 2010, the year before he took office, the state granted thirteen per cent of parole requests; in 2013, only six per cent were granted.

In addition to the city, Milwaukee County includes more than a dozen suburbs, most of which are predominantly white. “When I first saw the data, I thought, Here is some good news,” Chisholm told me. “It said that we charge white offenders for property crimes at a higher rate than we do black offenders for those kinds of cases. So I thought, Good, here is a disparity the other way. That must balance things out. But a deputy of mine pointed out that what the data really meant was that we devalue property crimes in the center city. We don’t charge a car theft, because we think it’s just some junker car that’s broken down anyway. It meant that we were devaluing our African-American victims of property crimes—so that was another thing to address.”","2348","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Chisholm decided to move to what he calls an evidence-driven public-health model. “What’s the most effective way to keep a community healthy?” he asked. “You protect people in the first place. But then what do you do with the people who are arrested?” There are two basic models of prosecutorial philosophy. “In one, you are a case processor,” he said. “You take what is brought to you by law-enforcement agencies, and you move those cases fairly and efficiently through the system. But if you want to make a difference you have to do more than process cases.”","2349","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"So Chisholm began stationing prosecutors in neighborhoods around Milwaukee. “If people view prosecutors as just the guys in the courthouse, who are concerned only with getting convictions, then you are creating a barrier,” he said. He and his team started asking themselves in every instance why they were bringing that case. “In those that were seen as minor, it was the least experienced people who were deciding whether to bring them. And these people saw that we had generally brought those cases in the past, so they went ahead with them again. But we started to ask, ‘Why are we charging these people with crimes at all?’ ”","2350","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"In 2010, Michelle Alexander, a professor at the Ohio State University School of Law, published “The New Jim Crow,” a study of mass incarceration among African-Americans. Like many influential works, the book identified trends that had been apparent for some time. Alexander noted that the prison population in the United States had grown from roughly three hundred thousand, in the early nineteen-seventies, to two million, after 2000. “The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world, dwarfing the rates of nearly every developed country, even surpassing those in highly repressive regimes like Russia, China and Iran,” she wrote. Moreover, “the racial dimension of mass incarceration is its most striking feature.”","2351","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"This critique has grown in intensity in recent years. “Mass incarceration is ahistorical, criminogenic, inefficient, and racist,” Paul Butler, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, told me. “Throughout much of American history, we incarcerated about one hundred people per one hundred thousand people in the population. After the eighties, it moved to six hundred or seven hundred per hundred thousand. Prisons are finishing schools for criminals, so they breed more crime. They cost a fortune to maintain. And the racism of the process just starts with drug crimes. Black people don’t use drugs more than anyone else, but, with thirteen per cent of the population, black people make up close to forty per cent of inmates serving time for drug offenses.”","2352","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Some prominent Republicans also have begun to criticize current policies. The Koch brothers have funded work by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers which aims, among other things, at limiting mandatory minimum sentences in drug cases, and, in a broad effort to reduce prison sentences, they have joined forces with such unlikely allies as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for American Progress. Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator and Republican Presidential candidate, has sponsored a bill with Cory Booker, the New Jersey Democrat, that would allow youthful offenders more opportunities to expunge criminal records.","2353","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Scott Walker has shown little interest in joining this movement. For the most part, he has focussed his administration on tax cuts and budget cuts (especially for higher education) and on a successful battle against public-employee unions in his state. In terms of criminal justice, Walker’s primary effort has been to expand gun rights. In 2011, he signed a law that allowed people to carry concealed firearms and one that endorsed the “castle doctrine,” a presumption that homeowners act lawfully if they shoot an intruder on their premises. Chisholm opposed these measures.","2354","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"One of the difficulties of criminal-justice reform is that power is spread so diffusely through the system. “Criminal justice is a system, and no one person or group is in charge of it,” Alfred Blumstein, a professor at Carnegie-Mellon University, told me. “You have legislators who decide what’s a crime and establish the range of penalties. You have judges who impose the sentences. You have police who decide whom to arrest. And you have prosecutors who have wide discretion in what cases to bring, what charges to call for, and what sentences to agree to in plea bargains.” Each of those participants has contributed to the rise in incarceration. “Are more people in prison because there is more crime?” Blumstein asked. “More arrests per crime? Better policing? Longer sentences imposed by judges? More mandatory minimum sentences established by legislatures? Tougher decisions by parole boards?”","2355","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Blumstein and others place some of the responsibility for mass incarceration on lawmakers who, in the nineteen-eighties and nineties, dramatically increased sentences, especially for narcotics offenses. When Congress revised federal sentencing guidelines, in the nineteen-eighties, it not only increased the length of most prison terms but established a sentencing disparity of a hundred to one between crack cocaine, often used by blacks, and powdered cocaine, favored by whites. (A 2010 revision of the law lowered the disparity to eighteen to one.)","2356","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"But a recent quantitative analysis by John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School, who also has a Ph.D. in economics, argues that sentencing laws are not the main reason for the increase in the prison population. “For all the tougher sentencing laws, there is not much more time served in prison per prisoner,” he told me. “Prisoners are serving about the same amount of time now as they did in the eighties.” Rather, Pfaff points to prosecutors—more than cops, judges, or legislators—as the principal drivers of the increase in the prison population. “The real change is in the chances that a felony arrest by the police turns into a felony case brought by prosecutors,” he said.","2357","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"How this change came about defies easy explanations. The United States Department of Justice, through its U.S. Attorneys, plays a relatively small role in incarceration. Federal prisoners amount to just over ten per cent of the total prisoner count in the country. There are roughly twenty-three hundred different local prosecutorial offices in the United States; most prosecutors are elected independently; and the lead lawyer in each office has considerable discretion in setting policies. In New York City, each borough elects its own district attorney, and the D.A.s’ policies differ, sometimes significantly. (Kenneth P. Thompson, the Brooklyn District Attorney, has effectively decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana, while the city’s four other D.A.s have not.) Still, as Pfaff said, “if you are going to reduce the prison population, prosecutors are going to be the ones who have to lead the way.”","2358","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"The most significant innovation in Chisholm’s overhaul of the office involves an “early intervention” program, which begins after a defendant is arrested but before arraignment. Each defendant is given an eight-question assessment, which can be conducted in about fifteen minutes and is compared to the information on the rap sheet and in the police report. The questions include: “Two or more prior adult convictions?” “Arrested under age sixteen?” “Currently unemployed?” “Some criminal friends?” A low score can lead to an offer of “diversion”—a kind of unofficial probation that, if successfully completed, leaves the individual without a criminal record. A high score leads to a second, more detailed, fifty-four-question assessment. The questions include: “Ever walked away/escaped from a halfway house?” “Were you ever suspended or expelled from school?” “Does your financial situation contribute to your stress?” “Tell me the best thing about your supervisor/teacher.” Results of the assessment may also lead to diversion or may lead to a more intensive kind of post-arrest supervision, known as deferred prosecution. People in this group will maintain a criminal record of an arrest but may have their charges reduced or dismissed. To participate in these incarceration alternatives, a defendant must commit to completing drug-treatment or other educational programs that are approved by Chisholm’s office.","2359","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"“The whole program is designed to reduce the number of people we are putting in jail or prison, but to do it in a smart, accountable way,” Jeffrey Altenburg, a deputy district attorney, who oversees the early-intervention program, told me. “It’s to get people back on track, based on their risk and their need.” Every week, Altenburg, an eighteen-year veteran of the D.A.’s office, conducts a series of informal meetings with people in the diversion and deferred-prosecution programs who are in danger of being thrown out and returned to the traditional criminal-justice system.","2360","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"A man I’ll call John was the first offender at a recent hearing, which took place in a subdivided conference room in the Safety Building. Altenburg was joined by a lawyer from the public defender’s office and a case manager from an outside agency. At nineteen, John had already spent a year in juvenile detention, for robbery, and his recent arrest was for possession of marijuana. He had reported to the program supervisor that he had used Percocet without a prescription. “I don’t have an addiction problem,” he said. “It’s more choices and decision-making.” He was praised for reporting his violation, and told to attend a class on decision-making and return to the committee in two weeks. The case officer noted that John’s girlfriend was pregnant. “Of course,” the public defender muttered.","2361","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Jane, a fifty-two-year-old who was in diversion for shoplifting, had failed her fifth breathalyzer test for alcohol and tested positive for cocaine, but she had maintained her community-service obligation at the Salvation Army. “You’ve been in this program a long time,” Altenburg said to her. “You have shown the ability to improve. You can get through this program. You need to work on your addiction.” She promised to continue counselling.","2362","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"

Altenburg noted that Joe had committed other violations, and revoked his participation in the program. He would be convicted of felony burglary.","2363","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"

"Efforts by Chisholm and others to keep low-level offenders out of prison represent the core of the criminal-justice-reform movement—and these initiatives are passionately opposed by traditional law-and-order advocates. “The new mantra from the reformers is for ‘evidence-based’ solutions and assessments to determine who is low risk, and then we find that some of them go out and slaughter people,” Michael Rushford, the president of the right-leaning Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which publishes a widely read blog called Crime and Consequences, told me. “What the reformers never want to talk about is that, in the eighties and nineties, once we incarcerated a lot of people, the crime rate went down dramatically around the country.” He went on, “Over the past ten years, we’ve been winning the war of attrition on crime, because the deterrent effect works. People don’t commit crimes, because they don’t want to go to prison. The reformers are teaching the opposite lesson. If a guy is stealing cars, and finds that he’s never going to go to prison for stealing cars, what do you think he’s going to do? He’s going to steal a lot of cars and then move on to stealing something else.” It is true that the over-all level of crime has fallen in the United States over the past two decades, but the debate over whether mass incarceration is the reason for this decline has been inconclusive.","2366","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"At the local level, Chisholm’s aversion to incarceration has drawn the ire of probably the best-known law-enforcement figure in Milwaukee (and the only African-American in a senior position), David A. Clarke, Jr., who has been the sheriff of Milwaukee County since 2002. Clarke, whose responsibilities include supervising local jails, has a dashing public profile, thanks in part to a penchant for topping his black uniform with a cowboy hat. On Clarke’s campaign Web site, he states, “My soft-on-crime opponents emerge from Candy Land to propose second chances, third chances, and fourth chances, in the process endangering our homes, neighborhoods, and schools.” When I talked with him in his office, which is also in the Safety Building, he drank coffee from a cup bearing a portrait of John Wayne.","2367","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Clarke told me, “Their whole movement comes up with these cutesy phrases—‘those who scare us, those who irritate us’—but those who violate society’s rules over time need to pay the price. They need to be punished for their misbehavior. That’s how you change behavior.” In particular, Clarke opposes Chisholm’s predisposition for drug-treatment programs rather than jail or prison. “I’m not for government-funded drug-rehab programs,” he said. “These individuals are making this choice. Those programs de-motivate people to address their own problems. So don’t expect me to pay for your drug rehab. Find your own through the private sector.”","2368","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Clarke believes that Chisholm’s effort to reduce incarceration hurts those it’s intended to help. “In the communities where most crime takes place, we do not have the support structures in place for social alternatives to incarceration. So you are putting them back into the community to claim more black victims. If you want to let people back on the street, you have to think about the people who are going to be dealing with them—my people, black people. What I’ve heard recently with criminal-justice reform is simply normalizing criminal behavior in a community that can least afford it—the ghettos.”","2369","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Wisconsin has some of the most polarized politics in the country, and Clarke is a close ally of Scott Walker’s. The split between Chisholm and Walker has been exacerbated by a long-running investigation by Chisholm of Walker’s staff when Walker was the Milwaukee County Executive. The initial part of the investigation, which is known as the John Doe case, led to the conviction of six Walker aides, on charges ranging from theft to campaigning on government time. Since 2012, Walker’s staff has been investigated for possible violations of campaign-finance laws by working too closely with outside groups, like the Club for Growth, which were advocating on his behalf. The investigation has been stalled since last year, and the Club for Growth sued Chisholm and his subordinates in both their professional and their individual capacities, on the ground that they had violated the free-speech rights of Walker’s supporters. (The case is now on appeal.) Chisholm says that he can’t comment on the investigation.","2370","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Advocacy for Walker in the Doe case has become a cause célèbre in conservative circles. “Some truly outrageous things have gone on in the state of Wisconsin that have happened as part of the effort to destroy Scott Walker,” Rush Limbaugh said on his radio broadcast last month. “It was the kind of thing that Vladimir Putin does and we all laugh about because that’s what we expect in a tyrannical dictatorship like the Soviet Union or Russia. We find out that it can happen here and has happened here, and there was no mechanism to stop it. The prosecutor’s name is Chisholm, John Chisholm, and I hope his name is never forgotten.”","2371","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"The vast majority of the murders in Milwaukee take place on the north side, which is overwhelmingly African-American, with an unemployment rate above forty per cent. In 2014, there were eighty-seven homicides in Milwaukee, which has a population of just under six hundred thousand. If New York City had Milwaukee’s murder rate, there would have been more than twelve hundred homicides in 2014; the actual number was three hundred and twenty-eight. In Milwaukee, this year has got off to a dismal start. By the end of April, there were forty-eight homicides. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted in a recent headline, “How could this happen? No easy answers to Milwaukee’s spiraling violence.” Chisholm told me, “This last patch has been a tough one.”","2372","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Since 2008, the police chief in Milwaukee has been Edward Flynn, who is sixty-six years old and a longtime ally of New York’s police commissioner, William Bratton. Like Bratton, he relies on crime data to direct officers to the most dangerous neighborhoods. “The reality for urban police practitioners is that we respond to the overwhelming victimization of black people,” Flynn told me. “Every community meeting I go to in an African-American neighborhood is fuelled by demands for more effective police services. The sad fact is that most violent offenders look like their victims. So that means everything we do is going to have a disparate impact on communities of color.”","2373","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"When I took a drive around north Milwaukee with Jacob Corr and Christopher Ladwig, community-based prosecutors in Chisholm’s office, and Patrick Fuhrman, a sixteen-year veteran of the police force, in an unmarked car, they insisted that I wear a bulletproof vest. Corr was an early enlistee among Chisholm’s lawyers in the field and, for a decade, has been assigned to the police station in north Milwaukee. “I’m a six-foot-four-inch bald white guy,” he told me. “It was going to take me a while to generate trust here.” In Ladwig’s office were maps of the neighborhood marked with red dots for major crimes and blue dots for non-fatal shootings. He relies on data from “shot spotter” technology, which alerts the police every time a gun is fired in certain areas of the city; it goes off about eighteen times a day. Even in poor neighborhoods, Milwaukee still has a lot of sturdy housing, built in the early twentieth century, but the streets around Washington Park, a couple of blocks from Ladwig’s office, bear signs of trouble. Most commerce takes place in “corner stores,” as convenience stores are called here. They do a steady business in Jackpot cigars, which are emptied and filled with marijuana, and Chore Boy scrubbers, which can be used to make crack-pipe filters.","2374","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"The prosecutors’ duties go well beyond those of traditional prosecutors. In 2011, Ladwig helped persuade Habitat for Humanity to renovate some houses on a block in a particularly crime-ridden neighborhood, and the crime rate dropped precipitously. Ladwig has also worked closely with the Benedict Center, a nonprofit agency in the same neighborhood that is dedicated to helping both female victims of crime, usually domestic violence, and female offenders, usually prostitutes. Ladwig and his colleagues found that prostitutes who were treated at the Benedict Center had a better chance of staying off the street than those who were arrested. In a rare example of collaboration between Chisholm and Walker, in 2013 the Governor provided more than ten million dollars in funding for the Sojourner Family Peace Center, a nonprofit in Milwaukee that helps victims of domestic violence.","2375","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Back at the district police station, the magnitude of Milwaukee’s problems comes into focus. One afternoon, Mallory O’Brien, an epidemiologist affiliated with the Medical College of Wisconsin, convened a meeting of the Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission, which she directs. Once a month, O’Brien brings together cops, prosecutors, parole agents, and judges to conduct brainstorming sessions about recent homicides in the area. Together, they suggest ideas about how the violence might be prevented. “For years, the federal government has had a review commission to look at every death on the highway and see what can be learned from it,” O’Brien told me. “We’re using the same idea for shootings in Milwaukee.” After a series of crimes committed by people who had returned from prison, the review group helped create a team of officers and parole agents who visit parolees’ families before and after they are released, to ease the transition.","2376","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Six homicides were reviewed at the meeting I attended, and they all seemed like variations on the same dismal theme. A drug transaction was planned or consummated. A dispute arose, usually near a bar. Suspect and/or victim were drunk or high. Shots were fired. All parties, including the witnesses, were African-American. More than eighty per cent of both the perpetrators and the victims of Milwaukee homicides have criminal records.","2377","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"This inventory from the homicide-review panel illustrates the limits of Chisholm’s efforts. To some extent, he has succeeded in his goals. There are many fewer prosecutions of both blacks and whites for low-level drug offenses. Chisholm has stopped bringing cases for possession of drug paraphernalia, which were at the heart of the original Vera study. On his watch, the over-all number of misdemeanor prosecutions in the county has dropped from nine thousand to fifty-two hundred. Likewise, once Chisholm instituted a policy that all burglary-case filings must be approved by a senior prosecutor, the disparity that led to more cases against white alleged thieves than black ones faded. The number of African-American residents of Milwaukee County sent to state prison on drug charges has been cut in half since 2006.","2378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"Still, Chisholm acknowledged that cases involving gun violence or homicide inevitably skew attempts to redress racial imbalances in incarceration. “Almost all of our shootings and almost all of our homicides are black-on-black crime, and that’s an enormous problem,” he told me. The prison population in Wisconsin has dropped from roughly twenty-four thousand five hundred, in 2007, to twenty-two thousand today, and most of the reduction has come from Milwaukee County. Still, the change in the racial makeup of the prison population has been modest. Chisholm said, “We’re no longer sending low-level drug offenders to state prison, but we are still sending violent criminals, and that’s keeping the African-American numbers up. If we do this right, the people who are going to prison should be going to prison. The people who are going to prison are dangerous.”","2379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"
"To explain this year’s crime rise, as well as the persistent racial disparities, Chisholm cites forces beyond his control—poverty, hopelessness, lack of education, drug addiction, and the easy availability of guns. In this way, Chisholm’s greatest lesson may have been in humility. “We redesigned our system, but we learned that no individual actor can change the dynamics of what goes on in a complex larger system like a city,” he said. ♦","2380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/the-milwaukee-experiment"

"Implacable Resolution: The increasingly familiar chin-up, narrow-eyed Mussolini frown. When Trump listens to a hostile question, his lips are closed, his head squares up to a solid block of orange clay, his corn-silk hair surges resolutely forward and backward at the same time. Expressionless, he nods as the hostile sentence is delivered. By evoking Mussolini’s thrusting chin, I don’t mean to imply that Trump is eager to become a military dictator. He isn’t. Donald Trump is something classically American, an unwavering what’s-in-it-for-me capitalist who likes to crush other people. Yet Mussolini and Trump share something: They appeal to an appreciation, even love, of overwhelming ego strength and extreme machismo, however crass in expression—in fact, the crasser and more preposterous the better (shame doesn’t exist for some public men). Those who are drawn to such strength nestle under it. The hero releases his aggression on the world, the aggression that others would be punished for; his ability to get away with belligerence, insults, lies, and threats makes it easier for his audience to accept caution and silence for themselves. He has triumphed for them, and that’s more than enough.","2382","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Trump’s emotional appeal is similar to that of gangsters everywhere, who act out our most violent and anarchic impulses. In a variant interpretation, Elspeth Reeve, at The New Republic, compared Trump not to a gangster but to the “heel” in pro-wrestling matches—the bad guy whose boasts and offensive behavior and barbarian facial hair are part of a ritual that audiences love. But that isn’t quite right. Professional wrestling is scripted, and Trump is spontaneous and improvisatory. In wrestling, the bad guy always loses, and Trump always wins. He is impervious and unremitting. If he says something stupid, he denies he said it—for instance, his suggestion that Megyn Kelly’s tough questions in the recent Fox-hosted Republican debate were produced by menstruation. Trump went to Wharton, he built a great business, he’s intelligent, so how could he have said it? He didn’t say it. His audience loves him not in spite of such “gaffes” as slamming John McCain’s war record; they love him because he says such things. The senselessness of the McCain attack was essential to its popularity. Trump’s speeches and press conferences are a free-association shambles, his “ideas” a series of boasts. When asked, on Tuesday, how he would bring jobs back from China, he talked about buying a hotel in Miami. For his audience, the only thing that matters is that he asserts himself. Reasoning and consistency are élitist weaknesses.","2383","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Beneath Contempt. His mouth drops down and forms a slightly elongated oval, like a stretched Cheerio. The oval is a prelude to a taunt or a threat. When Kelly asked Trump about his derogatory comments on women, he responded, “What I say is what I say. And honestly, Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry. I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn’t do that.” But he would do it, and continued to do it. Donald Trump has made a shrewd estimate of the distaste, in a part of the Republican base, for virtue or high-mindedness or public spiritedness of any sort—what he dismisses as “political correctness.” Such sentiments are for “losers” who don’t understand that winning is the only thing; they are “stupid.” Obama’s mild reasonableness is particularly enraging to members of the Republican base because they suspect the President is outclassing them. Trump releases them from that fear.","2384","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"You-gotta-be-kidding-me. A wide smile, eyes often closed, palms outstretched. In such moments, Trump presents himself as capitalist man, the spirit of rational calculation. Only an idiot could fail to see that he’s right. When asked by Bret Baier, in the debate, about his past support for Hillary Clinton, Trump responded, “I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.” So his own behavior is part of a corrupt system. The important point for him is not the degradation of representative democracy, but only that Trump gets what he wants. Having won, he can laugh at his own cynicism.","2385","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"Trump’s manner is the product of business calculation. But many Americans may not realize how much Trump’s voice and gestures are also shaped by New York—the old, hard New York, before gay rights, smoothies, and Brooklyn, the New York that Trump and I grew up in. His temperament is the residue of a thousand wise-guy tabloid columns, the knowing talk of Seventh-Avenue machers and Irish taxi drivers and mobbed-up guys in the outer boroughs. The flavor of it was there, harmlessly, in the lather-and-hot-towels midtown barber shops of my youth, with their uniformed women attending to gents’ cuticles; benevolently, in the incomparable Broadway musical “Guys and Dolls”; and viciously, in the A.M.-radio rat-a-tat of Walter Winchell. Men like Trump always cut to the chase because, for them, there’s nothing but the chase; they cite the bottom line because it’s the only line that matters; they put down women because there’s no reason, most of the time, to take them seriously. If a woman somehow does attain power, they assume she will use it to destroy men. In Megyn Kelly, Trump sees some golden-haired modern variant of Medusa.","2386","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"People are constantly surprised and shocked by Trump because he doesn’t play by any known set of political rules. Even the three formidable Fox moderators (including Chris Wallace) were limited in their understanding of him by what they expected of political candidates—acknowledgment of some minimal level of consistency, plausibility, and accountability. They thought they could trip him up, even trap him, Tim Russert-style, in his contradictions and political changes. But he answered them with gibberish—silly jokes, non sequiturs, and irrelevant assertions. It’s impossible for Trump to contradict himself, since, as many have said, he has no beliefs, in the sense of ideological beliefs.","2387","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"He exploited the country’s bankruptcy laws when his hotel-casino investments in Atlantic City went sour, and anyway, he got out early and made a lot of money. Got it? He made money. A single-payer system, often known as socialized medicine, “works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you’re talking about here.” (i.e., fifteen years ago). Got it? It works. But the Affordable Care Act, which could be seen as a hesitant first step toward a single-payer system, “is a disaster.” You can’t argue with reasoning like this because it always circles back to Trump’s triumphs over the naïve. He’s gone past contradiction, beyond tautology, into infallibility. In advance of the debate, he stopped studying policy papers. He doesn’t need answers; his temperament is the answer. My guess is that he will persist as long as he’s having fun, not spending much of his own money, and enjoying high poll numbers. Which could be right into the primaries next winter. The Republican Party and the media can’t begin to understand him until they look at his face.","2388","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-three-faces-of-trump"
"In the mid-nineteen-eighties, shortly after the convictions of six members of the House of Representatives and one senator in the F.B.I. bribery sting code-named Abscam, one of the bureau’s anticorruption units turned its attention to the California legislature, where an informant had reported that lawmakers were on the take. Agents posing as representatives of a shrimp-processing company announced plans to build a plant near Sacramento, provided that a state-loan guarantee could be procured. They offered to reward legislators who would help secure their financing. The operation, inevitably, was known as Shrimpscam.","2389","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Patrick J. Nolan, an earnest law-and-order conservative representing Glendale and Burbank, was the leader of the Republican minority in the assembly. He had already voted for a bill making the company eligible for the guarantee, but Governor George Deukmejian, who was aware of the sting, had vetoed it. Now one of the agents wanted to meet Nolan to entice him to intercede with Deukmejian. On June 29, 1988, Nolan and a legislative aide, Karin Watson, arrived at a bugged suite in the Sacramento Hyatt Regency, across from the Capitol. They declined the agent’s offer of champagne (it was not yet noon) in favor of Diet Pepsi, admired the view, engaged in some awkward small talk, and left twenty minutes later, with two five-thousand-dollar checks. One was made out to a Republican campaign committee. The other was left blank, apparently to see if Nolan would pocket the money. He filled in the name of a Party PAC.","2390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Pat Nolan now lives outside Washington, D.C., in Leesburg, Virginia. Recently, he rummaged in his basement for a copy of the F.B.I. audiotape of the meeting. (There was a video, but Nolan’s copy seems to have got lost when he moved east, in 1996.) Nothing on the muddy soundtrack, which plays today like an outtake from “American Hustle,” is explicitly transactional, but the agent presses for help in changing the Governor’s mind, and Nolan explains that it would be beneficial for business in general if Republicans could capture a majority in the assembly.","2391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The sting eventually resulted in a dozen indictments, but it took five years, and Karin Watson’s coöperation, for prosecutors to file charges against Nolan. On April 27, 1993, he was indicted on six counts, including racketeering, conspiracy, extortion, and money laundering. Nolan insists that he voted for the loan because the fictional venture promised jobs, and that he took the contributions because that’s how people help elect legislators who see things their way. But Nolan’s lawyers concluded that a public that had recently endured the scandals of Watergate, Abscam, and Iran-Contra would not be sympathetic to a politician’s claim that he was just doing his job. Nolan calculated that, if found guilty, he could be in prison until his young children were in their twenties. So he quit his seat and admitted to one felony count of racketeering in exchange for a sentence of thirty-three months.","2392","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Criminal-justice reformers like to say that if a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged, a liberal is a conservative who has served time. Nolan did not emerge from prison any less conservative, but he says he experienced a profound disillusionment, which has led him to play a central role in a cause that is only now finding its moment. These days, it is hard to ignore a rising conservative clamor to rehabilitate the criminal-justice system. Conservatives are as quick as liberals to note that the United States, a country with less than five per cent of the world’s population, houses nearly twenty-five per cent of the world’s prisoners. Some 2.2 million Americans are now incarcerated—about triple the number locked up in the nineteen-eighties, when, in a panic over drugs and urban crime, conservative legislators demanded tougher policies, and liberals who feared being portrayed as weak went along with them. African-Americans are nearly six times as likely as whites to be incarcerated, and Latinos are more than twice as likely. More than forty per cent of released offenders return to prison within three years.","2393","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Several Republican Presidential candidates—Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, and Ted Cruz—have been embraced by Right on Crime, a campaign to promote “successful, conservative solutions” to the punitive excesses of American law and order. In February, the American Conservative Union’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which serves as an audition for right-wing Presidential aspirants, featured three panels on criminal-justice reform, including one called Prosecutors Gone Wild. Bernard Kerik, who was Rudolph Giuliani’s police commissioner and served three years in prison for tax fraud and other crimes, now promotes an agenda of reforms, including voting rights for ex-felons. The libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch are donating money to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, to help insure that indigent defendants get competent legal representation, and they are co-sponsoring conferences on judicial reform with the American Civil Liberties Union.","2394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"In Congress and the states, conservatives and liberals have found common ground on such issues as cutting back mandatory-minimum sentences; using probation, treatment, and community service as alternatives to prison for low-level crimes; raising the age of juvenile-court jurisdictions; limiting solitary confinement; curtailing the practice of confiscating assets; rewriting the rules of probation and parole to avoid sending offenders back to jail on technicalities; restoring education and job training in prisons; allowing prisoners time off for rehabilitation; and easing the reëntry of those who have served time by expunging some criminal records and by lowering barriers to employment, education, and housing. As David Dagan and Steven M. Teles write, in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, “Retrenching the carceral state is becoming as orthodox on the Right as building it was just a few short years ago.” They conclude that this has created a “Nixon goes to China” opportunity to reverse decades of overkill.","2395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"This conservative transformation is often portrayed in the media as a novelty, and some progressives regard it as a ploy to cut taxes and turn prisons over to the private corrections industry. Yet it has deep roots and a tangle of motives, one of which is indeed a belief that downsizing prisons promises taxpayers some relief. (Locking up an inmate for a year can cost as much as tuition at a good college.) But for many conservatives, Nolan says, reducing spending is “ancillary.” “It’s human dignity that really motivates us.”","2396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"In September, I met Nolan in Washington, D.C., at a German deli downstairs from his office at the American Conservative Union Foundation, where he is the director of the new Center for Criminal Justice Reform. At sixty-five, he is tall and rotund, with a round, amiable face and a thatch of gray-white hair. Since 2011, he has suffered from restricted lung capacity, complicated by a lingering case of Lyme disease, and he uses a portable oxygen tank. But he still works full time, tracking the progress of reforms state by state, drafting op-eds for fellow-conservatives, planning conferences, rallying state legislators by phone, and firing off volleys on Twitter.","2397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"There are two main styles of Southern California Republicanism: the home-spun anecdotal optimism of Ronald Reagan and the uneasy conspiratorial resentment of Richard Nixon. Nolan is in the Reagan mold, upbeat and engaging even when he is describing what he regards as the transformative injustice of his life. He grew up on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles; his father was an accountant, and his mother, he said, “majored in raising kids”—nine of them. By the time he was old enough to have a paper route, the integrated middle-class neighborhood had turned rough. The family was devoutly Catholic, and Nolan remains so.","2398","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"At Notre Dame High School, he joined the Young Americans for Freedom—he and his friends liked to heckle Jane Fonda at anti-Vietnam War rallies, chanting, “Barbarella bombed, why can’t Nixon?”—and in 1966 he was a volunteer for Reagan’s first gubernatorial campaign. He tried three times to enlist in the Marine officer-training program, but each time he failed the physical, owing to a knee injury suffered when a car knocked him off his bike on his delivery route. After graduating from the University of Southern California and then its law school, he represented white-collar defendants in civil cases for a few years, served part time as a reserve deputy sheriff, and went into politics. By the time of Shrimpscam, he was widely viewed as a potential speaker of the assembly, even a plausible candidate for governor or for the Senate.","2399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“I went to the legislature very pro cop and with a get-tough-on-crime attitude,” Nolan told me. He wanted to reinstate the death penalty, which the Supreme Court had temporarily suspended. He believed that the exclusionary rule, which disallows evidence improperly obtained by the police, had become a loophole that lawyers exploited to allow guilty clients to go free. He excoriated a colleague in the assembly for proposing a law that would extend workers’ compensation to inmates injured in prison labor programs. And he was a leading sponsor of a prison-building boom in the state, which included, to his eventual regret, the Pelican Bay supermax facility, where inmates are kept in long-term solitary.","2400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The F.B.I. sting, he says, dispelled his unconditional faith in law enforcement. In Nolan’s telling of it, trophy-hunting agents browbeat his aides and his campaign supporters to build a case against him, leaking tidbits to the press in the hope of breaking his resolve. The prosecutor loaded the charge sheet so heavily that Nolan concluded that he couldn’t risk going before a jury. Like roughly ninety-five per cent of people convicted in America, he pleaded guilty and took a lesser sentence rather than take his chances at trial. He began to wonder how many of the people he had dismissed as bad guys had simply succumbed to prosecutorial bullying. He said, “I saw that the F.B.I. and the government prosecutors weren’t interested in the truth, and that was a shock to me.”","2401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"By the standards of American incarceration, Nolan had it easy. He served twenty-five months in two prisons that housed the least menacing felons. The Federal Prison Camp at Dublin, near San Francisco, was a compound of former Army barracks surrounded by landscaped flower gardens. There was a small coterie of white-collar criminals, but the majority of the inmates were blacks and Latinos serving time for relatively minor drug convictions. Nolan helped organize religious-study groups, and—to judge by his accounts in an unpublished memoir—he treated his fellow-inmates as a constituency to be charmed. (He still corresponds with some of them.) From prison, Nolan produced a chatty newsletter that his wife, Gail, distributed to some two thousand supporters. He had regular visits from his family and a loyal band of political friends. After ten months, he was transferred to Geiger Corrections Center, near Spokane, where the supervision was even less oppressive. Still, his time in prison exposed him to what he came to see as the cynical cycle of American justice: sweep up young men, mostly from broken families in underprivileged neighborhoods, put them away for a while, send them back onto the streets with no skills, and repeat. To call this a “corrections” system seemed a sour joke.","2402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“I had assumed they did all they could to help prepare the guys to return to society and make a better life,” Nolan told me. “But they were just warehousing them.” There was a pervasive sense of defeat. “The implication is: you’re worthless, you come from nothing, you are nothing, you’ll never be anything.” He added that when prisoners were released the guards would say, “See you in a few months.” He was surprised, too, at the number of elderly and infirm inmates. In his memoir, he wrote that “incarcerating people who aren’t a physical threat to society is expensive and counter-productive”—something that “only a nation that is rich and vindictive” would do.","2403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nolan was still an inmate when he ventured into the politics of reform. In 1994, in the California Political Review, he published an attack on that year’s crime bill—President Clinton’s signature contribution to mass incarceration, which earmarked $9.7 billion for prisons, imposed tougher sentences, and, among many punitive provisions, eliminated college grants for prison inmates. Many Republicans turned against the bill, because it also included a ban on assault rifles and funded remedial inner-city programs, such as “midnight basketball.” Nolan’s objections were different: he argued that the bill would bring profits to the prison industry but do little to reduce crime. He wrote, “Above all, conservatives should ask themselves how likely it is that these bloated bureaucracies . . . will turn out to be any less rapacious, irresponsible, or concerned with the rights of ordinary Americans than, say, the IRS, just because they are packaged and marketed under the dishonest label ‘tough on crime.’ ”","2404","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The following year, when Congress was reviewing the hundred-to-one disparity in the penalties for crack versus powder cocaine, Nolan used his phone privileges to urge Republican representatives to treat the two drugs equally. “The kid on the bunk above me was doing ten years for crack,” Nolan told me. “There’s essentially no difference” between the two forms of the drug, he said, “but so many blacks were doing absurdly long sentences for crack.” Nolan says that he helped line up support from thirty-four Republican members of the House, but lost half of them when Clinton’s Attorney General, Janet Reno, endorsed the harsher punishments. “How could they let Janet Reno get to their right on drug policy?” he asked.","2405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Unlike most parolees, Nolan had a job waiting for him. Charles Colson, a Nixon White House aide who had become a devout Evangelical Christian shortly before serving seven months in a federal prison for his part in the Watergate scandal, had organized the Prison Fellowship, a network of volunteers who visited inmates and promoted faith as a path back into society’s good graces. When the volunteers reported appalling conditions and a permeating sense of hopelessness in the prisons, Colson decided to launch a political offshoot, called the Justice Fellowship. The idea was to build a grassroots campaign to lobby Congress and state lawmakers for more humane treatment of inmates during and after incarceration, but Colson was so busy running the evangelical network that the effort languished. Colson had heard of Nolan through mutual Republican friends, who portrayed him as equally at ease talking about God and dealing with politicians. So in the spring of 1996, as Nolan was preparing to leave prison, Colson asked him to move to Washington and run the Justice Fellowship. Once there, Nolan realized that a grassroots network was already in place: fifty thousand Prison Fellowship volunteers and a couple of hundred thousand donors.","2406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Their first test came later that year, with a proposal moving through Congress that would have sharply limited the right of inmates to file lawsuits under the First Amendment. Many prosecutors favored the measure as a way to curb nuisance lawsuits, but Nolan argued that it would also inhibit legitimate religious freedom. “You’d get some inmate suing for steak dinners on the grounds that he belonged to the Church of Filet Mignon,” he said. “But you also had wardens who wouldn’t serve kosher meals to Orthodox Jews.” Crosses that Latino prisoners fashioned from plastic trash bags were banned in some prisons as “gang attire.” Nolan and Colson asked their network to contact their legislators and raise the issue at town-hall meetings. Nolan organized a press conference in which a Republican and a Democrat—Senators John Ashcroft and Edward Kennedy—defended the rights of inmates. The proposal died.","2407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Next, Nolan sought to enlist the fellowship in the campaign against prison rape. Studies showed that as many as one inmate in five was the victim of sexual assault, by another inmate or by prison staff. Such attacks, when inmates dared to report them, were dismissed as a hazard of incarceration. “Prison rape was a secular issue, but with moral overtones,” Nolan told me. The direct-mail firm that handled Colson’s fund-raising “didn’t want to touch the issue,” he said. “They thought, Oh, it makes people uncomfortable. It’ll turn people off.” But the volunteers agreed to rally conservative support, and, in conjunction with human-rights organizations and liberal groups, they helped secure the unanimous passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, in 2003. Nolan is the first to admit that the law hasn’t come close to eliminating the problem. But it did make the Justice Fellowship a force for reform beyond issues of strictly religious interest. Its members subsequently helped on the passage of the Second Chance Act, which provides federal grants to help released convicts reënter society, and the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the disparity—to eighteen to one—between sentences for crack and powder cocaine.","2408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"During those years, Nolan discovered a number of prominent right-wing figures who had come to support criminal-justice reform from various directions. Some, like David Keene, the former president of the National Rifle Association, whose son was sentenced to ten years for a road-rage shooting, were, like Colson and Nolan himself, influenced by personal experience. Grover Norquist, an activist famous for extracting no-new-taxes pledges from members of Congress, was attracted to the issue partly by the odor of wasted tax money, and became an early Nolan ally. Richard Viguerie, who refined direct-mail fund-raising in the service of the far right, also came to the campaign early, on moral grounds. (A substantial minority on the right, notably Catholics, have turned against capital punishment. Nolan and Viguerie are among them.) Edwin Meese, President Reagan’s Attorney General, for the most part a classic law-and-order conservative, faulted the system for failing to provide indigent defendants access to adequate legal counsel and opposed the reclassification of minor regulatory violations as felonies. (A favorite conservative talking point is that Texas has eleven felonies related to the harvesting of oysters.) Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a co-author of the 1994 Contract with America, with its unforgiving anticrime provisions, told me that he was persuaded to embrace reform because of the high recidivism rates. “It’s just stunningly stupid to have a system that keeps returning people to jail,” he told me.","2409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"After George W. Bush was reëlected, in 2004, and the Republican majorities in Congress were strengthened, Nolan attended a seminar in Richmond, Virginia, where conservatives debated what to do with their consolidated power. Norquist and Keene separately urged him to pull together the factions of conservatism on justice reform. So he began hosting occasional off-the-record lunches where you might have seen libertarians from the Cato Institute, advocates of judicial restraint from the Federalist Society, social conservatives from the Family Research Council, and hard-core fiscal conservatives like Norquist. Attendees found a unifying theme in the arrogance and the overreach of government and the toll that it took on individual freedom and responsibility. Nolan became, mostly behind the scenes, a trusted broker, strategist, theoretician, fund-raiser, diplomat, and whip. “If Pat says something, it’s kind of the final word,” Viguerie told me.","2410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"One place where conservative interests coalesced was the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a free-market think tank based in Austin, which helped convert then Governor Rick Perry from an indiscriminate law-and-order enthusiast to a self-styled apostle of pragmatic reform. In 2007, Perry joined reformers in the state legislature in a plan to cancel a major expansion of the state’s prisons and redirect some of the savings to addiction treatment for low-level drug offenders, as an alternative to incarceration. The prison population dropped sufficiently that Texas closed one facility in 2011 and two more in 2013.","2411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The feat was less impressive than it seemed. When Perry became governor, in 2000, he inherited the largest and fastest-growing prison population in the country, the legacy of a prison-building program under his predecessors Ann Richards and George W. Bush. The state could easily afford to release hundreds of minor offenders without risking a spike in crime. Still, Perry’s example was one that Nolan and others could hold out to politicians who worried about being pilloried as soft on crime. Vikrant Reddy, a former Texas Public Policy Foundation lawyer who is now a criminal-justice fellow at a think tank backed by Charles Koch, said, “This is the ultimate hang-’em-high state. If you say you’ve done these impressive things on prison reform in Vermont, nobody’s really listening. If you say they did it in Texas, then you have a captive audience.”","2412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The next step was to replicate the Texas story in other states. Marc Levin, a conservative lawyer who headed the Texas foundation’s justice-reform operation, came up with a catchy name—Right on Crime—for a new advocacy group set up out of the foundation in 2010 to share policy ideas and mobilize prominent conservatives for reform. Levin and Nolan realized that, instead of building a new coalition of name-brand conservatives for each battle, they could get supporters to sign on to a statement of principles—transparency and accountability, individual liberty, cost-effectiveness, a chance for rehabilitation, limited government, a voice for crime victims, a preference for solutions based on family and community. That way, the signatories’ names could be invoked without having to ask for permission every time.","2413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“Sort of like Henry Ford inventing the assembly line, it allowed us to handle a large number of issues,” Nolan said. Variations on the Texas approach to reducing the prison population have since been adopted in Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky, and Mississippi. “You now have all these conservative and liberal governors touching what used to be a third rail,” said John Malcolm, a former prosecutor who oversees the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, at the Heritage Foundation. Last year in California, Right on Crime, with financing from B. Wayne Hughes, Jr., the son of a storage-locker billionaire, and with Nolan working the phones to legislators in his home state, provided support for Proposition 47, which downgraded minor drug and property crimes to misdemeanors. It passed in November.","2414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Although right and left generally agree on the scale of the problem, they diverge on the question of its causes. The view of many on the left is distilled to its essence by the legal scholar Michelle Alexander in her best-selling 2010 book, “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness.” Alexander posited that the criminal-justice system as it exists today is the product of the country’s economic and racial history.","2415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The fact that nearly a third of black men in this country are destined to spend time in jail or prison, Alexander argued, cannot be explained as simply a society defending itself against urban predators. In her view, Nixon’s tough-on-crime agenda and Reagan’s escalation of the war on drugs were aimed, consciously or not, at halting the advances of the civil-rights movement and perpetuating the neglect of the underclass. While race has influenced the administration of justice in this country from its beginning, she says, since the nineteen-eighties mass incarceration has decimated minority neighborhoods to the extent that it has become a malign form of containment. “It is no longer concerned primarily with the prevention and punishment of crime, but rather with the management and control of the dispossessed,” she wrote. On many days, the news seems to provide evidence for Alexander’s case: racial profiling; stop-and-frisk; the targeted prosecution of drug laws in black and brown communities; the disproportionate arrest, remand, and sentencing of minorities; the xenophobic alarm about immigration; and the quick resort to force by police and corrections officers against citizens of color.","2416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Alexander told me that during the five years that she has been travelling around the country talking about her book she has often found conservatives “more advanced in their thinking” than liberal politicians, who, after many years of having to play tough for voters, “have become comfortable with the criminal-justice system as it is.” Religious conservatives in particular, she said, “really appreciate the moral and spiritual dimensions of mass incarceration.”","2417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"As a theory of how we got to this point, Alexander’s view supplies a powerful logic but is of little comfort to advocates of piecemeal reforms, which she regards as “utterly insufficient.” She told me, “Some people who might have spent more than a decade behind bars may spend only a few years. Children who might not otherwise have ever known their parents may have a shot at having relationships with their mother or father, and people may receive additional support—job training or education.” However, she added, “I’m deeply concerned that many people will mistake these reforms for the kind of cultural and institutional transformation that is necessary.” The current bipartisan ferment might improve a few lives, she conceded, but repairing criminal justice requires “a radical restructuring of our society,” potentially driven by “third parties and new political formations” rather than by Republicans or Democrats. She told me, “I’m not enlisting the very people who constructed the system to take charge of now reforming it.”","2418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“Michelle Alexander has gotten a lot of publicity, and a lot of people have been attracted by it,” Nolan said. “But I think it’s counterproductive to go and start off by punching people in the face, saying, ‘You’re part of the white slave-master mentality that has done this.’ ” On the right, the excesses of the system are most often explained as the result of too much government coddling and a breakdown of families, resulting in a surge of crime and a corresponding rise in public alarm. The war on drugs and the ensuing explosion of the prison population, many conservatives argue, were not acts of racism but responses to legitimate fears. But Nolan says, “Our rhetoric helped grow the climate in which the government could overreach. Prison became the default choice when it should be the last resort. I guess I’m somewhat defensive, because a lot of liberals say that this is a way of making up for the wrong things we did. I think that both hands were on the knife.”","2419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nixon and Reagan—and the 1988 campaign of George H. W. Bush, with the infamous Willie Horton TV ad—tapped a vein of white anxiety, but liberals were co-architects of the current situation. The “war on drugs” had no more outspoken champion than the liberal Massachusetts Democrat and House Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill, Jr. Reacting to the death from a crack overdose of Len Bias, a promising Boston Celtics recruit, O’Neill helped push through the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which imposed mandatory sentences, asset forfeitures, and the severe sanctions on crack. The 1994 crime bill was introduced by a Delaware liberal, Joe Biden, and championed by Bill Clinton. (In this Presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton can expect to be attacked for her husband’s tough-on-crime expedience—from the right.)","2420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The year that Clinton signed that bill, thirty-seven per cent of Americans identified crime as the nation’s most important problem. By 2012, the number was two per cent. The crime rate has plateaued at its lowest level in decades, a development variously attributed to the ebbing of the crack epidemic, an improved economy, smarter policing, the aging of the baby boomers, and, at huge expense, mass incarceration. A new generation has come of age in safer cities, and now Democratic officials who dared not endorse less punitive approaches to crime have conservatives to give them political cover. “What I tell conservatives is liberals cannot lead on reforming the criminal-justice system,” Viguerie told me. “And so, if conservatives don’t lead, nothing happens.”","2421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"There is a tendency, on both sides, to make ending mass incarceration seem easier than it is. In March, I went to Washington for the Bipartisan Summit on Criminal Justice Reform, hosted by the liberal activist Van Jones, the Democratic consultant Donna Brazile, Gingrich, and Nolan, and attended by several hundred reform enthusiasts. Jones called it “the Woodstock of criminal justice.” The only discordant note I heard came from Senator Cory Booker, the New Jersey Democrat who campaigned as a criminal-justice reformer. One of the sponsors of the summit—a roster that included Koch Industries and the A.C.L.U.—was #cut50, a bipartisan organization that advocates halving the prison population over the next ten years. (Nolan is listed as a partner on the group’s Web site, although he says that thirty per cent is a more realistic goal.) To accomplish such a drastic cut, Booker suggested, would entail releasing not only pot smokers and shoplifters but also people guilty of more serious crimes. He invited the audience to talk about reëxamining some offenses now categorized as violent. Nobody seemed inclined to take him up on the offer.","2422","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"There are whole areas of policy where bipartisan consensus remains far out of reach. Guns, for starters, are untouchable. (Norquist likes to provoke liberals with the creative theory that the crime rate has fallen because more Americans have concealed-carry permits.) For most Republicans, outright legalization of drugs, even marijuana, “is one we can’t touch,” Nolan says. The idea of restoring voting rights to ex-felons, which has the support of Rand Paul and Nolan as well as Bernie Kerik, appeals to many Democrats but terrifies most Republicans. “They have this image of hordes of criminals” flocking to the polls to vote for Democrats, Nolan said. Conservatives tend to look more favorably on privatizing prisons, prison services, and probation, a scheme that liberals view with deep distrust. The death penalty, which divides the right, is not on the shared agenda.","2423","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"The most significant question is whether conservatives are prepared to face the cost of the remedies, from in-prison education and job training to more robust probationary supervision and drug and mental-health treatment. Joan Petersilia, a criminologist who teaches at the Stanford Law School, points to the last great American exercise in decarceration, half a century ago: President Kennedy’s Community Mental Health Act, which aimed to reduce by half the number of patients in state mental hospitals. The promised alternatives—hundreds of community care facilities—were never fully funded, and thousands of deeply troubled people were liberated into homelessness. The mentally ill now make up a substantial portion of inmates in state prisons and county jails.","2424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“The direction forward is not really clear, because, on the one hand, the right is saying less government, less spending,” Petersilia told me. “And the left is saying we need more investment.” She offers the example of California, which for nearly five years has been under a Supreme Court order to cull the overcrowded prisons that Nolan once helped build. “The success story of downsizing prisons in California is like nothing the nation has ever experienced,” she said. “We have downsized in less than five years twenty-five per cent of all prison populations. But look what is happening at the local, community level, which is that they’ve upsized jails, and they’ve got a homeless population, they’ve got police officers complaining about the mentally ill. We didn’t answer the question: if not prisons, what?”","2425","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nolan agrees about the cost of alternatives: “In each of the Right on Crime states, we have insisted that a large part of the savings be put back into the system.” As for his home state, Nolan says, “we were not a part of that mess.” Nolan thinks that Governor Jerry Brown failed to plan adequate prison alternatives because “he just wanted to get the court off his back.” When conservatives did venture into California, last November, to help pass Proposition 47, the measure required that two-thirds of any money saved be funnelled into alternative correctional programs. Nolan said, “Conservatives have insisted that money be plowed into services because we know that just releasing prisoners or diverting them from prisons without services would increase crime.” That is true, but it tends to be relegated to the fine print in conservative reform literature. The headlines promise tremendous savings to taxpayers.","2426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Nolan has another worry: that one sensational crime, or a spike in the crime rate, or the distraction of more polarizing issues could send Republicans and Democrats back to their corners. “We’ve all said we’re one bad incident away from having this erode on us,” he said. But if the bipartisan movement can accomplish the things it agrees on, Nolan has a wish list of additional reforms that he will pitch to conservatives. He would like to see abusive prosecutors lose their licenses. He would require the police to videotape interrogations from beginning to end, not just a confession that may have been improperly extracted.","2427","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"And, mindful of the prisoners who have been exonerated while waiting on death row, he would like to end capital punishment. In the last week of May, Nolan was urging Republican state senators in Nebraska to repeal that state’s death penalty, over the governor’s veto. The repeal prevailed without a vote to spare, making Nebraska the first conservative state in four decades to do away with the death penalty. Nolan was jubilant.","2428","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"“I think the Nebraska vote is a pivot point,” he e-mailed me. “You can’t get more red than Nebraska, and the cooperation of flinty conservatives and urban blacks was unstoppable. I think they really enjoyed working together and finding common ground. That is the experience that I have had as well.” In his sign-off, he turned to Scripture: “The lamb and the lion shall lie down together.” ♦","2429","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/prison-revolt"
"Olga Flores, the seventh of eleven siblings, was born in a small town in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo thirty-nine years ago. “There was no work,” she told me recently. “The only thing for a woman to do was to get married, have children, and cook for her whole life.” A job in a nearby city would have required a high-school certificate, but her education ended in middle school. So in January of 1998, when she was twenty-one, Flores arranged to come to the United States illegally. She took her first trip on an airplane, to northern Mexico, and made her way to Sonoyta, a town on the Arizona border.","2430","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"One of her brothers had immigrated to Columbus, Ohio, a few years earlier, and he helped her make arrangements to cross into the U.S. “There were about a dozen of us,” she recalled. “It was a small truck, with the seats taken out. They told us to lie down in the back, head to feet, feet to head, so there would be room for everyone.” They drove for about three hours, stopped at a mobile home in the desert, then continued on to Phoenix. A friend had set up another ride, which would take them across the country, to Ohio. “It was so cold, and I didn’t have a jacket,” Flores said. “We slept in the car and ate at McDonald’s. It was the first burger I ever had. It was very tasty.” When she reached Columbus, she paid her brother a thousand dollars, which he turned over to the guides, or coyotes, who had made the trip possible.","2431","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Eventually, Flores got a job as a cashier at a Wendy’s. “It was really hard for me, because I couldn’t tell what the Americans wanted,” she said. “When I learned more English, I started taking orders.” She soon met David Flores, who was also in the United States illegally. They got married and had twin boys, David and Luis, in 2000, and a third son, Iker, four years ago. “David has always been a really good person and a really good father,” Flores said. “In Mexico, we are used to men not washing dishes and not doing anything around the house, and he is the opposite.” Today, David operates a taco truck, which he stations in a parking lot near the small duplex apartment where the family lives, just outside Columbus. David is in the truck from 11 A.M. to 9 P.M. on weekdays, and on Sundays he works at McDonald’s. When Olga is not caring for the children, she is in her kitchen, preparing the rice, intestines, and tongue for the truck.","2432","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Like many people who have arrived illegally from Mexico, Flores has built a productive life here. She is a longtime resident, has no criminal record, and is the parent of American citizens. Through much of Barack Obama’s Presidency, there was a political near-consensus regarding the need to address the status of immigrants like Flores. Under the immigration-reform law passed by the Senate in 2013, she would have had a path to become a citizen; under the executive actions announced by President Obama in 2014, she could have obtained work papers and a driver’s license. But the House failed to vote on the Senate’s immigration bill, and a federal court in Texas has placed Obama’s initiative on hold.","2433","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The result is a comprehensive breakdown in public policy. During the Obama Administration, which purports to be dedicated to easing the plight of residents like her, Flores and her peers have faced greater threats of deportation than at any time in decades. Republicans, for their part, have ended their brief experiment, reflected in the Senate bill, in bipartisanship on immigration. The Party is now close to united in opposition to any initiative that might offer Flores and others the chance to become American citizens. Flores, and the roughly eleven million people in similar situations, have no choice but to wait and worry.","2434","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Donald Trump, in his speech announcing his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination, in June, addressed the issue of illegal immigration from Mexico. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” (The crime rate among first-generation immigrants is significantly lower than that of the general population, according to Bianca Bersani, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.) Trump’s remarks prompted several of his business partners, including Univision and Macy’s, to sever their ties with him, but the comments have led to relatively little examination of the lives of the immigrants themselves.","2435","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"For many years, Flores’s legal status existed for her as a kind of background anxiety, affecting her life in modest ways. Because traffic stops by the police could lead to deportation, she drove the family car as little as possible, and never out of state. “Here, at least, we know the city, we know the streets, we know which are one-way or two-way,” she said. “If we go somewhere else, we are scared that we don’t know the area.” Now her situation has taken on a new urgency. Early this year, her son Iker had a series of infections that proved resistant to treatment. “The first two times that I took him to the doctor, they said it was an ear infection and then a throat infection, and they did not draw blood. On the fourteenth of February, we noticed that he had some red dots on his ears. That’s when they drew blood. Four days later, they told me he had cancer of the blood”—acute lymphocytic leukemia. Iker has begun a course of chemotherapy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, in Columbus, which is likely to take three or four years.","2436","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“Before I had children, I thought about what if the police would pick me up—I would just leave, go back to Mexico, even though I haven’t been there in a long time,” Flores told me. “Now that my child is sick, I really do worry. Medicine back home is very different. When you go to the doctor, you have to take money before things happen. He has a higher probability of surviving in the United States. Now we have to stay.”","2437","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"When I visited the Floreses’ apartment, Olga demonstrated a trick with sour cream that she had learned during a stint working at Chipotle. She emptied a five-pound jar into a metal bowl, then whipped it with a wooden spoon. “If you whip it first, it comes out of the squirt bottles easier,” she said. The family’s duplex is in a town-house development. There are two refrigerators squeezed into the kitchen, to accommodate the restaurant-size quantities of food that the family must buy and prepare every week for the taco truck. Iker sat on the sofa watching cartoons on a big-screen television. He’s an outgoing kid, who moves seamlessly between English and Spanish, but he has been having a tough time with the chemotherapy. He’s weak and very thin, and has trouble keeping food down. Lately, he has been struggling to walk up the stairs to his bedroom, so Olga is carrying him around more than she once did. His brothers help out, but at this moment they were at the truck, helping their father.","2438","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Shortly after Iker’s cancer was diagnosed, Flores went to see Julie Nemecek, an immigration lawyer in Columbus, to ask about her options for establishing a more secure basis for remaining in the United States. Nemecek had handled many similar cases before. “Most of the people I hear from have been in Ohio for a long time, and the vast majority are undocumented, because they snuck across the border,” she said. “They have made lives here. They have been in hiding, hoping that when they drive to work or take their kids to school they won’t get stopped.” Nemecek offers clients like Flores little reassurance. “Everything is in limbo, so people are uncertain, and they feel hopeless,” she said.","2439","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"When Barack Obama ran for the Presidency, he pledged to enact comprehensive immigration reform, but he didn’t push the issue in his first two years in office, when Democrats had strong majorities in both houses of Congress. Instead, he made what became known as a “down payment” for a bipartisan immigration bill later in his Presidency.","2440","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“There was definitely in the Obama Administration an intention to do tough enforcement as a down payment for comprehensive immigration reform later,” Marc Rosenblum, of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said. Rosenblum is the deputy director of the institute’s U.S.-immigration-policy program. “The idea was to prove to Republicans that he could be trusted on enforcement, so that he could get a path to citizenship in return.”","2441","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The first part of the down payment was to toughen enforcement at the Mexican border. Under Obama, a record number of agents are patrolling the border: nearly twenty thousand, roughly five times as many as there were two decades ago. In the light of this change, the Obama Administration has claimed that the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border has reached a forty-year low. (The faltering economy during Obama’s first term, which made the United States a less promising destination, was certainly another important factor in the decline.)","2442","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The more controversial part of Obama’s down payment involved immigrants who had already arrived and settled in the United States. The Administration greatly expanded a program known as Secure Communities, in which information was shared between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the F.B.I. Whenever anyone was arrested and booked, his or her fingerprints would be sent to the F.B.I., as before, but now the information would also go to the immigration authorities. “It was a huge force multiplier,” Rosenblum said. “The program was pitched as a tool to find serious criminals, but, at least initially, the vast majority of people were picked up for traffic violations and very minor offenses. A lot of these people ended up being deported.” Julie Nemecek recalled, “Around 2010, the number of my Mexican clients increased, with enforcement getting really, really heavy because of Secure Communities. People were getting picked up left and right when their only offense was driving without a license or drunk driving.” As a result of tougher enforcement, deportations soared under Obama. Since 2009, removals of illegal immigrants have averaged more than four hundred thousand per year, compared with an average of two hundred and fifty thousand per year under George W. Bush.","2443","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Secure Communities had an enormous impact on the day-to-day lives of Latinos in the United States. “There are people who are not a safety threat who are snared into the deportation apparatus,” Clarissa Martínez, the deputy vice-president of the National Council of La Raza, a leading Hispanic-rights organization, told me. “Also, when you start deputizing local law enforcement to help apply immigration law, you are going to have abuses, and that’s what happened. People feel that regardless of whether you are first-, second-, third-generation American, the folks who are going to be stopped are going to be Latinos.” Rosenblum said, “Until the last decade or so, the chances were, if you made it past the border, you were not going to get deported, unless you were committing serious crimes. But, with the crackdown, the broader immigrant community felt under attack. They lived here, and suddenly they were unable to work, unable to drive.”","2444","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Still, the underlying theory was that Secure Communities would be the stick, and comprehensive immigration reform would be the carrot—and the goal appeared within reach after Obama was reëlected, in 2012. The defeat of Mitt Romney brought Republicans to the realization that they had to broaden their appeal to Hispanics, the fastest-growing group of potential voters in the nation. In March of 2013, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, released a report that said the Party “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” In short order, many Republicans in the Senate, including such prominent figures as John McCain and Marco Rubio, did just that, and a bill that included a path to citizenship for people like Olga Flores passed by a vote of sixty-eight to thirty-two.","2445","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The battle over immigration reform presents a clash of fundamentally different visions of the role of the federal government. The President and his allies assert that their position is based on a combination of realism and compassion. They argue that it’s impossible to deport all of the country’s illegal immigrants. In addition, they say, it’s heartless to break up families who are long settled in the United States.","2446","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Opponents of reform, who are led by Jeff Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama, believe that national security, along with the rule of law, compels a different approach. “If everyone who enters the country illegally can stay and become a citizen, that just encourages more people to come illegally,” Sessions told me. “If people see that they have nothing to fear after they cross the border and settle here, then that creates an incentive for more people to come, and that’s wrong. If they are here illegally, they should be deported.” What’s more, he argues, a porous border invites criminals, including terrorists, to settle in the promised land of the United States.","2447","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Yet John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, and Eric Cantor, the Majority Leader, described themselves as supporters of immigration reform, and it was clear after the 2012 election that the votes were there to pass it. “Boehner promised the President that he was going to bring a bill to the floor,” a former White House aide told me. “There’s always a significant House-versus-Senate rivalry, so the Senate bill itself was going to be a nonstarter in the House. But some sort of reform bill was sure to pass if it came to a vote.” Virtually all of the Democrats in the House, as well as some Republicans, supported comprehensive reform along the lines of the Senate bill, but immigration reform was anathema to the Tea Party. Boehner asked staff from the House leadership to come up with a proposal that modified the Senate bill without gutting it. The result was an outline of recommendations, but conservatives in the House persuaded Boehner to back away from them.","2448","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"After the passage of the Senate bill, chances for any sort of reform bill in the House began to recede. The government shutdown, for two weeks in October of 2013, poisoned relations between the President and congressional Republicans. Then, on June 10, 2014, Cantor lost a primary to a poorly funded and largely unknown challenger, who focussed his campaign on Cantor’s alleged softness on illegal immigration. The victor, David Brat, went on to win the seat. Republican support for reform suddenly vanished. As the former White House aide told me, “There was always this germ of hope, but then Eric Cantor lost his primary. There was probably a five-per-cent chance before that, and it went to zero.”","2449","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Olga Flores speaks English imperfectly, so some of our conversations were interpreted by Jessica Pantaleon Camacho, who works as an assistant in Julie Nemecek’s law office. Pantaleon Camacho was born in Mexico twenty years ago and brought to the U.S. illegally as a three-year-old. “When I started going to high school, I convinced myself that school was the only way I could get my family out of the situation,” she told me. “I took all Advanced Placement classes starting in my sophomore year. I graduated near the top of my class.” Her teachers wrote enthusiastic recommendations to colleges, and Pantaleon Camacho was accepted at several schools, with scholarship offers. “When I was about to graduate, we had to decide what school,” she said. “That’s when they told me that I needed a Social Security number. I wasn’t able to provide it.”","2450","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Pantaleon Camacho is among the “Dreamers,” the term that has come to define the group of people who were brought illegally to the United States when they were children. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, known as the DREAM Act, was presented several years ago as a modest alternative to the round of comprehensive immigration reform that was stalled in Congress at the time. The law would provide a path to citizenship for people like Pantaleon Camacho, who had essentially lived their entire lives as Americans. It failed, and the President began taking a series of unilateral executive actions designed to ease the plight of the Dreamers. On June 15, 2012, the Obama Administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program would give as many as 1.7 million people work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation, which was renewable for another two years. In most cases, this meant that the Dreamers were also eligible for driver’s licenses and, in some states, for in-state tuition at state universities. Almost eight hundred thousand individuals applied for DACA coverage, and about eighty-four per cent of them were approved.","2451","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Pantaleon Camacho was one of them. “It has changed my life,” she told me. “I have a Social Security number and a driver’s license. I am able to drive without fear of being pulled over and being sent back to Mexico.” Her job in the lawyer’s office is on the books. She was admitted to Bowling Green, a state university in Ohio, but she is ineligible for any scholarship assistance, so she takes classes at a local community college. “It all comes out of my own pocket,” Pantaleon Camacho told me. Her situation is much improved but still tenuous: her DACA status expires roughly at the end of the Obama Administration, and no one knows what the next President will do with the program.","2452","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"DACA did nothing to help families like the Floreses, in which the parents came to the U.S. as adults and the children were born here. By 2014, immigration activists began putting greater pressure on Obama to take executive action to help more families. “When Boehner pulled out of the process, that’s when there was a total focus on the President, because the legislative door had been shut,” Clarissa Martínez, of La Raza, said. The White House felt the heat. “There was a period in 2014 when the immigration activists gave up on Congress and said it’s now on the President,” the former White House aide said. “They started calling him Deporter-in-Chief. The President brought them all in. He said by criticizing him they were letting the Republicans off the hook. He said he needed more time. He said, ‘I will do everything I can at the end of the summer.’ ” But Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races, like Kay Hagan, in North Carolina, implored the White House not to take any controversial steps on immigration before the midterm elections. Obama agreed; activists seethed; virtually all the Democratic candidates, including Hagan, lost anyway.","2453","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Finally, on November 20, 2014, just a few weeks after the elections, Obama launched his long-awaited series of executive actions on immigration. As the President explained in a rare prime-time address from the White House, the centerpiece was an initiative called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, known as DAPA. This program, which would be run by the Department of Homeland Security, was aimed at the parents of American citizens who were themselves illegally in the country but had been law-abiding residents of the United States since 2010. Following a case-by-case review, they would receive an immigration status known as “deferred action,” enabling them to apply for work permits and driver’s licenses. DAPA was intended to cover about 3.6 million people, more than thirty per cent of the illegal immigrants in the United States. The D.H.S. made plans to hire as many as three thousand new employees, some of whom would work in Arlington, Virginia, in an eleven-story building that the government leased for $7.8 million a year. (Also on November 20th, Obama expanded eligibility for the DACA program, and replaced Secure Communities with a program that targets serious criminals.) According to Obama’s plan, the government would begin accepting applications for deferred action under DAPA in February, 2015.","2454","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"“DAPA is of tremendous magnitude,” Clarissa Martínez said. “It’s what Americans want of the undocumented community—that they come forward, go through criminal-background checks, and those who are working do so legally. For the American public, it sounds practical and pragmatic to give people who have deep roots in the community and have good moral character a chance to get right with the law. The announcement of these programs was an incredible step forward and the biggest progress we’ve seen on the issue in two decades.”","2455","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The Floreses pride themselves on using fresh, authentic ingredients for their food truck. Olga showed off a large maguey leaf, from a variety of agave, which David was about to cut up, toast, and use as a seasoning for the meat before he grilled it. “The best things,” Olga said.","2456","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Olga Flores has not closely followed the twists and turns in immigration policy, but, like most immigrants, she was aware of DAPA and planned to take advantage of it. There is a cruel asymmetry to immigration law: the people with the most at stake have the most trouble understanding it. This is because, even for lawyers, immigration law is notoriously complicated. It’s related to, but ultimately very different from, other criminal or civil litigation; immigration law has its own traditions and doctrines—and the rules often change. For civilians, the morass is difficult to navigate, and for non-English-speaking immigrants the law can be nearly impenetrable. Still, everyone knew that Obama’s November 20th directives were hugely significant. On the night of Obama’s speech, many immigration-rights groups around the country held viewing parties to celebrate the news. Flores was hopeful, too. “We were very excited,” she told me.","2457","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"But two weeks after Obama’s announcement Texas and sixteen other states sued the federal government to stop the DAPA program. Eight states joined later. The heart of the case against the Administration is the contention that Obama overstepped his authority in establishing the program. “The case isn’t about any particular immigration policy; it’s about the rule of law,” Scott Keller, the Texas solicitor general, told me. “DAPA rewrites the immigration statutes, and the executive does not have unilateral authority to do that. Congress has not granted the executive the power to deem people who are unlawfully in the country to be eligible for work permits, Medicare, unemployment benefits, and access to international travel. Congress has done quite the opposite. The executive can’t do it alone.”","2458","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Obama Administration lawyers fired back from several directions. First, they argued that Texas and the other states lacked standing—that is, that they had no right to file the case in the first place, because DAPA imposed no obligations on the states. “The core of Texas’s argument is that they will have to pay for driver’s licenses for the beneficiaries of DAPA,” an Administration official told me. “But that’s not enough to get them standing. It’s a very incidental expense, and they could raise their prices to cover it, anyway. States don’t get to sue just because they don’t like the policies of the federal government, and that’s what this case is really about.” The plaintiffs have argued that they have standing because DAPA will encourage illegal immigration, which would be an imposition on states. Yet fourteen states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of DAPA, asserting that the program would actually help, not burden, individual states. “When immigrants are able to work legally—even for a limited time—their wages increase, they seek work compatible with their skill level, and they enhance their skills to obtain higher wages, all of which benefits State economies by increasing income and growing the tax base,” the brief explains.","2459","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"On the merits, too, Administration lawyers argued that the President was within his rights to extend these benefits to undocumented people. “This whole case is a matter of enforcement priorities,” the official said. “We can deport four hundred thousand people a year, but we can’t deport all eleven million undocumented people here, so the President has a right to establish his priorities for the limited time he is in office. And he’s saying that he is not going to deport people with children and ties to the community who are willing to undergo a background check.” George H. W. Bush had a similar program for a select group of immigrants, and it proceeded with little fanfare and no legal challenge.","2460","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Like the plaintiffs in many civil cases, the Texas solicitor general had wide latitude in choosing the court where he wanted to file the suit. Lawyers often do some judge-shopping if they think it will help them win their cases, and it was quickly evident that the Texas lawyers shopped wisely. Keller’s predecessor brought the lawsuit in Brownsville, close to the Mexican border. The local federal judge assigned to the case, Andrew Hanen, had already shown a marked hostility toward President Obama’s immigration policies. Hanen had been appointed to the district court in 2002 by George W. Bush, and, in earlier rulings, he had called the President’s deportation policy “misguided” and asserted that it “endangers America.”","2461","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"According to the President’s plan, the government was going to begin accepting applications for deferred action under DAPA on February 18th. Less than forty-eight hours before the program went into effect, Judge Hanen filed a hundred-and-twenty-three-page opinion issuing a preliminary injunction that put DAPA on hold. In the case known as Texas v. United States, he ruled that Texas and the other states did have standing to challenge the law, and then he ruled against the Administration on an esoteric but important matter. Hanen held that the Administration had failed to follow the correct procedures in putting DAPA into effect; he said that the Department of Homeland Security should have given the public the chance to be heard in what’s known as notice-and-comment rule-making before implementing the new policy. The opinion did not directly address the underlying legality of DAPA, but the judge offered clear hints that he was dubious about the program. DAPA “does not represent mere inadequacy; it is complete abdication,” Hanen wrote. “The D.H.S. does have discretion in the manner in which it chooses to fulfill the expressed will of Congress. It cannot, however, enact a program whereby it not only ignores the dictates of Congress, but actively acts to thwart them.”","2462","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"In a further rebuff to the Administration, Judge Hanen issued a stay on DAPA covering the entire country, even though his jurisdiction covered only part of Texas. Administration lawyers rushed an appeal of Hanen’s stay to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit—one of the most conservative circuits in the country. On May 26th, a panel of the appeals court ruled, two judges to one, that Hanen was correct to enjoin DAPA. Earlier this month, during a hearing before another three-judge panel, the same two judges maintained their skepticism about Obama’s immigration initiative. Regardless of what the Fifth Circuit ultimately rules, the losing party will still have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. As Jeff Sessions, Obama’s chief adversary in Congress, put it, “The courts may take longer than the President will be in office.” The Department of Homeland Security has put the plan to hire three thousand people to administer DAPA on indefinite hold.","2463","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"It’s always been a key part of the Administration’s plan to establish DAPA before the end of Obama’s term, making it difficult for any successor to withdraw a benefit that has already been granted. But by delaying his actions until after the 2014 midterms the President may have given his opponents, in Congress and in the courts, the time and the tools to unravel his most important work on immigration.","2464","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The oncology and hematology clinic of Nationwide Children’s Hospital is a determinedly sunny place. The furniture in the waiting room is colorful, the pictures on the walls cheerful. Entertainment options for the young patients abound. Iker Flores perched himself on an examination table and quickly lost himself in a video game. His prognosis is good; his cancer has a very high survival rate. Iker has become used to the chemo port affixed to his chest. But the treatment sessions, which last as long as twelve hours at a time, are gruelling. This visit was to check his blood to see if he was ready for a chemo session the next day. The doctors decided to put off treatment for a little while to allow Iker to regain some strength.","2465","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"The strain on the family, financial and otherwise, is considerable. The Flores children have health insurance through a nonprofit company in Ohio called CareSource, and the hospital has not pressed them for additional payments. But Olga had to give up part-time work cleaning houses to take care of Iker. He had been attending a Head Start program when he became sick, but he’s had to drop out. “The timing for DAPA was perfect for us,” Olga told me. “Even a few days before he was diagnosed, he was going to school nine to two.

"At one point, immigration represented a kind of exception to the polarization that dominates contemporary politics in Washington. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama pushed Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. And the Senate passed its bipartisan immigration bill only two years ago. But, as the Presidential campaign has heated up, the issue has come to split the parties in stark ways. “The experience under Obama and Bush has upped the ante on what we want to hear from candidates that are vying for the Presidency in 2016,” Clarissa Martínez said. “Both Obama and Bush said they wanted to get it done, and their hearts may have been in the right place, but they both ran into trouble with Congress. That’s why hearing that somebody believes in immigration reform is not good enough. We want to know what they will do on their own as President.”","2467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Trump’s comments about immigrants from Mexico drew condemnation from many Republicans for his impolitic tone, but, in their substance, his views are widely shared within the Party. At various times, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, and Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor, all supported versions of immigration reform that would allow people like Olga Flores to become citizens. All have tacked right. Bush has talked recently of a path to “legalized status” for undocumented aliens rather than a path to citizenship; he also said recently that he would repeal DACA and DAPA. Rubio has said that he now favors a piecemeal approach to immigration, rather than a comprehensive bill; and Walker recently said, “I don’t believe in amnesty” for those who have entered the country illegally. Rubio and Walker have also denounced DACA and DAPA. The other Republican candidates have talked about immigration almost exclusively in terms of border enforcement. Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, recently asked a group of supporters to “imagine a President that finally, finally, finally secures the borders,” and he criticized Obama’s “lawlessness and the President’s unconstitutional executive amnesty.”","2468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"Hillary Clinton, in contrast, has staked out a position to the left of President Obama. In an appearance in Las Vegas, in May, Clinton said, “We can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship.” She said it was “beyond absurd” to think that all eleven million illegal immigrants in the country could be deported. And she said that she would expand DACA and DAPA. “If Congress continues to refuse to act, as President I would do everything possible under the law to go even further,” she said, suggesting, for example, that she would extend protection to the parents of Dreamers.","2469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"For now, though, the only certainty for Olga Flores and others in similar situations is more uncertainty. If Clinton wins, and Congress remains in Republican hands, the new President will be reduced to attempting the same kind of piecemeal executive actions as Obama—if the courts even allow those to proceed. If a Republican wins, Flores’s chances of deportation will rise. Either way, the issue will remain on the national agenda, even as the opportunity to come to any solution continues to recede. ♦","2470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/american-limbo"
"On Monday night, the brief, frantic skirmish between Donald J. Trump and other forces in the Republican Party seemed to have stalled. The weekend had started so well for those in the G.O.P. who thought that their cohorts’ Trump fever might break; on Friday evening, he had besmirched Megyn Kelly, of Fox News—their own Megyn Kelly—in terms that seemed disqualifying. Trump appeared, in short, to have said that a woman they admired was having her period when she was asking hard questions as the moderator of the G.O.P. candidates’ first debate. And who, even among those who took pleasure in Trump’s disparagement of Mexicans (and other immigrants), John McCain (and other prisoners of war), and Rosie O’Donnell (and women generally), wanted to think about something like that? And yet, two days later, it was Trump who, catching his breath from calling his critics “deviants” and “sick,” was tweeting that Kelly’s boss, Roger Ailes, had called him to negotiate a peace. “He is a great guy & assures me that ‘Trump’ will be treated fairly on @FoxNews. His word is always good!”","August 11, 2015","2471","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"A few hours later, Ailes put out a statement confirming the accord, and Kelly, of whom Trump had also said, “She’s zippo … I have no respect for her,” told Fox viewers that it was “time to move forward.” By then, Reuters/Ipsos had released a new, post-debate poll; it found Trump still, somehow, in the lead among Republicans, with twenty-four per cent. Jeb Bush came in second, with twelve per cent. It was a small poll, with a margin of error of more than six per cent, but it was another indication that the debate and the Donald, rather than helping to narrow the field, have left it even more wide open than it was before. And Trump is still crashing through it.","2472","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"Why did the other Republicans think that Trump would crumple in shame? He never has before. It is a measure of the 2016 Presidential race that the strongest point Trump raised in his defense over the weekend—he called into the Sunday news shows on every major channel except Fox—was that, a minute or two after crudely insulting Kelly in a CNN interview (“And you know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her—wherever”), he had crudely insulted her colleague Chris Wallace in similar terms (“You know, blood pouring out of his eyes, too”). By “wherever,” he told George Stephanopoulos, on ABC, “I was referring to nose, ears. They’re very common statements. And only a deviant would think of what people said.” He hadn’t specified those parts, he said, because he just wanted to move on and talk about important things, like “jobs.” In fact, he moved on to talk about how Chris Wallace, in his view, compared to his father, Mike, the longtime CBS correspondent. “The great Mike Wallace was a friend of mine. In fact, he interviewed me on ‘60 Minutes.’ It was a phenomenal ‘60 Minutes’ .… And the son is only a tiny fraction of Mike, believe me.” The lady is a lightweight; the loser never lived up to his dad. These are stock characters in Trumpland, where one can also bump into the occasional Killer or Great Guy.","2473","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"There are, after all, a few problems with Trump’s argument that he was just, in the Wall Street Journal’s memorable phrase, using “facial hemorrhages as a metaphor for anger.” One can begin with the obvious: more of Kelly’s body was implicated than was Wallace’s, and Trump has a long history of slurs aimed at women’s anatomy, which was what Kelly was asking him about. But stranger still is the idea that there was any anger to describe, literally or metaphorically. “Look, she asked me a very nasty question. I have nothing against Megyn Kelly, but she asked me a very, very nasty question,” Trump said. She was “very inappropriate,” and “very angry.” And yet, in the video, she is calm, and never stops smiling. She did not, it is true, surrender or laugh appreciatively when he interrupted her to make a joke about how he thought another woman was ugly. Is that what an angry woman looks like from the Republican debate stage?","2474","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"If Trump is betrayed by the “wherever,” the Republican Party is undermined by its capacity to look at every manner of assault on women and say, in effect, “Whatever.” There is a muddle in the matter of the Party’s message on Trump and Kelly. For one thing, the Republican men rushing to Kelly’s defense do not look much like beacons. Erick Erickson, the conservative activist, said that he was so appalled that he was disinviting Trump from his RedState Gathering conference. Erickson is the man who called Wendy Davis, the Texas legislator, “Abortion Barbie,” and, writing about Michelle Obama, speculated about whether “Obama’s Marxist harpy wife would go Lorena Bobbitt on him.” Kelly once chastised Erickson on Fox for saying that wives contributing more to the family income than their husbands was unnatural and bad for children. (As I’ve written before, Kelly is a smart woman who, occasionally, stops pretending that the men around her at Fox are making any sense at all.) At the RedState conference, Jeb Bush congratulated Erickson on his gentlemanliness in disinviting Trump, saying, “I tell you what, you’re on the side of women.” Bush, who had turned to the topic when Erikson mentioned his wife, continued, “Come on! Give me a break. I mean, do we want to win? Do we want to insult fifty-three per cent of all voters? What Donald Trump said is wrong.”","2475","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"The problem is that Bush and the other Republicans are not clear in their own minds about why Trump is wrong. Last week, Bush said, “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women’s health issues” (he later said that he “misspoke”)—a quote Trump brought up on the Sunday shows, when talking about how he would be “phenomenal to the women” who were, themselves, phenomenal. There is plenty of menstruation-free misogyny at play, starting with the assumption that women are an alien group “we” have to be careful not to offend. The hope among Republicans is that they will never have to say whether their politely unspoken assumptions are the same as Trump’s loudly stated one—that, having roused the base, Trump is so crass that he will flame out. Jeb Bush seems particularly vulnerable to this presumption. But this does not seem to be a political moment in which tackiness alone is going to get someone off the debate stage. The greatest fear, within the G.O.P., seems to be that Trump will force them to look rude. And it has left them paralyzed.","2476","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"It was a classic Trump move to ask, with outrage and wounded innocence, why anyone would think that mentioning blood and a woman’s anger in the same sentence would have a certain implication. (It’s actually a decent question, as disingenuous as Trump was to pose it.) His G.O.P. opponents thought that the answer was too obvious and unpleasant to talk about. The offense for them was the application of a stereotype to Kelly. They weren’t about to engage with or challenge any stereotypes about women themselves.","2477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"
"When the other G.O.P. candidates challenge Trump, it tends to be by arguing that he is not a real Republican—he was once pro-choice, and he has given money to Democrats. On the first point, the G.O.P. risks alienating women voters when candidates, like Marco Rubio, rush to stake out ever more extreme positions on restricting reproductive rights, a point that Hillary Clinton seized upon on Monday. On the issue of political donations, Trump’s comment, in the debate, that he gives money to all sorts of candidates to buy access and to get them to do what he wants, has been a hard one for his opponents. They seem to find talking about their donors almost as mortifying as talking about Megyn Kelly’s body. At the debate, Trump had said that Clinton had to go to his wedding because he’s donated to her family’s foundation. Clinton said that she’d gone because she “thought it was going to be fun.” Did the G.O.P. think that a Trump candidacy would be fun, too?","2478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup?mbid=rss"

"On August 7th of last year, Crain’s ran an article about SketchFactor, an app that was set to launch the next day. It would allow users to report having seen or experienced something “sketchy” in a particular location; these reports would then be geotagged and overlaid on a Google map, creating a sketchiness heat map of a neighborhood or city. The idea was to help urban walkers be more street-smart, but the implications seemed insensitive at best, racist at worst. Allison McGuire, the app’s co-creator, had recently moved from Washington, D.C., to the West Village. Both she and her co-founder, Daniel Herrington, were white and in their twenties. At one point, the Crain’s reporter asked McGuire whether her company “could be vulnerable to criticisms regarding the degree to which race is used to profile a neighborhood.”","July 29, 2015","2480","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"
"“We understand that people will see this issue,” she said.

"A few hours later, Gothamist published a more pointed piece, under the headline “Tone-Deaf App Helps Naive Travelers Avoid ‘Sketchy’ Neighborhoods.” McGuire didn’t mind. “We were just excited to be mentioned somewhere else,” she told me recently. “Then I started getting texts and e-mails saying, ‘Have you seen the front page of Gawker?’ ” The headline there was more blunt: “Smiling Young White People Make App for Avoiding Black Neighborhoods.” There was a photograph of McGuire and Herrington, back to back, grinning. It probably didn’t help that the app’s icon was a black bubble with googly eyes.","2482","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"
"The writer Jamelle Bouie tweeted, “Are you afraid of black people? Latinos? The poors? Then this app is just for you!” Maxwell Strachan, writing for the Huffington Post, pointed out some of the problems with establishing a “rating system based on the personal views of Americans, a people historically known to mask the occasional racist view behind words like ‘dangerous’ ”—or, for that matter, “sketchy.” Many people pointed out that the app, which was ostensibly designed to “empower everyone,” would, in practice, empower only people who owned smartphones. SketchFactor’s Twitter feed was inundated with such hashtags as #racist, #classist, and #gentrification. The next day, the same journalist at Crain’s wrote an article about the Internet’s “full-throated condemnation” of the company. “I was in shock,” McGuire said. “And the app wasn’t even live yet.”","2483","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"
"SketchFactor never fully recovered. Businesses are path-dependent—what happens early has a disproportionately strong effect on what comes later—and this is especially true of businesses that rely on user-generated content. Unlike, say, a Web publication, whose tone can be set by its writers and commenters, the tenor of a social platform is largely determined by who is doing the socializing. SketchFactor was unexpectedly popular—it was, for a time, the third-most downloaded navigation app, behind Google Maps and Waze—but many of its first users were drawn in by the controversy. Some early “sketch reports” were actually pleas for the app to be taken down. Others were jokes (116th and Broadway: “pretentious undergrads”) or incomprehensible clutter (Atlanta: “This’s guy just kicked his dog ahhhhhhhhhhh”); still others were puerile outbursts or racist screeds. McGuire and her team encouraged users to downvote or report offensive posts, but they couldn’t remove them fast enough. Whether the idea was inherently racist or not, the app began to seem irredeemably toxic. The company released an update the following week and another one in October, but by winter they had stopped working on the app. In February of this year, they acknowledged that SketchFactor was not going to succeed. They decided to pivot.","2484","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"
"Like “disrupt” and “10x” and “culture fit,” “pivot” is an overused bit of tech-world jargon; but it’s also a useful word with a simple definition. Let’s say you try to start a company and the idea doesn’t take hold, as most ideas don’t. You can disband the company. Or you can keep your staff and some key part of your idea, jettison everything else, and rebuild. This is a pivot (though a better term might be “flatworm,” after the invertebrates that can be cut in half and then regenerate themselves). In 2005, Noah Glass and Evan Williams launched Odeo, a podcasting platform. The next year, they pivoted—Glass and Williams stayed on, but they worked on new platforms that had nothing to do with podcasting. Eventually, they changed their name to Twitter.","2485","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"
"Most companies pivot when they receive too little attention; SketchFactor’s pivot came after receiving too much negative attention. In February, McGuire changed her company’s name. (Had SketchFactor been named more innocuously in the first place, it might have attracted a different kind of audience; then again, it might have attracted no audience at all.) She and Herrington hired new staff and rebuilt around what she claims was always her core proposition: making city streets more walkable.","2486","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"

"McGuire bristled at the suggestion that her company’s pivot was a concession to public criticism. “We realized that we had built a social platform, and what we wanted to build was more of a utility,” she told me. “So we corrected. It’s that simple.” She did not express any self-doubt, and she gave little credence to the notion that SketchFactor was racist. “I’ve only ever been about helping people,” she said. “The fact that we were misconstrued was really painful for me.” I asked whether she had ever considered moving out of the West Village—say, to Brooklyn, where “sketch reports” were more plentiful—to field-test the app, or to see how locals responded to it. She said that she hadn’t.","2489","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"
"When we spoke, in June, she referred to SketchFactor in the past tense; but it was still live in the Apple, Google, and Amazon app stores. Hundreds of people had downloaded it since February, and sketch reports continued to trickle in, like graffiti in a ghost town. I asked her why she hadn’t removed the app. After all, it was not generating income—it cost nothing to download and contained no ads—and she did not plan to transfer SketchFactor’s user data to Walc. Ed Smith, an entrepreneur who has launched a handful of major apps including the ride-sharing service Sidecar, told me that, if he were in a similar situation, he would take down any dormant app that had the potential to “hurt my brand.” This is a “very simple” process, he said. “It can take just a few moments.”","2490","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"
"McGuire’s explanation, essentially, was carelessness. “As soon as we decided we were pivoting, we just didn’t touch SketchFactor at all. It takes time and energy and resources to do anything—editing it, pulling it, whatever.

"As I talked to McGuire, I tried to gauge how chastened she felt. Was her pivot only an economic decision, or was it also an ethical one? Did she think of herself solely as a victim of cyberbullying, or could she understand why her critics saw her as a perpetrator of it?

Later, she said that, before she met Herrington, she had planned to found SketchFactor with two female friends. “One of them is gay and one of them is black,” she said. “We all had our own experiences, our own ideas about what we wanted to help people avoid in the streets.” I was surprised. I had read everything I could find about SketchFactor; if the company’s origin story included two other co-founders, this was the first I was hearing about it. I asked McGuire several times to share their names, or to make them available for comment, but she refused.","2513","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"
"Some of the people I met in Bed-Stuy, and others on Twitter, had suggested that SketchFactor was a cynical attempt to profit from bigotry. It seemed to me that McGuire’s motives were innocent, or that she thought they were. Still, inadvertently or not, the app had played on racist stereotypes; and it might have reduced local businesses’ profits or poured fuel on the fire of gentrification. The concept of sketchiness is inseparable from prejudice: if American cities were not riven by inequality and fear, there would have been no market for SketchFactor. In light of all this, it seemed that the best way for McGuire to fail up would be to acknowledge some culpability, and to promise that Walc would do better.","2514","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"

"McGuire, who received unwelcome attention from Internet trolls, has reasons to feel aggrieved. Still, I was surprised at how she was choosing to frame her story. In the recent book “So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed,” the journalist Jon Ronson meets several people who have been brought low by online hordes. Some of them are indignant; others are self-lacerating. All of them, with one exception, offer some sort of apology. (The exception, a man who was accused of hosting a Nazi-themed sex orgy, is so unflappable, so anomalous in his inability to feel shame, that it becomes one of the book’s central mysteries.) Not all of the apologies are good ones. The one offered by the monologist Mike Daisey, whose work conflated truth and fiction, is particularly evasive. But even Daisey, at one point, manages to spit out the words “I’m sorry.”","2517","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"
"This was the first interview McGuire had granted in months. Setting it up had required weeks of negotiation. She had clearly spent time and money crafting a media plan; yet that plan did not seem to include a one-sentence apology, even a qualified one of the “I’m sorry you got upset” variety. Perhaps she had been advised to project unalloyed confidence. This seemed, at the very least, like a bad tactical decision.","2518","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist"

"One night not long ago, in a new restaurant in Havana called VIPs, the owner, a white-haired Catalan named Jordi, was speculating about what life might be like in Cuba after a reconciliation with the United States. “Come, let me show you,” he said confidingly, leading the way to a large outdoor space between the neighboring building and his own, an eighteenth-century villa built for a Spanish marqués. Gesturing with his hands, Jordi indicated where he was building an open-air bar and eatery, a wine cellar, a “chill-out area.” “It will be a club for friends,” Jordi said. “Friends with money.”","2524","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Inside, Hugo Cancio, one of Jordi’s friends in the new transnational élite, sat at a corner table. A Cuban-American businessman, Cancio lives in Miami but shuttles to Havana so often that the VIPs menu has named his favorite dish for him: the Don Hugo Paella. Cancio is fifty-one, tall, with an athlete’s shoulders and a limber gait. He was accompanied by his daughter Christy, who had recently finished college in the U.S. Their table looked out on a square bar, a dozen tables full of smartly dressed people, and a huge screen, with Chaplin’s “Modern Times” on a continuous loop. On his iPhone 6, Cancio showed me a selfie that he and Christy had taken earlier that day with Conan O’Brien, who was in Havana taping his show. O’Brien had invited them to join him at El Aljibe, an open-air restaurant that is popular with diplomats and Cuba’s senior nomenclatura. “What do you think?” Cancio asked me, smiling. “Cuba’s changing, man.”","2525","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Last December, after five decades of Cold War enmity and eighteen months of secret talks, the United States and Cuba announced that they had agreed to normalize relations. It was a rapprochement so long in coming that younger generations, without much memory of invasions, embargoes, and the threat of nuclear obliteration, barely knew why the bad feeling was so ingrained in the politics of both countries. Cancio is a casualty, like many others, of all that preceded this tentative settlement. He left Cuba in the Mariel boatlift of 1980, in which as many as a hundred and twenty thousand Cubans made a traumatic exodus to the United States. Thirty-five years later, as the C.E.O. of a holding company called Fuego Enterprises, he moves freely between Cuba and the U.S. After spending years cultivating connections in both countries, he has become an intermediary sought after by the increasing numbers of Americans—investors, politicians, celebrities—who are going to Cuba. He is pleased to tell you about his private meeting with Sting, or with Paris Hilton. When Google visited Havana recently, a delegation came to his office to discuss the local situation. In February, Cancio spoke to a gathering of political conservatives in Washington, D.C., and in April he addressed an audience in New York at a conference about Cuba organized by the Wharton School of Business.","2526","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio is recognizably Cuban, but he is also a man of earnest American discipline. He meditates and does a hundred pushups each morning. His bedtime reading lately is Hillary Clinton’s “Hard Choices” and a volume by Deepak Chopra. In 2012, he launched OnCuba, a bimonthly magazine stocked with ads, profiles of artists and musicians, and articles on tourist destinations. In the past year, he has added a quarterly art magazine, aimed at collectors and investors, and a real-estate supplement. Cancio has ambitious plans to expand Fuego Enterprises. In 2010, after Raúl Castro announced sweeping reforms to open up the island’s economy, allowing more Cubans to own their own businesses—known as cuentapropismo—and to buy and sell property, Cancio assembled a team to assess investment possibilities. He and his partners decided to focus on media and entertainment, and then move into real estate, tourism, and telecommunications. “Our goal was to position ourselves quickly, so when the market opened we would be among the first to be established,” he said.","2527","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"For now, Fuego is distinguished more by its potential than by its assets. “If you look at the financials of the company, it’s a very speculative investment and not a lot to get excited about,” Thomas Herzfeld, who manages the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, one of Fuego’s largest investors, said. “But if you look at Hugo there’s everything to get excited about. He’s a leading expert on Cuba, he’s well respected there, he cares about Cuba and its people.”","2528","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio told me that it will likely take three to five years to see real change in Cuba. In the meantime, the island, like any other country undergoing a radical transformation, is a confounding place to do business. In recent decades, businesses from Europe and Canada have invested in Cuba, with uneven results; many deals dissolve, with investors disappointed by returns or frustrated by the exigencies of working with Castro’s government. In a few cases, foreign businessmen have been abruptly jailed, on vague charges of corruption, and their businesses seized. Cancio’s partner Ariel Machado, also a Cuban, jokes about nightmares in which a shadowy rival reaches out to chop off his hand with a machete.","2529","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio puts a sunny face on all this complexity. He claims that he “loves uncertainty,” and has faith in the leadership of both countries: “I admire President Obama. And I’ve always admired Fidel Castro. I use him as an example when I am invaded by discouragement—which doesn’t happen much—because this is a man who had an idea and persuaded eighty other people to face an army of fifty thousand, and to cross an ocean to do it. So when people told me you can’t open a media space in Cuba I say, well, Fidel did his revolution.”","2530","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"To a visitor, Havana appears much the same as it has for decades––people at loose ends, distressed buildings—but there has been an explosion of small private enterprises and, with them, pockets of encouraging prosperity. For the first time since the sixties, when Castro declared a “revolutionary offensive” to “eliminate all manifestations of private trade,” Cubans are being allowed to take charge of their material lives. People are better dressed; there are more cars on the road; and everywhere there are new restaurants and bars and hostels, where Cubans rent rooms to foreign visitors. In early April, Airbnb announced the launch of Cuban operations; by month’s end, Governor Andrew Cuomo had flown in with a planeload of New York business executives for a trade summit, and an N.B.A. good-will delegation had set up training camps for Cuban athletes. On May 5th, the U.S. Treasury Department lifted restrictions on ferry services from Florida; the same day, Jet Blue said that it planned to begin flying between Havana and New York.","2531","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Tourism has surged nearly twenty per cent this year, and hotel lobbies in Havana are noisy with troubadours singing “Guantanamera” and odes to Che Guevara; buses and luridly painted old Chevys trundle sightseers around the city. There are Europeans, Canadians, Brazilians; one morning, I saw a group of elderly Chinese visitors dressed in safari clothing exploring the grounds of La Finca Vigía, Hemingway’s home.","2532","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Increasingly, there are also Americans, mostly sixty-somethings on “cultural tours” but also college students and hipsters from New York and Los Angeles. People in Havana joke that the latest accessory for an evening out is an American friend. The city’s harbor is being refurbished to accommodate U.S. cruise ships. Cancio’s new travel arm, OnCuba Travel, offers guided tours to Americans with the slogan “Be the first to witness the rise of free enterprise in Cuba.”","2533","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Havana’s night life, once moribund, is alive again. In a former peanut-oil factory, La Fábrica de Arte Cubano hosts dancers, filmmakers, painters, photographers, and musicians. Across town, the Las Vegas Cabaret features a transvestite show. Havana, long a Soviet-style culinary wasteland, is now a fine place to go out for Spanish, Italian, Iranian, Turkish, Swedish, or Chinese, in restaurants frequented by foreigners but also by newly moneyed Cubans—what one of Cancio’s young writers, Carlos Manuel Álvarez, describes as “specimens at the midway gallop between Cuba’s iron socialist morality and a certain post-realignment Havana consumerism.”","2534","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"One day this spring, as I rode through the city in a taxi, a glossy black BMW raced past, and a policeman at the next intersection gave the driver a deferential salute. Until recently, the only known wealthy Cubans were a handful of musicians and athletes who, in a special government dispensation meant to dissuade them from leaving, were permitted to keep their foreign earnings. Even so, few were ostentatious, and, if they bought cars, they drove Peugeots or Hyundais. My taxi-driver explained that the car’s owner was probably an “entertainer.” Another Cuban musician, he told me wistfully, owned a Ferrari.","2535","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Officially, Cuba’s changes are intended to bring about “more socialism,” but few Cubans seem to believe that. “We’re not only making peace with the Americans,” one senior Cuban official told me. “We’re changing everything. But not even those of us involved in the process know what that means yet.” Cuba seems bound on a course not unlike that of Vietnam and China: hybrid Communist states in which citizens enjoy few political liberties but significant economic freedom.","2536","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cubans like Cancio have deduced that expressions of resentment will get them nowhere. One day, a pop-up protest blocked a road tunnel at the end of the Malecón, Havana’s seaside corniche. Several dozen of the Damas de Blanco—the Ladies in White, relatives of imprisoned dissidents—had gathered to hold up flowers and pictures of their loved ones and to shout, “Down with the dictatorship!” Within ten minutes, police had herded the Damas onto buses and driven them away. All that was left was a mysterious group of civilians, shouting loyalist chants, and a few watchful policemen.","2537","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"All around the city, even as los cambios—the changes—take root, there is a world-weary acceptance of the revolution’s persistence and of its mistakes. When I asked Cancio what it meant to be a Marielito, he quoted a speech that Castro gave during the crisis, in which he repudiated the Cubans who had chosen to leave the country: “We don’t want them and we don’t need them.” Cancio shrugged, smiled, and said, “Well, here I am.”","2538","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Hugo Cancio’s base in Havana— his office and his apartment—occupies the ninth floor of a fifties-era high-rise that overlooks the Malecón. The building has a quasi-official atmosphere, a remnant of the years in which every Cuban enterprise was run by the government. It once housed the operations room for Fidel’s Battle of Ideas, a campaign to rekindle revolutionary fervor that has been superseded by Raúl’s Changes. In the lobby, a pair of brusque concierges keep watch, and an elevator attendant sits all day, mutely pushing buttons.","2539","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"The OnCuba office has a sleek lounge, whose gray-and-white walls are decorated with lyrics by the Cuban musician Silvio Rodríguez. One of them reads, “I prefer to talk of impossible things, because of the possible too much is already known.” In three workrooms, a half-dozen young Cubans sit intently at white benches with new large-screen Apple computers.","2540","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Although the offices are in Havana, OnCuba is not officially distributed there; Cancio is accredited by Cuba’s Foreign Ministry as a representative of the foreign press. OnCuba is printed in the U.S., distributed on charter flights that fly between Florida and Cuba, and sold at American supermarkets, bookstores, and newsstands. There are stories about rickshaw drivers, skaters, ballerinas, and this summer’s Art Biennial. The magazine avoids politics, but it reports, boosterishly, on the burgeoning U.S.-Cuba relationship. Last year, Joe Garcia, a Cuban-American congressman from Florida, caused controversy when he signalled that he might be in favor of ending the trade embargo against Cuba. Cancio put him on the cover.","2541","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cubans have always shown great initiative in finding alternatives to the anodyne government-sponsored news. For years, moonlighting engineers installed satellite dishes in homes, to bring in forbidden television shows. La bola, Cuba’s bush telegraph, transmits news around the island long before it is covered by state media. The latest innovation is el paquete (the package), an electronic bundle of weekly news and entertainment, packed onto a USB stick and delivered by couriers on motorbikes. A few months ago, Cancio assigned a story on the subject, and the reporters found that el paquete was effectively the island’s largest private business: it employs forty-five thousand Cubans, brings in one and a half million dollars a week, and reaches five million people—nearly half of Cuba’s population. After the report, Cancio negotiated with the head of el paquete to have OnCuba included.","2542","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"The magazine’s Web site also reaches many Cubans, as well as government minders, and that is where it occasionally runs into trouble. To lead the investigative reporting team, Cancio hired an Uruguayan journalist named Fernando Ravsberg, who worked for the BBC in Cuba for two decades. Last summer, his reporters began covering places around the city where authorities were not regularly collecting garbage. At a disposal site on the outskirts, the journalists discovered a fetid encampment, where scavengers raked through garbage for items to sell. In Cuba, where the government has long boasted of its social-welfare system, such sights are shocking. “We did the garbage story,” Ravsberg said, “and afterward, lo and behold, the state television came along and reported on it.”","2543","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"OnCuba reports on social ills as a crusading local paper might in the United States—enough to rile the authorities but not enough to be seen as subversive. Ravsberg cautioned his reporters not to overemphasize the scavengers’ miserable lives. “They are young and were naturally affected by that, so I had to make them understand that it had to be put into the proper context,” he explained. “Which Latin-American country does not have people living in garbage?”","2544","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"One day in the office, I found Cancio talking with an editor about a photograph that he wanted removed from the Web site. Cancio told me that the photograph depicted a poet who had once been censured by the Party. “The person in that photo isn’t even mentioned in the article. I don’t think they even knew who the poet was. So my question was: ‘What is the purpose of the photo, what does it contribute?’ ” When I asked Cancio about his role as house censor, he gave a tortuous explanation: “The purpose of our project is not to hurt anyone’s feelings. It is to unite, find common points of exchange, educate, change hearts and minds. We want to be faithful to the truth and to a new and dignified journalism for the country, but, if we can avoid hurting sensitivities unnecessarily, we should.” But, he added, he had hired youngsters who were “not contaminated with paradigms and ideologies that can lead to incomprehension. I want to surround myself with people who love their country unconditionally but who are not bound to old and obsolete ideas.”","2545","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio was born in 1964—five years after Fidel Castro seized power—into a family of entertainers. His father, Miguel Cancio, founded the popular sixties band Los Zafiros, along with one of his mother’s seven siblings, most of whom were also singers and musicians. Los Zafiros were inspired by the harmonious doo-wop of the Platters, but also incorporated influences from Cuban music and bossa nova. (The band’s hit “I Have Come” was revived in “Breaking Bad,” playing winsomely as Walter White’s R.V.-cum-meth lab is destroyed by a bulldozer.)","2546","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"With his parents often away on tour, Cancio was looked after by his grandmother, and though he showed talent as a percussionist, he was dismayed by his family’s bohemianism. He recalls waking up before school to find the living room full of drunk musicians and coming home in the afternoon to find some of them still there, sleeping. “I decided then and there I didn’t want to be a musician,” he said.","2547","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio wanted instead to be a doctor, like his grandfather, and he managed good enough grades to attend a boarding school in the province of Matanzas. Then, one night, when he was sixteen, he was caught telling a forbidden joke to other students in their dormitory bunks. Cancio recalls that it was one of the Pepito jokes, based on a beloved Cuban character, a smart-ass boy who pokes fun at everyone: “One day, Fidel asks his bodyguards to bring Pepito to tell him jokes; he wanted to laugh. So his bodyguards go to Pepito’s house. Pepito was just waking up and didn’t want to come, because he hadn’t yet had his breakfast, but he finally went. When he got to Fidel’s house, Fidel told Pepito he could have whatever he wanted. So Pepito asks for a hearty breakfast. When he is done eating, Fidel tells him, ‘Pepito, I want you to know that soon all the children of Cuba will be eating a breakfast like the one you’ve had today.’ Pepito says to Fidel, ‘Did you bring me here to tell tales, or for you to tell them to me?’ ”","2548","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio and his friends were hauled in by the school authorities, forced to recant in front of their peers, and told that they were being expelled. “They said we had betrayed the trust of the revolution,” Cancio recalled. “From that moment on, I basically no longer had a future in the country, and my mother said we were going to have to go.”","2549","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"In those days, there was virtually no legal way to leave Cuba. Then, in April, 1980, the Peruvian Embassy grounds in Havana were overrun by thousands of Cubans seeking asylum. After an acrimonious standoff, Castro announced that all those who wished to leave could do so from the nearby port of Mariel—as long as they had a boat to take them. As Cuban-Americans scrambled to Mariel in yachts to evacuate relatives, Fidel saw an opportunity to get rid of Cuba’s unwanted: State Security agents brought thousands of criminals from Cuba’s jails and inmates from mental asylums and loaded them onto boats.","2550","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Mariel offered an unexpected way out for Cancio, along with his mother and his younger sister. Cancio recalled, “My mother told me that, to be able to go, I’d have to appear before a panel and say I was a homosexual. So I did that. I remember one of the panel members asked me, ‘Are you a passive or an active homosexual?’ ” Laughing, Cancio told me, “I didn’t know what that meant, so I said, ‘Both things.’ ”","2551","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio was taken to a holding facility in Havana, then to one near Mariel, a camp for unaccompanied males, where prospective émigrés waited along with newly released criminals. He was frightened, and worried about his mother and sister, from whom he had been forcibly separated. After a few weeks, he was put on a luxurious American cabin cruiser. As the boat left Mariel harbor, Cancio panicked and tried to dive overboard and swim ashore, but the American captain calmed him.","2552","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"In Miami, Cancio was reunited with his mother and sister, who had come on another boat, and they spent several days in the Orange Bowl, where refugees were kept until their relatives or social services could provide housing. Cancio recalls that he viewed his new surroundings as “a world of infinite possibilities”—a phrase that he still repeats, like a slogan. After a few months, the Cancios were given permanent accommodations in South Miami Beach, in a run-down Deco apartment building at Fourth and Collins.","2553","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Because of the criminals in their midst, the Marielitos quickly acquired a fearsome reputation in the United States. In Brian De Palma’s 1983 remake of “Scarface,” the vicious drug dealer Tony Montana is a Marielito. Not long after Cancio and his family moved to Miami, another Marielito pulled a gun on him and his sister outside their building. Cancio’s mother, terrified of the crime in their neighborhood, forbade her daughter to go out on her own.","2554","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio graduated from Miami Beach High and went to work, as a busboy in a kosher restaurant, then as a security guard, then hawking clothes at a flea market. He got a break selling cars at a Mitsubishi dealership, and within six months he’d become the sales manager. He moved on to a BMW dealership, and from there to pioneer Hyundai’s sales operation in South Florida. One night, he met a young woman, Marian, of Puerto Rican extraction. They began living together, and they had a daughter, Cherie, and then Christy. By his mid-twenties, he said, “I had bought my first home, with a pool, and lived there with my family.”","2555","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"One day, during a trip to the Cayman Islands, he met a visiting Cuban tourism official who confided that Cuba and the U.S. were about to authorize “family reunification trips.” Cancio returned to Miami and opened a travel agency offering “Viajes a Cuba.” He also got an OFAC license—a waiver from the U.S. Treasury Department to do business with Cuba. When the family visits were duly authorized, Cancio says, his business was “all ready to go.”","2556","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Despite his success in the United States, Cancio was overwhelmed by nostalgia for Cuba. In December, 1993, he and his sister returned to spend Christmas with family in Varadero. Cancio teared up as he recalled knocking on relatives’ doors to surprise them. At the family house, boyhood friends came over to say hello, except for one, who had joined Cuban State Security. “I went to his house, a couple of streets away, and I shouted at him,” Cancio said. “But he didn’t come out.”","2557","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"In April, 1994, with the Cuban economy suffering from the loss of Soviet subsidies, the Castro government held a conference to promote reconciliation with the exile community in Florida. It was a major about-face. Castro had repudiated the Cubans who left as gusanos—worms—and forbidden them to return home; he referred to Florida’s Cuban exile community as la Mafia de Miami. Cancio, who describes himself as “naïve and politically out of the loop at the time,” nevertheless found himself on the list of Cuban-Americans who were invited to the conference. He made a number of connections there, including several well-placed officials who have remained his friends.","2558","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"On the last day, the attendees stood in line, and one by one they were introduced to Fidel Castro for a quick handshake and a photograph. As Cancio waited, he told me, “I thought about all the people who wanted to kill him, and then worried that his bodyguards could read my mind. But I didn’t feel any hatred or animosity toward him. There he was: tall, pinkish, long hands and long nails. I saw him calling people by name. When it was my turn, he asked how my father was. He had seen a documentary about Los Zafiros.”","2559","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio watched the documentary—a portrayal of the decline of Los Zafiros, whose members had mostly succumbed to alcoholism—and decided to make his own film, focussing on the band’s “height of success, rather than on their disintegration.” He raised money, got permission to shoot in Cuba, and persuaded his father to be his chief consultant on location. “The film threw me into the entertainment world—the world of my family—but as a producer, not as a performer,” Cancio said. “Zafiros, Blue Madness” had its première in 1997 at the Cine Payret, in Old Havana, and won the People’s Choice Award at the Havana Film Festival that year.","2560","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"When he showed the movie in Miami, though, members of the anti-Castro exile community staged an angry demonstration, and a woman spat in Cancio’s face. “It turned me into an activist to exercise my right in favor of cultural exchange,” he said. He began to bring a different Cuban band to the United States every month, and formed a company to produce music videos. It was a sensible gambit: for decades, music had been among Cuba’s most popular legal exports. Cancio mostly lost money on the bands’ tours, however, and his dealings with the regime infuriated Miami Cubans; he received threats, and a bomb was set off at a night club where one of his bands was booked. But the Cuban connection was lucrative in other ways. He brokered a deal between Cayman Airways and Cuba’s official travel agency, opening up a way for Cuban-Americans to bypass the U.S. travel ban. Then, in February, 1996, two small airplanes piloted by anti-Castro exiles planning to drop propaganda leaflets over Havana were shot down, killing four Cuban-Americans. President Clinton signed a stringent new sanctions package—which, for Cancio, provided an opportunity. While most of the other Cuba-focussed travel agencies “scrambled to reinvent themselves,” Cancio took his customers and put them on planes to Cuba via the Cayman Islands. “I made a bundle of cash,” he said.","2561","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"During the Bush years, things became difficult again: in 2003, in a crackdown timed to coincide with the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Castro arrested seventy-five dissidents, human-rights activists, and journalists, ushering in a period known as the Black Spring. After Cancio wrote an article condemning the repression, he was not allowed back into Cuba for a year. Angry, he stayed away for four more. He concentrated on producing music and investing in Florida real estate; he also set up a lobbying group, Cambio Cubano, to advocate against the U.S. embargo.","2562","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"After Barack Obama took office, and tensions between Cuba and the U.S. subsided, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington contacted Cancio, asking him for a copy of “Zafiros.” It was an overture. When a half sister in Cuba fell ill, Cancio was granted an emergency humanitarian visa to see her. During his visit, Cancio says, he was summoned for a meeting with members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. “They told me that they wanted me to resume my cultural activities on behalf of Cuba, and they apologized” for not allowing him to return. Cancio said that he would criticize Castro again if it seemed warranted. “At the same time, I told them I would never do anything against my country.” For the government, Cancio was an appealing figure: a Cuban-American capitalist who was also a patriot, and not averse to working within the Party’s limitations—especially if his business got a boost.","2563","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"After returning to Miami, Cancio began signing up big-ticket Cuban groups for concerts in the U.S.: Los Van Van, NG La Banda, Pablo Milanés. He booked Silvio Rodríguez for his first U.S. tour, including a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall. “We sold 1.8 million dollars’ worth of tickets,” he told me.","2564","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"In 2011, the Cuban cardinal, Jaime Ortega, told Cancio that he had spoken with Raúl and become convinced that a transformation was coming. “I realized that my country was changing enormously,” Cancio said. “I decided to get a lot more involved in the United States in helping look for a change of policy toward Cuba.” He also met with Cuban officials, and told them that they “needed to be more open to Miami Cubans, too, and not treat us like fucking immigrants.” In 2012, Cuba passed a new immigration law that lifted long-standing travel restrictions; it also permitted Cubans living in Miami to visit without overt stigma or sanction. “The rhetoric changed,” Cancio said. “You no longer hear us referred to as la Mafia de Miami. We began to feel more at home in our country.” He added, “They know that most of the new businesses opening up in Cuba are being done with Miami money.”","2565","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Much of the investment coming into “the new Cuba” is opaque, but in Havana it is easy to see the signs of American money: glitzy new bars and restaurants, financed by investors in Miami and elsewhere. Since 2009, Obama has been raising the limits on remittances, and at least two billion dollars a year is now flowing into the country. Many of the homes being bought and restored in Cuba are also financed with Miami money, either with loans from Cuban-Americans to their relatives or with outright investments. The new property law allows only Cuban citizens to buy and sell real estate, so there is a booming business for front people, called testaferros. Cuban-Americans have an advantage, being required only to legally reacquire their Cuban nationality. Many are apparently doing so, and hanging on to their U.S. citizenship as well. In Havana, I met a successful Miami night-club owner who is converting his family’s old home into a boutique hotel. He flies back to Miami every couple of months to bring cash from his U.S. bank in order to pay for the work.","2566","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"The club owner told me that he also does much of his shopping back home. Despite the new money, in many places consumer goods still aren’t available; Havana remains a challenging place to buy a Phillips screwdriver or a pair of Nikes. In Varadero, I met a friend of Cancio’s who had left with him from Mariel, thirty-five years ago. He explained that he flew each month to Miami, where he had worked for years as a waiter and as a taxi-driver, to pick up his Social Security check. He returned to Havana with a duffelbag stuffed full of consumer items to hand off to a fence and a few to sell: “Three cell phones, ten Lycras, ten toothpastes, ten vitamins, ten Omega-8s.” Between goods that he smuggled into Cuba and rum and cigars that he took back to Miami, he earned an extra five hundred dollars a month—just enough to live on, he said.","2567","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"One afternoon in Miami, Cancio drove me around in his black 7 Series BMW, passing Fourth and Collins, where the Marielito had pulled a gun on him and his sister. The neighborhood had changed a lot, he said. At South Point, which overlooks the waterway from the ocean to Miami Harbor, he pointed to the tallest apartment tower and informed me that Tom Herzfeld, his backer at Fuego, owned its triplex penthouse.","2568","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Cancio wanted a hamburger, so we drove to Lincoln Road Mall, an upscale pedestrian shopping strip. Cancio was wearing his usual gear—a designer polo shirt, fitted jeans, and Gucci loafers. He had on a distinctive gold watch with Gothic lettering. “It’s a Cuervo y Sobrinos,” he explained, a defunct Cuban brand that had been revived by a Swiss watchmaker; he had bought his at the factory, in Lugano. As we waited for our food, Cancio toyed with his iPhone, monitoring a series of e-mails, texts, and phone calls. One e-mail was from a prominent Cuban-American businessman with ties to Google, who wanted to confer about the employees’ visit. Messages came in steadily, and he announced each one. As he finished his fries, he indicated a new one, from the editor of Billboard.","2569","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"When potential investors visit Cuba, Cancio introduces them to local residents, as well as to businesspeople. “If you want to do business here you have to know the people and the culture,” he said. The key introductions he provides are to government officials, some of whom wield considerable authority over the economy. As a middleman, Cancio knows that his success depends on delivering results to both the U.S. and Cuba, without prejudice. He likes to point out that, with each step toward restoring diplomatic relations, Fuego’s stock has risen. A large American P.R. firm recently signed a contract with Cancio to represent clients who are interested in doing business in Cuba. So far, the most significant changes in U.S. law are loosened restrictions on travel and telecommunications, and Fuego is striving to take advantage. It owns MAScell, a Miami-based phone-card firm that is now operating in Cuba, and Cancio has also secured exclusive deals with two U.S. telecommunications firms, which he would identify only as “midsized, with annual revenues of five to seven hundred million dollars.” He said, “For them, we’ve been doing a study of the Cuban market for potential business opportunities.”","2570","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Around the time Fuego launched its real-estate magazine, it began bringing tourists to Cuba, hosting lunch visits at OnCuba’s offices. At one of those sessions, Cancio spoke to twenty-five Americans of retirement age. As the tourists—comfortable shoes, bottled water—asked questions, he gave them what sounded curiously like a political stump speech. “OnCuba is a way to show that Cuba is changing—a new country, more tolerant, with defects, yes, but one that is changing,” he said. The new Cuba he envisioned was “defined not only by the Castro brothers, or their enemies, or any particular group, but by the whole Cuban family.”","2571","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"That new Cuba is unlikely to come as fast as Cancio would like. Frank Mora, the director of the Latin-American studies center at Florida International University, and a former Deputy Assistant U.S. Secretary of Defense under Obama, told me that governments on both sides are slowed by caution and internal resistance. Of Cuba, he said, “The regime is overwhelmed at the moment, and there’s an element of improvisation—as always with the Cubans—so they are going to go very slowly.” The model is Vietnam, not China, he said. “They fear the speed of China’s transition, and Tiananmen Square is their nightmare.”","2572","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Mora suggested that there was no certainty that more capitalism would lead to more democracy. “I think Obama is making a bet that this will help make the Cubans the agents of their own change,” he said. “I think Raúl is making a bet that this will ultimately strengthen the hand of the Party. There will be people making more money, and some may transfer that economic power to a desire for political reform. On the other hand, those same people may help put the brakes on by supporting the regime, so as to protect their investments.”","2573","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Despite the excitement in the United States, American investment in Cuba is still essentially notional. “The number is zero,” John Kavulich, the president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, told me. Although Obama has introduced a few exceptions to the U.S. embargo, much of it still stands. And its effect is compounded in Cuba by what Kavulich described as an “internal embargo.” As Kavulich points out, you can give a relative in Holguín money to start a hair salon, but he’ll need to ask the local bureaucracy for a license to import shampoo.","2574","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Luis René Fernández Tabío, an economist who does research for the government, said that Cuba must be wary. “If the free market were allowed here, there would be nothing left for the Cubans in seventy-two hours,” he said. “The challenge for us is to make sure the Cuban population understands that socialism is the way to vouchsafe Cuba’s national sovereignty. A prosperous and sustainable socialism.” When Obama and Castro appeared on television to announce the restoration of relations, Obama stood and talked in detail about the future he hoped to encourage in Cuba. Raúl Castro, wearing a military uniform, remained in his seat and spoke in generalities—a display of ambivalence that Cubans have not failed to interpret. Although his government has entertained many proposals from U.S. businesses, it has committed to almost none. The government, which controls three-quarters of the economy, is far more concerned with policing than with growth. The Cuban-American lawyer Pedro Freyre, who represents a number of companies interested in doing business in Cuba, told me, “If the Cubans could run their economy the way they run State Security, then Cuba will be the next Singapore.” But as long as the Castros are alive everything will depend on being able to deal with the government.","2575","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"When I asked Cancio about the difficulties of negotiating with the government, he took a long time to answer: “It’s, uh, it’s not a comfortable place to be.” A few days earlier, he’d been summoned by officials to discuss a complaint. The meeting had gone on for three hours. “They came over all flattering, like, ‘We love what you do,’ ” he said. “ ‘It’s not us, but some guy in the bureaucracy who doesn’t understand anything. You don’t want to jeopardize everything you’ve done over one little thing.’ ” Cancio explained that there was a group of hard-liners within the Department of Revolutionary Orientation who opposed him. Their channel for attacking him was a small group of Cuban journalists, who called him “the Americans’ Trojan horse.” But Ravsberg suggested that Cancio had allies, too: “Cancio is atendido”—meaning, roughly, protected—“at a very high level, above the Ideological Department.” Who would that be? “Technically, the next person higher is Díaz-Canel.” Miguel Díaz-Canel is the Vice-President, picked to succeed Raúl Castro when he steps down, in 2018. “And then it’s Raúl.”","2576","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"Over lunch, Cancio said that if he had a guardian angel he didn’t know who it was. “I have always thought that I don’t have any clout, but that they are using me,” as a test of how far the cambios can extend without threatening the Party’s authority. Cancio told me that a well-connected Cuban friend had recently called to invite him to his house. “He said, ‘I have some guys here who are talking about you.’ I got there, and there were three officials, and they were drinking Blue Label. I recognized one of them. He had caused me problems years before. When he saw me, he exclaimed, ‘This guy, he’s a son of a bitch.’ Then he said, ‘Drink with me.’ And he said to his friends, ‘This son of a bitch has won a space in Cuba, more even than we have, maybe. He’s a cabrón’ ”—a clever bastard. What the man said was resentful, but it was also a grudging recognition of a slow but profound change. “He kept saying, ‘You’re a cabrón, man, and you deserve everything you’ve achieved.’ ” ♦","2577","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/opening-for-business"
"After the riots in Baltimore, and then the sudden, unexpected criminal charges against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked the United States Department of Justice to conduct an audit of her police department and make recommendations for reform. “We all know that Baltimore continues to have a fractured relationship between the police and the community,” Rawlings-Blake said. “I’m willing to do what it takes to reform my department.”","May 12, 2015","2578","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-police-reform-look-like"

"The request for help from Washington, though, amounted to an implicit admission that Rawlings-Blake did not know what that reform should look like. The mayor of Baltimore, like mayors in most cities, appoints the police commissioner, and Rawlings-Blake named the current chief, Anthony Batts, in 2012. The Justice Department often steps in when the political leadership of a city proves unable or unwilling to address problems with the local police; that’s what happened in Ferguson, Missouri, following the death of Michael Brown. But Rawlings-Blake isn’t resistant to scrutiny; to the contrary, she invites it. Her problem is that she appears to have little idea what to do.","2580","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-police-reform-look-like"
"Rawlings-Blake’s perplexity may seem peculiar—aren’t mayors supposed to know how to address the problems in their own cities?–but her dilemma may be more understandable than it at first appears. The deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police, beginning with Brown, last August, have brought widespread attention to the issue of race relations in law enforcement. This focus has not generated any real consensus on what would be appropriate solutions. Rather, the current crisis in criminal justice has proved, in significant part, to be a vehicle for the exercise of preëxisting prejudices.","2581","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-police-reform-look-like"
"Consider the claim that family breakdown, absent fathers, and lack of parental discipline are to blame for both violence within the black community and conflicts with police. This constellation of issues tends to be cited by conservatives. Toya Graham, the Baltimore mother who was caught on video smacking her sixteen-year-old son, who appeared to be joining the rioting, briefly became a folk hero. Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post saluted Graham in an editorial: “If hauling your son out of a violent confrontation with police is abuse, we need more abusive parents. In days of yore, everyone would’ve seen Graham’s actions as what they were: old-fashioned discipline.” It is true that children who grow up in intact homes tend to have better chances in life than those who do not. But one can recognize the problem of broken families (Graham is raising six children as a single parent) without endorsing a mother’s attack on her son.","2582","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-police-reform-look-like"
"Moreover, conservatives rarely explain how intact families, valuable as they are, can provide jobs in communities like Baltimore, where about thirty-seven per cent of black men are unemployed, compared with ten per cent of white men. Other cities report similar data, and liberals often use it to counter claims that black families are at issue. Conservatives push culture, liberals stress economics, and neither is entirely wrong—or right.","2583","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-police-reform-look-like"
"Following Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson, community policing emerged as a popular panacea. There is a mismatch in Ferguson between the racial makeup of its police force (overwhelmingly white) and its population (overwhelmingly black). The death of a young black man at the hands of a white officer seemed like a tragic outgrowth of this misalliance. But Freddie Gray died at the hands of a police force that is nearly as integrated as the city of Baltimore, and that is headed by an African-American commissioner. Of the officers charged in his death, three are black and three are white. Again, a police force that looks like the city it patrols is a good idea, but hardly a guarantee of racial peace or skillful law enforcement.","2584","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-police-reform-look-like"
"Hillary Clinton contributed to the debate by calling for all police officers to wear body cameras, which would, in theory, resolve ambiguities about encounters with the public. But the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island, at the hands of the New York City Police Department, was captured on video—which did not conclusively resolve the question of whether the police acted unlawfully.","2585","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-police-reform-look-like"
"I discovered the limits of admirable attempts to address racial disparities in law enforcement when I went to Milwaukee earlier this year, to look at the innovative work being done by the local district attorney, John Chisholm. (I wrote about Chisholm in the magazine.) After Chisholm took office, in 2007, he allowed a research and policy group to examine the racial implications of his work. They found that he was prosecuting African-Americans more harshly than whites for nonviolent drug offenses. In response, Chisholm adopted policies that sharply restricted criminal prosecution for nonviolent drug offenses; this, of course, did away with most racial disparities in these areas. But violent crime remains concentrated in Milwaukee’s heavily African-American north side, and Chisholm has continued to prosecute those cases, in which both the defendants and the victims are overwhelmingly black. So there has been little change in the over-all ratio of black-to-white prosecutions.","2586","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-police-reform-look-like"
"There are other initiatives, too, that governments can undertake to address the deep hostility between African-American communities and police departments. Many have some value.

"In the last days of his life, Alberto Nisman could hardly wait to confront his enemies. On January 14th of this year, Nisman, a career prosecutor in Argentina, had made an electrifying accusation against the country’s President, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. He charged that she had orchestrated a secret plan to scuttle the investigation of the bloodiest terrorist attack in Argentina’s history: the 1994 suicide bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina, the country’s largest Jewish organization, in which eighty-five people were killed and more than three hundred wounded. Nisman, a vain, meticulous fifty-one-year-old with a zest for Buenos Aires’ gaudy night life, had pursued the case for a decade, travelling frequently to the United States to get help from intelligence officials and from aides on Capitol Hill. In 2006, he indicted seven officials from the government of Iran, including its former President and Foreign Minister, whom he accused of planning and directing the attack, along with a senior leader of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Months later, Nisman secured international arrest warrants for five officials, effectively preventing them from leaving Iran. As the case made him a celebrity, he invested in blue contact lenses and Botox injections. “Whenever he saw a camera, that was it, he would drop everything,” Roman Lejtman, a journalist who covered the investigation, said.","2590","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Over the years, the case, known by the Jewish organization’s acronym, amia, had exposed the flaws of Argentina’s judicial system. The presiding judge was indicted for trying to hijack its outcome, as were some of the country’s highest-ranked politicians. Iran’s leaders scoffed at Argentina’s demands to extradite the accused, and even issued a warrant for Nisman’s arrest. Nisman persevered, pressing the Iranians at every opportunity. From the beginning, he had the unstinting support of Argentina’s Presidents—first of Néstor Kirchner, who chose Nisman to supervise the prosecution in 2004, then of Cristina, who succeeded her husband in 2007. Every autumn, she travelled to New York and denounced the Iranian regime before the United Nations. Whenever Iran’s President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, entered the main hall to speak, Argentina’s diplomats, under Kirchner’s orders, walked out.","2591","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"And then, in early 2013, Kirchner, known for her erratic manner and ruthless political acumen, made an extraordinary about-face. Following months of clandestine negotiations, she struck a deal with the Iranian government that would, she said, finally break the deadlock over the amia case. The deal called for the establishment of a “truth commission” that would allow Argentine judges to travel to Tehran and possibly interview the suspects.","2592","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"While many Argentines applauded Kirchner’s diplomacy, Nisman told friends that she had betrayed him by making a deal with the Iranians. Secretly, he embarked on another investigation, of Kirchner herself. On January 14, 2015, Nisman released the results, accusing the President of engaging in a criminal conspiracy to bury the amia case. “The order to execute the crime came directly and personally from the President of the Nation,” he wrote. Amid a public outcry, Nisman was summoned to testify before the Argentine Congress. He told friends that he’d begun to fear for his life, but he was determined to see the case through. A few days before his scheduled appearance, he sent a text message to a friend: “On Monday I am going in strong with evidence!”","2593","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The night before Nisman was due in Congress, his body was found in his apartment, slumped against the bathroom door in a pool of blood. There was a bullet hole in his head and, on the floor next to his hand, a .22-calibre pistol and the casing from a bullet. In a trash can, police found a draft of a legal document, written by Nisman and never executed, clearing the way for Kirchner’s arrest.","2594","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Over the next few weeks, every Argentine seemed to have an opinion about how Nisman had died; the case became the Latin-American equivalent of the J.F.K. assassination, grist for conspiracy theories involving spies and foreign governments and conniving politicians. Posters across Buenos Aires asked, “Who killed Nisman?”","2595","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"During the investigation, Nisman had received many death threats, but his friends say that he bore them lightly. At one point, an Israeli writer named Gustavo Perednik met with Nisman in a Buenos Aires café to discuss what he should name the book he was completing about the amia case. Perednik passed Nisman a list of potential titles. He picked one immediately: “The Assassination of Alberto Nisman.” “Very catchy!” Nisman said.","2596","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"On the morning of July 18, 1994, a man driving a Renault utility truck loaded with several hundred pounds of ammonium nitrate and TNT pulled up to the building that housed AMIA and detonated his payload. The six-story structure collapsed, leaving behind a scene of corpses, severed limbs, and wailing victims. Rescue workers spent weeks searching the rubble for bodies and survivors.","2597","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The attack followed a nearly identical one two years earlier, in which a truck bomb exploded outside the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing twenty-nine people and wounding two hundred and forty-two. A wing of Hezbollah claimed responsibility, and many American officials believed that the Iranian regime had approved and helped carry out the attack. In the amia bombing, too, they suspected that Iran and Hezbollah, which often act together, were the main culprits.","2598","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The Argentine government began an investigation, but it soon stalled. The police recovered parts of the Renault truck—and then allowed them to sit in a warehouse. Three years into the investigation, James Bernazzani, a senior agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was dispatched to Buenos Aires to help. When he and his team began examining the truck, they found bits of flesh and bluejeans stuck to a fragment of metal. Technicians at an F.B.I. lab quickly identified a man who they believed was the driver: Ibrahim Hussein Berro, a Hezbollah operative from Lebanon. Intelligence analysts determined that Berro’s family had been fêted by Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, shortly after the bombing. “The case we made would have stood up in the U.S. judicial system,” Bernazzani said.","2599","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"But the Argentine prosecutors decided to focus instead on what they called the “local connection”: twenty-two Argentines, including a number of police officers who they said had assisted in the attack. At the center of the case was a member of a local stolen-car ring named Carlos Alberto Telleldin, whom they accused of selling the Renault to the bombers.","2600","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"At first, Telleldin claimed to have sold the truck to a man with a Central American accent, but he soon changed his story to implicate police officers from Buenos Aires Province. Not long afterward, a video surfaced that explained the reversal. The video, aired on national television, showed the judge in the case, Juan Galeano, paying Telleldin four hundred thousand dollars and instructing him to accuse the police. According to prosecutors, the country’s President, Carlos Menem, had endorsed the bribe, possibly in an effort to embarrass the governor of Buenos Aires, a political opponent. “In Argentina, large court cases are not about themselves,” Pablo Jacoby, a lawyer for a group of amia survivors and victims’ families, told me. “They are used by politicians to settle their differences.”","2601","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"As the case wound through Argentina’s labyrinthine judicial system, absurdities multiplied. A fireman admitted in court that he had lied about finding a piece of the truck which had actually been discovered by an Israeli investigator. A lawyer who worked on the case said that he had been tortured by Argentine intelligence agents and interrogated about tapes of Iranians involved in the plot. “Every aspect of the case was a disaster, beginning with the initial investigation,” Claudio Grossman, who was dispatched by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to observe the trial, said. (He is now the dean of American University Law School.) “Argentina is a modern country, but there is no trust in the legal system, no faith that the system can solve problems.”","2602","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In 2003, the prosecution finally collapsed, with a court finding all twenty-two defendants not guilty. Judge Galeano, Menem, and the head of the country’s main intelligence agency, side, were prosecuted. By the time the trial was over, it had compiled five hundred and eighty-eight volumes of evidence, heard twelve hundred and eighty-four witnesses, and lasted for nine years, making it the longest-running case in Argentine history. Néstor Kirchner, elected President that year, called the government’s handling of the case “a national disgrace.”","2603","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"A year later, Kirchner selected Nisman, then a junior prosecutor, to salvage what he could from the disastrous case and try again. Nisman was a surprising choice: he had been part of the team that led the initial amia prosecution, which carried on despite overwhelming evidence that the case had been corrupted. “I had lost respect for him,” Alejandro Rua, who worked on the prosecution, said. “He knew the case was bad, but he kept going.” Nisman’s friends saw it differently: as a junior lawyer, he had no choice but to go along.","2604","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Even as a young prosecutor, in the provincial city of Olivos, Nisman was smart and ambitious and unabashed about showing it. In the courtroom, he talked so fast that judges sometimes had trouble understanding him. He had started working in the judicial system at age seventeen, as an unpaid clerk, telling friends that one day he’d be attorney general. “We were the youngest people in the country doing the job then,” Fabiana León, a friend from those days, said. “Alberto did not like to lose, so he’d fight a lot with the judges, always objecting and making appeals.”","2605","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Two years after taking over the amia case, Nisman produced an indictment. In the course of eight hundred and one pages, he charged seven Iranian officials, including the former President, Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, and also indicted Hezbollah’s senior military commander, Imad Mugniyah. “The decision to carry out the attack was made not by a small splinter group of extremist Islamic officials,” Nisman wrote, but was “extensively discussed and ultimately adopted by a consensus of the highest representatives of the Iranian government.” Drawing on the testimony of Iranian defectors, Nisman wrote that the decision was made on August 14, 1993, at a meeting of the Committee for Special Operations, which included the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei.","2606","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Since the nineteen-eighties, Nisman wrote, Iran had established a “vast spy network” inside Argentina that gathered information, picked targets, and recruited local helpers. The coördinator of the amia operation inside the country was an Iranian named Mohsen Rabbani, who for many years was a leader at a mosque in Buenos Aires called Al Tawhid. It was Rabbani, Nisman said, who financed the attack, oversaw the purchase of the Renault, and directed the assembly of the bomb.","2607","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Nisman tracked the movements and telephone conversations of Rabbani and others in the days and hours leading up to the attack, showing that most of the plotters were talking to one another and to the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires. Nearly all of them left Argentina before the bombing, as did the Iranian Ambassadors to Argentina and several neighboring countries. But Rabbani stayed behind. He had recently been appointed a cultural attaché at the Iranian Embassy, and was thus the beneficiary of diplomatic immunity. Remarkably, he remained in Argentina for three more years, proclaiming his innocence, and was never taken into custody. In a statement after the bombing, Khamenei seemed to praise the attack: “By gathering together groups of Jews with records of murder, theft, wickedness, and hooliganism from throughout the world, the Zionist regime has created an entity under the name of the Israeli nation that only understands the logic of terror and crimes.”","2608","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Despite all the detail that Nisman gathered, the question of Iran’s motive was never definitively answered. Israeli officials believe that the bombing was meant to avenge an Israeli attack on a Hezbollah training camp in Lebanon a month earlier. But, according to Matthew Levitt, a former senior Treasury official and the author of a book on Hezbollah, planning for the amia operation began months before the Lebanon attack took place.","2609","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Much of the testimony that guided Nisman toward the Iranian regime was provided by a man referred to in court documents as “Witness C”—Abolghasem Mesbahi, an Iranian intelligence agent who defected to Germany in 1996. Mesbahi, too, was vague about Iran’s motivations. He told investigators only that the regime regarded Argentina, whose Jewish population is the seventh-largest in the world, as an easy place to kill Jews. But he offered one clear explanation for the vexed legal process that followed: President Menem, he claimed, was a paid Iranian asset of long standing.","2610","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"For years leading up to the attack, Middle Eastern countries had sought to expand their influence in Argentina. Menem’s predecessor, Raúl Alfonsín, had cultivated relationships with Egypt and Iraq, collaborating on a medium-range ballistic missile called the Condor. Alfonsín’s government had also agreed to provide material and technical assistance to Iran’s nuclear program, which was beginning to raise concerns in the West.","2611","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"According to Mesbahi, Menem began receiving large sums of money from Iranian agents in the mid-eighties, when he was the governor of La Rioja Province. Menem is of Syrian descent, and the payments, usually made to companies that he was connected with, were intended to buy influence in the country’s Middle Eastern community. According to a former senior member of his Administration, Menem also received millions of dollars from other governments, including those of Muammar Qaddafi, in Libya, and Hafez Assad, in Syria, to pay for his election campaigns.","2612","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Yet after Menem was elected President, in 1989, he halted arms deals with Libya and Syria and annulled the nuclear accord with Iran, according to Domingo Cavallo, his Foreign Minister. “The Americans told us, If you want to have a good relationship with us, cancel the agreement with the Iranians,” Cavallo explained. “So we did.” In Nisman’s telling, the cancellation of the nuclear agreement had prompted Iran to attack the amia center. He noted that, at the time, Iran was pressing Argentina to resume the agreement, but he offered little other evidence to support the allegation.","2613","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Mesbahi suggested that Menem’s clandestine relationship with Iran continued through the amia bombing. Under interrogation, he claimed that Menem had agreed to whitewash Iran’s role, and in exchange received ten million dollars, wired to his numbered account at the Bank of Luxembourg in Geneva. The money was paid from another Swiss account, controlled by Rafsanjani, the Iranian President. The F.B.I. agent Bernazzani argued that a formerly credible defector was peddling bad information. “Mesbahi was full of shit,” he said. Still, many American officials believe that Iran was involved in the bombing. Hezbollah would never carry out such an operation without Iran’s approval, they said. “The assumption was that the Iranians were involved, because the attack was carried out by a unit that they created,’’ Robert Baer, a former American intelligence official who tracked links between Hezbollah and Iran, said. “Mugniyah never did anything without the green light of the Supreme Leader.”","2614","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In 2007, Interpol’s general assembly endorsed Nisman’s indictment and issued “red notices” for five Iranian officials, calling on member states to arrest them. Interpol declined to issue warrants for the former Iranian President, Foreign Minister, and Ambassador—not because the proof did not merit them but because the agency’s bylaws prevent it from pursuing national leaders.","2615","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In the years that Nisman presided over the amia investigation, he became a famous man. Separated from his wife, he was a fixture at Buenos Aires’ night clubs and sometimes appeared in gossip magazines with various girlfriends. He relished his image as a lone prosecutor going after terrorists in the Middle East. With a large staff and a big budget, he cultivated relationships with American intelligence analysts, conservative think-tank experts, and the staff of Senator Marco Rubio, who kept track of his work. He rented a luxury apartment in the chic neighborhood of Puerto Madero and indulged a passion for windsurfing. Claudio Rabinovitch, a co-worker and a friend since high school, recalled, “He told me, ‘Claudio, we are fifty years old, and it’s time to enjoy our lives!’ ”","2616","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Yet Nisman remained intensely committed to his work and to his daughters, Iara and Kala, talking to them on the phone several times a day. After his father died, in 2004, he began to stay home from the office on Yom Kippur. It was a rare break. According to friends, the amia case had become a fixation: year after year, despite the lack of progress, Nisman kept searching for ways to hold the Iranians accountable. “Sometimes he would call me at two in the morning and tell me to be at the office at sunrise,” Diego Lagomarsino, a computer technician who worked for him, said. “Nothing Alberto did was surprising.”","2617","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Nisman seemed to carry all the case’s complexities in his head. “It was unbelievable how he remembered every detail, precise dates and facts,” Rabinovitch said. In his home and office, nothing was out of place. Papers were stacked at tidy right angles; not a trace of dust could be seen anywhere. In a country famous for steak and wine, Nisman ate rice crackers and barely touched alcohol. He went to lunch several times a week at Itamae, a sushi restaurant around the corner from his apartment—always the same meal, eaten with chopsticks held together by a rubber band.","2618","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"As Nisman assembled his case, he cultivated a friendship with Jaime Stiuso, a senior official at side. Stiuso, then in his late fifties, was a shadowy figure; he’d joined the agency in the nineteen-seventies, when side was heavily involved in repression and torture. In the years since, he’d almost never shown himself in public. But, according to Juan Martín Mena, a highly placed Argentine intelligence official, “Stiuso was the dominant force in the agency.”","2619","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Nisman also got assistance from the United States. According to diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks, American officials gave him guidance, helped him draft legal briefs, and lobbied foreign governments to support him. Between 2006 and 2010, Nisman met with U.S. Embassy officials more than ten times, at least once to speak with a senior official from the F.B.I. On one occasion, Nisman apologized for not telling the Embassy in advance that he had recommended Menem’s arrest. It’s unclear to what extent Nisman received help from American intelligence officers, but his visits to the Embassy fuelled speculation in the Argentine press that he was a puppet, dutifully following American and Israeli orders.","2620","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Despite the many death threats he received—in phone calls, letters, and e-mails, many of them directed at his daughters—Nisman believed that his connections in side would keep him safe. The Argentine government gave him a round-the-clock team of bodyguards. Nisman often dispatched them to run errands, leaving himself unprotected.","2621","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"For years, Nisman had no greater supporter than Cristina Kirchner. Every September, when she travelled to New York for the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations, she brought a group of amia survivors with her. In 2011, she told the assembly, “I am demanding, on the basis of the requirements of Argentine justice, that the Islamic Republic of Iran submit to the legal authority and in particular allow for those who have been accused of some level of participation in the amia attack to be brought to justice.”","2622","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Kirchner and her husband had long presented themselves as the moral censors of the country, leading an unprecedented effort to confront Argentina’s history of political violence. From 1976 until 1983, during a period dubbed the Dirty War, military dictators carried out a brutal campaign against suspected guerrillas and their sympathizers. The purge swept up students, professors, newspaper editors, and priests and nuns. Suspects were kidnapped, interrogated, and tortured, and many were flown over the Río de la Plata and thrown into the water. In this way, as many as thirty thousand Argentines were “disappeared.”","2623","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The military regime collapsed in 1983, following Argentina’s humiliating defeat in the Falklands War, but for decades the country’s civilian leaders largely refrained from investigating the crimes of the past. Each week, the mothers of people who had been disappeared gathered in front of the Presidential palace in silent protest. After Néstor Kirchner was elected, in 2003, he walked into the Naval Military College and demanded that portraits of the military leaders in the lobby be removed. On another occasion, standing before an assembly of officers, he announced, “I want to make it clear, as President of this nation, I am not afraid of you.” Some of the generals walked out. In 2005, Kirchner supported the repeal of two amnesty laws, and he instructed prosecutors to begin investigating.","2624","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Néstor and Cristina were young, colorful, and smart; former law-school sweethearts, they prompted comparison to Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2007, Néstor announced that he would stand aside to allow Cristina, then a senator, to run for President. After taking office, Cristina presided over the convictions of hundreds of officers for murder and torture. “What Néstor began, Cristina continued,” Raúl Zaffaroni, a former justice of the supreme court, told me.","2625","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Kirchner proved to be a dramatic and polarizing leader. “Fear God,” she said at a cabinet meeting in 2012, “and a little bit me.” According to local lore, while Néstor was President, he got into a heated argument with one of his ministers during a dinner at the official residence, prompting the minister to storm out. When Néstor chased the minister in a golf cart and coaxed him back to the table, Cristina ordered him out again, saying, “He who stands up once from my table will never sit with us again.”","2626","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In confidential cables released by WikiLeaks, American diplomats noted Kirchner’s “aggressive demeanor” and her apparent obsession with her looks. She reportedly spent “thousands of dollars every year on the latest fashion and having silicone injections in her face and hair extensions to make her appear younger.” The media gave her the nickname Botox Queen, and Kirchner sometimes played along, telling interviewers, “I was born in makeup.” In 2012, she displayed a surgical scar in a press conference and explained, “You know how I can be with aesthetics”—a play on a Spanish term for plastic surgery. “Politics before aesthetics.”","2627","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Néstor had taken office in the middle of an economic collapse, with more than half of all Argentines living in poverty. He chose an unorthodox strategy, emphasizing growth, even at the price of inflation, a devalued currency, and the risk of another collapse. Cristina kept up his efforts, nationalizing the country’s main airline and a large oil and gas company and seizing control of billions of dollars in private pension funds. She spent heavily on the problems of the poor, initiating a universal child-benefit plan and increasing pension payments for the elderly. Most notably, she continued her husband’s aggressive approach to Argentina’s debt, which amounted to nearly a hundred billion dollars. After laborious negotiations, a majority of bondholders agreed to accept a buyout of about thirty-three cents on the dollar.","2628","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In the view of many economists, this program carried the risk of crippling economic problems, forcing Argentina to make deals with China to bolster its foreign reserves. “Kirchner’s strategy has been a series of short-term fixes, none of which is sustainable,” Arturo Porzecanski, a professor of economics at American University, told me. “The model is nearing exhaustion.” A number of bondholders, mostly American hedge funds, continue to insist that they should be repaid in full. Kirchner has refused, referring to them as “vultures,” and the dispute has led to some extraordinary moments. In 2012, an Argentine naval vessel was seized at a Ghanaian port on one creditor’s request; the ship was released by a court order. The next year, Kirchner hired a private jet for a weeklong tour of Asia—at a cost of eight hundred and eighty thousand dollars—for fear that creditors would seize the Presidential plane.","2629","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Kirchner has prompted growing comparisons to Hugo Chávez, the populist and authoritarian President of Venezuela from 1999 until his death, in 2013. Indeed, both Kirchners grew dependent on Chávez, especially after Venezuela purchased seven billion dollars’ worth of Argentine debt as the country was emerging from its economic crisis. Venezuelan money may have been instrumental in Cristina Kirchner’s election. In 2007, Argentine customs officers scanning luggage from a chartered jet from Caracas found eight hundred thousand dollars stuffed in a suitcase. Its owner, Guido Antonini Wilson, told the F.B.I. that the cash was part of a Chávez-directed effort to finance Kirchner’s campaign.","2630","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Cristina Kirchner visited Chávez in Caracas and voiced support for his maverick foreign policy, warming to authoritarian states like China, Russia, and Cuba. Kirchner has at times blamed the United States for her country’s problems, describing it as a “hegemonic world power.” Last year, after an American court issued an unfavorable ruling regarding Argentina’s foreign debt, Kirchner seemed to allude to her own assassination. “If something happens to me,” she said, “look north.”","2631","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Over time, Kirchner has grown more dictatorial and, according to muckraking reports, more corrupt. The Clarin media empire, her greatest antagonist, has published a series of compelling (if not error-free) stories about the Kirchners’ dealings with businessmen, as well as the spectacular increase in their personal wealth during their time in office. After a series of confrontations with the press, Kirchner began to deprive some media institutions of state advertising. In 2009, she introduced “reform” legislation that seemed tailored to dismantle Clarin. “She is trying to destroy us,” Martín Etchevers, Clarin’s communications director, told me. Under Néstor Kirchner, a prosecutor named Manuel Garrido was appointed to investigate corruption in the Argentine government. When Cristina curbed his powers, he resigned in protest. He later told the Wall Street Journal that the scandals around Kirchner “mirror the emergence of crony capitalism, oligarchs who rose during the past decade through their ties to government officials.”","2632","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"One matter on which Kirchner appeared steadfast was the amia bombing. But, after Néstor died, in 2010, and she won a landslide reëlection the next year, her stance shifted. When Kirchner travelled to the United Nations that year, she responded favorably to an Iranian offer to “investigate” the amia bombing. When Ahmadinejad rose to speak, Argentina’s delegates remained in their seats. And for the first time in years the survivors of the bombing stayed home.","2633","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"On January 27, 2013, Kirchner announced that she had struck an agreement with Iran to set up the truth commission. The agreement did not call for a trial of the Iranian suspects, and none of its findings would be binding. Still, Kirchner called the agreement “historic,” saying that it would help to finally resolve the case. On Twitter, she wrote, “We will never again let the amia tragedy be used as a chess piece in the game of foreign geopolitical interests.”","2634","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The agreement with Iran was negotiated by Héctor Timerman, Kirchner’s Foreign Minister. Timerman is a paradoxical figure in Argentine public life: a Jew who describes himself as a “non-Zionist” and a sharp critic of the United States who lived for a decade in New York. Like many of Argentina’s leading political figures, Timerman was shaped by his experience in the Dirty War. He is the son of Jacobo Timerman, a prominent newspaper editor, who was detained in 1977 and tortured in a secret prison; his account of the ordeal, “Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number,” was an international best-seller. With his father in jail, Héctor Timerman fled to New York, where he lived in the West Village and helped found the human-rights organization Americas Watch. In 1989, he returned to Argentina to work as a journalist. In 2004, he came back to New York as part of Argentina’s delegation to the U.N., and in 2007 he went to Washington as Ambassador.","2635","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Timerman told me that he negotiated with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, in a series of secret meetings; over three months, beginning in September, 2012, they met in Zurich and Addis Ababa. He said that they faced an intractable legal problem. The Iranian constitution prohibits extraditing criminal suspects, and the Argentine constitution prohibits trying the Iranians in absentia. With no hope of resolving the case through standard legal channels, Timerman wanted to find some way of holding the perpetrators accountable. The truth commission would at least allow Argentine judges to go to Tehran and possibly interview the suspects. “We were going to tell them, ‘These are the charges against you,’ ” Timerman said. “You can’t go to the end of the trial, but you can start it.”","2636","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The agreement created a national uproar. Some Argentine Jews accused Kirchner of surrendering to the Iranians; many objected to the term “truth commission,” which suggested that the perpetrators of the attack were unknown. (Even Timerman conceded that it was a “terrible name.”) Doubts arose about Timerman’s explanation, especially his contention that he had been talking to the Iranians for only a few months. Nisman declared that the agreement represented an “unconstitutional” intrusion by the President into the judiciary and, in a televised interview, insisted that the Iranian suspects be brought to trial in Argentina, saying, “These crimes can be judged only where they happened.” In private, Nisman told friends that he suspected there was more to the deal with Iran than Kirchner was letting on. Recalling that time, his friend Fabiana León said, “Alberto is on fire.”","2637","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Shortly afterward, Nisman began investigating Kirchner and Timerman, with help from Stiuso, the senior intelligence official. He kept his activities secret, even from some people in his office. One person he confided in was Perednik, the Israeli writer. “He didn’t tell me all the details,” Perednik said. “But he was very excited. He said that by the time this was over Kirchner and Timerman were going to jail.”","2638","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"On January 12th, Nisman, on vacation in Europe with his daughter Kala, sent a text message to friends, saying that he was cutting his trip short and flying to Buenos Aires. “I have been preparing for this for a long time but I didn’t imagine it would happen so soon,” Nisman wrote. “I am putting a lot at stake with this. Everything, I would say.” He came back so abruptly that he left his teen-age daughter in the Madrid airport, waiting for her mother to pick her up.","2639","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Nisman didn’t say what he was planning—“Some may know what I am talking about, others may imagine”—but the implication must have been clear. A month before, Kirchner had peremptorily sacked three top intelligence officials, including Nisman’s ally Stiuso. Argentine Presidents are immune from prosecution while in office, but Kirchner’s term was due to end in a year. People speculated that she fired them to protect herself from an investigation. “Nisman thought he was next,” Fernando Oz, a journalist who spoke with Nisman regularly, said. “He thought if he waited any longer he wouldn’t have a job and he wouldn’t be able to accuse her.” His team would be disbanded, and he would have nothing to show for a decade of highly paid and highly publicized work.","2640","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In his messages to friends, Nisman wrote, “I know it won’t be easy. But earlier than late the truth prevails.” He signed off, “In case you’re having doubts, I’m not crazy or anything like that. Despite everything, I’m better than ever hahahahahaha.” On the morning of January 14th, just hours after his return, Nisman hand-delivered a two-hundred-and-eighty-nine-page report to a federal judge and made a sixty-page summary available to the media. He accused Kirchner and Timerman of “being authors and accomplices of an aggravated cover-up and obstruction of justice regarding the Iranians accused of the amia terrorist attack.” It was not an indictment but a call for further investigation. Among other things, Nisman wanted to interrogate the President.","2641","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The report’s central argument is that, in addition to the public agreement to set up a truth commission, there was a secret agreement, in which the Argentine government would remove the Iranian names from Interpol’s wanted list. In exchange, Argentina would benefit from lucrative agreements to sell grain and buy Iranian oil, or possibly to trade them. To make the deal acceptable to the public, Nisman said, Kirchner and Timerman planned to come up with a “new theory” of who committed the amia bombing.","2642","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The scenario closely aligned with one laid out four years earlier by the Argentine journalist Pepe Eliaschev, who had written that Timerman passed a message to Iran saying that Argentina was ready to “forget” the amia bombing, as well as the 1992 attack on the Embassy. Eliaschev claimed to have a copy of a memorandum that Iran’s Foreign Minister gave to President Ahmadinejad, saying, “Argentina is no longer interested in solving these two attacks, but instead prefers to improve economic relations with Iran.”","2643","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The Iranian government was a growing force in the region. According to former Venezuelan officials, Hugo Chávez introduced Ahmadinejad to leaders throughout Latin America. Among other things, Iran and Venezuela had established a weekly flight between Caracas and Tehran, and the two governments had set up a two-billion-dollar fund for investments in both countries. American officials say that Chávez also granted safe haven to operatives from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and from Hezbollah. In 2007, Chávez agreed to allow Iran and Hezbollah to use Venezuela as the base for a drug-trafficking and money-laundering network, according to a former American official who worked on narco-terrorism investigations. The official told me that the network netted the Iranians and Hezbollah as much as a billion dollars a year, with the Caracas-Tehran flights often being used to ferry drugs.","2644","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"As Cristina Kirchner solidified her relationship with Chávez, Argentina grew closer to Iran. During her first term, trade between the two countries doubled, with Iranians buying large quantities of Argentine grain. In early 2012, when the International Monetary Fund threatened to impose sanctions on Argentina for lying about its inflation rate, Héctor Timerman travelled to Washington to discuss the matter with the Obama Administration. According to an American official who was at the meeting, Timerman asked the White House to pressure the I.M.F. to rescind the warning. When the White House declined, the official recalled, Timerman mentioned the international effort to stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon and suggested that his government was considering taking Iran’s side. (Timerman denies making such a statement.) “When Héctor said that, you could have heard a pin drop in the room,” Dan Restrepo, an assistant national-security adviser at the time, told me.","2645","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In Nisman’s view, Kirchner and Timerman were so eager to strengthen their alliance with Iran that they were willing to sacrifice national sovereignty. “Let there be no doubt,” Nisman wrote. “The criminal plan consisted of eliminating the charges that the Argentine courts had filed against the Iranian officials, and the best means that was found to clear those charges, provide immunity and portray the matter in the tidiest possible manner to a deceived nation was to sign the aforementioned agreement.”","2646","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Nisman accused Kirchner of carrying out the scheme by a back channel involving civilians close to both governments. The heart of his accusation is a series of transcripts of recorded telephone conversations, many of which involve two Argentine activists, Luis D’Elía and Fernando Esteche. Both are fervent Kirchner supporters, have travelled repeatedly to Iran, and have led pro-Iranian demonstrations, in which they said that Iran was not responsible for the amia bombing. According to a Western diplomat in Buenos Aires, D’Elía—a former housing official in Néstor Kirchner’s government—is funded by the Iranian government.","2647","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In Nisman’s account, the two men—along with Andres Larroque, a member of the Argentine Congress—worked as Kirchner’s emissaries. Most of the wiretapped conversations feature them talking to Yussuf Khalil, a Lebanese-Argentine with ties to the Al Tawhid Mosque in Buenos Aires, where much of the attack on amia was said to have been coördinated. The mosque remains a gathering spot for anti-Israeli and pro-Iranian demonstrations; D’Elía and Esteche have both spoken there. According to Nisman, Khalil acted as an agent of the Iranian government and stayed in close touch with officials in Tehran.","2648","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Nisman’s report, evidently assembled in haste, is a rambling and sometimes maddening document. Although Nisman accused Kirchner of directing the secret deal and Timerman of carrying it out, there is no evidence tying either one of them directly to the alleged conspiracy. Most of the wiretapped conversations are cryptic and could be interpreted in ways that are not necessarily incriminating. Still, the accretion of detail and circumstance suggests that the men were discussing some kind of deal designed to lead to the removal of the Iranians from Interpol’s wanted list.","2649","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The most mysterious figure in the transcripts is someone known only as Allan; according to Nisman, he is Ramón Allan Héctor Bogado, an intelligence agent who works directly for Kirchner. (Mena, the senior intelligence official, told me that there is no record of Bogado’s ever having been employed by side. But an Argentine news Web site later published a statement from someone claiming to be Bogado, who said that he had worked for the agency as an “inorganic,” an agent who works off the books.) In February, 2013, a month after the Argentine government announced the agreement for the truth commission, Bogado talked with Khalil, the presumed Iranian operative. “I have gossip,” Bogado said. “I was told there at the house Interpol will lift our friends’ arrest warrants.” Khalil responded, “Thank goodness!”","2650","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"“Don’t worry,” Bogado says in another conversation with Khalil. “All this has been agreed to at the very top.”","2651","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In a transcript from that May, D’Elía tells Khalil that he is acting on orders from the “boss woman,” and that the Argentine government was preparing to send the two of them, along with a contingent from the national oil company, to Iran in order “to do some deals there.” D’Elía had apparently just met Julio de Vido, the Minister of Planning. “He’s very interested in exchanging what they have there for grains and beef,” D’Elía says.","2652","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The proposed trade deals were evidently linked to the Iranian parliament’s ratification of the public pact, which is commonly referred to as the “memorandum.” D’Elía suggests that this is a source of trouble. “There’s a political problem,” he says. “They need the memorandum to be approved, right?”","2653","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"“Yes,” Khalil responds. “This subject is quite clear.”","2654","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In conversations recorded before the public pact was announced, some of the men in the transcripts seem to have inside knowledge of the negotiations. In December, 2012, a month before the announcement, Esteche told Khalil that Kirchner’s government intended to invent a culprit for the bombing. “They want to construct a new enemy of the amia, someone new to be responsible,” he said. “They aren’t going to be able to say it was the Israelis,” he continued. Instead, the blame would be placed on a “group of local fascists.”","2655","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Bogado said much the same thing, months after the agreement between Iran and Argentina was signed: “There is going to be another theory with other evidence.” Bogado seemed to suggest that Nisman, despite his commitment to pursuing the Iranians, would be marginalized: “He’ll be twisting in the wind.”","2656","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"President Kirchner works in an ornate mansion in central Buenos Aires known as “the Pink House”—for the tint of its walls, once supplied by horse blood—but her official residence, in a northern suburb, is called Quinta de Olivos. Dating to the sixteenth century, Olivos, as it is known, is a white three-storied palace that resembles an enormous wedding cake.","2657","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"When I met Kirchner there, two months after Nisman died, the mystery was still dominating the news. I was ushered into a wide split-level room that had been set up as a television studio. Kirchner entered a few minutes later, in a flouncy dress and heavy makeup, followed by two dozen aides, nearly all of them men. With the cameras running, Kirchner reached over, before the interview began, to fix my hair. “Is there some girl who can help him with his hair?” she asked. “We want you to be pretty.” Then she began to straighten her own. “I want to primp myself a bit,” she said. “Excuse me, I’m a woman, besides being the President: the dress, the image—”","2658","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"“Divine!” one of her aides called from off the set.","2659","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Once we started talking, Kirchner turned serious, deriding Nisman’s accusation that she had made a secret deal to forget the amia attack; she called it “ridiculous,” “not serious,” and an “indictment without any kind of evidence.”","2660","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Kirchner told me that she believed Iran was probably involved in the attack, and that she had always insisted that the regime turn over the suspects. But after twenty-one years it was clear that the Iranians were never going to do that. “They never answered anything,” Kirchner said. “We were at a dead end.” She said that setting up the truth commission could allow an Argentine judge to question the Iranian suspects, and she described it as an important achievement: “We succeeded in persuading Iran to agree to have a discussion about the amia issue when they had refused it for decades.”","2661","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Members of Kirchner’s government have unanimously rejected Nisman’s accusations; the cabinet chief, Jorge Capitanich, called them “absurd, illogical, irrational.” Timerman denied making a secret deal and claimed that he doesn’t even know the people listed in the complaint. “Who is this Khalil?” he said. “Why doesn’t someone go and find him?”","2662","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Soon after Iran and Argentina signed their public agreement, Interpol released a statement saying that the arrest warrants would remain in place. The Iranian parliament declined to ratify the deal. Khalil, in the transcripts, seemed enraged. He told D’Elía that he had met with “the highest authorities” in Iran and added, apparently referring to Timerman, “I think that Russian shit screwed up.”","2663","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"For Nisman, the implication was clear: Timerman had promised that the notices would be lifted and when they were not the Iranians backed out. In his report, he notes that Salehi, the Foreign Minister, alluded to a secret agreement after the public one was signed. “The content of the agreement between Iran and Argentina in connection with the amia incident will be made public at the right time, and the matter of the accused Iranians is a part of it,” he said.","2664","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"What went wrong? Nisman believed that Timerman was planning to ask Interpol to lift the red notices. But Ron Noble, the head of Interpol at the time, told me that Timerman had asked on several occasions for the notices to be left in place. In any case, if Timerman had wanted the notices voided he would have needed an Argentine judge to dismiss the related charges. Noble pointed out that Interpol couldn’t act until those charges were dropped. Kirchner, too, emphasized that the disposition of the red notices wasn’t in her hands. “I could have publicly signed for the Iranians here in front of the whole world,” she said, “and it has no value.”","2665","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Then what were Khalil and the others talking about? Timerman told me that it’s possible they believed that the red notices would be lifted but were themselves playing no part in it. He suggested that they were just opportunists trying to capitalize on the warming relations between the two countries. “Maybe they were hoping they would get some business deals,” he said.","2666","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"But this doesn’t explain their apparent conversations with officials in both governments, many of whom expressed advance knowledge of the deal. And it doesn’t explain a series of public statements about the agreement, which make up some of Nisman’s most intriguing evidence. His report points out that, in one of the final paragraphs of the pact, Timerman and Salehi agreed to a cryptic clause: “The agreement, upon its signature, will be jointly sent by both ministries to the Secretary General of Interpol as a fulfillment of Interpol requirements regarding this case.” That sentence is ambiguous, but it suggests that both countries expected some action from Interpol. The Iranian regime announced its expectation clearly. After the pact was ratified, the government-sponsored news agency issued a statement: “According to the agreement signed by both countries, Interpol must lift the red notices against the Iranian authorities.”","2667","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"After Nisman filed his report with the federal judge, he visited Patricia Bullrich, a member of Congress and a leader of the opposition. As they discussed the allegations, Bullrich began to fear that Nisman was heading alone into a political hurricane. “He was going to be destroyed by the President,” she told me. Bullrich, the chair of the Criminal Legislation Committee, suggested a hearing, thinking that publicity would give him some protection. She told me that Nisman had left her office in high spirits, eager for a fight.","2668","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Word about the hearing spread quickly to Kirchner’s supporters. Diani Conti, a congresswoman from Kirchner’s party, said that she looked forward to confronting Nisman: “We’ve sharpened our knives.” Nisman spent his last days getting ready, and, at least outwardly, he was excited, nervous, and focussed. On Saturday evening, Waldo Wolff, a leader in Argentina’s Jewish community, sent a text: “How are you doing? What are you doing?” Nisman sent back a photo of a table filled with files and highlighter pens. “What do you think I’m doing?” he wrote. Claudio Rabinovitch, Nisman’s co-worker, saw him earlier that day. He told Nisman he was thinking about leaving his job, because he’d felt excluded from the secret investigation. Nisman, he said, refused to consider it. “Monday is the biggest day of my life,” he said.","2669","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"At about four-thirty on Saturday afternoon, Nisman asked Diego Lagomarsino, his computer technician, to come over. When he arrived, Nisman told him that the reaction to his report was more intense than he’d anticipated. “I’m afraid to go out on the street,” he said; he had sent his mother to shop for groceries. Then he asked Lagomarsino, “Do you have a gun?”","2670","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Lagomarsino said he did, and Nisman asked to borrow it. Lagomarsino told me, “I got scared—I was shocked.” His gun, he told Nisman, was old and small, not worth bothering with. Nisman said he didn’t trust his bodyguards to protect him.","2671","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Lagomarsino said that Nisman began talking about his family and grew more upset. “Do you know what it’s like when your daughters don’t want to be with you because they’re afraid something might happen to them?” Nisman said. Lagomarsino told me, “I had never seen him like this.”","2672","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Nisman again asked Lagomarsino to bring him a gun. “I only need it to scare someone off,” he said. “If I’m in the car with the girls and a crazy guy with a stick comes up and says, ‘You traitor son of a bitch,’ I can shoot in the air and scare him away.”","2673","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Reluctantly, Lagomarsino said, he got the gun and brought it back. It was an old Bersa, .22 calibre, a gift from his uncle. Lagomarsino said he showed Nisman how to load the pistol, how to hold it, how to squeeze the trigger. Nisman agreed that it was not really up to the job of protecting him. “Next week, we’ll go buy a new one,” he said. Nisman took the pistol, wrapped in a green cloth, and told Lagomarsino that he could leave. Pointing at his files, he said, “I have to get back to this.”","2674","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"I asked Lagomarsino if he had been worried that Nisman might kill himself. “No, no, no. Alberto? Never,” Lagomarsino said. “I was worried he was going to kill someone else.”","2675","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"At about twelve-thirty on the afternoon of Sunday, January 18th, one of Nisman’s bodyguards called his phone and got no answer. The bodyguard grew increasingly concerned. After he knocked on the apartment door, with no response, he called Nisman’s mother, Sara Garfunkel. Nearly ten hours after the bodyguard called Nisman, Garfunkel and another bodyguard entered his apartment with the help of a locksmith. They found Nisman on the floor of the bathroom, with a bullet in his head and Lagomarsino’s pistol next to his hand. He’d written up a shopping list. He was wearing a T-shirt and shorts. An autopsy determined that Nisman had killed himself and that no one else had been in the apartment when he died. He’d left no note.","2676","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Two hours later, Damian Pachter, a journalist for the Buenos Aires Herald, wrote on Twitter that Nisman had been found in a pool of blood, not breathing. Four days later, Pachter noticed that his tweet had been quoted by the Web site for Télam*, the state-controlled media agency—but that it had been altered, to read that Nisman had been found dead. “Maybe it was because I hadn’t slept, but I got really scared,” he said.","2677","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"An old source advised Pachter to leave Buenos Aires and meet him in his home town, several hours outside the city. Pachter arrived before dawn and found a coffee shop that was open. While he waited for his source to meet him, he said, a man wearing sunglasses sat down next to him. Several hours passed, and the man sat quietly, ordering nothing. Finally, Pachter said, his source arrived and took a photo of the man. Pachter said, “That’s when I knew I had to get out of there.” He went immediately to a travel agency and bought a plane ticket to Israel, where he holds citizenship. While waiting for a connecting flight, he checked his e-mail. A newspaper editor in Israel had written to tell him that a copy of his plane ticket had been posted on the Twitter account of Kirchner’s office.","2678","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Pachter has not returned to Argentina, saying that he fears for his life. He said he doesn’t know for certain why he was being followed or why someone in Kirchner’s office had posted his flight details. Pachter believes that Nisman was murdered, and that some element of the Argentine state was probably involved. He thinks that after Nisman was shot the killers moved his body and then altered the scene to eliminate traces of their work. “I think when I tweeted they were working on something, improvising the crime scene,” he said.","2679","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In the weeks after Nisman’s death, Argentina boiled with conspiracy theories—blaming the C.I.A., Mossad, even British intelligence. Kirchner, on her Web site, endorsed the autopsy’s findings, saying that it was a “suicide.” Her allies insinuated that Nisman, faced with justifying a case he’d created out of thin air, had suffered a crisis of confidence.","2680","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Since the end of the Dirty War, one of the animating ideas of Argentine public life is that politics should not be lethal. As a popular saying has it, “The blood never reaches the river.” Even so, Argentina has a continuing history of “suicides” that have turned out to be political murders. In 2007, Héctor Febres, a naval officer accused of torturing pregnant women—suspected guerrilla sympathizers—and, after they gave birth, murdering them and turning their babies over to military families, was found dead in his prison cell of cyanide poisoning. His death was ruled a suicide, but many Argentines believe that he was either killed or forced to commit suicide by his former comrades in order to prevent him from informing on others.","2681","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Three days after Kirchner declared Nisman’s death a suicide, she reversed herself, saying that he had been murdered—in a plot to discredit her. “They used him while he was alive and then they needed him dead,” she wrote on her Web site, under the headline “The suicide (that I am convinced) was not suicide.” She didn’t say who “they” were, but a few days later Kirchner suggested that it was her own intelligence agency, side, and that therefore she would disband it and form another. The intelligence agency, she said, has “not served the interests of the country.”","2682","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"It’s possible that Nisman succumbed to some private torment unknown to even those closest to him. Viviana Fein, a prosecutor charged with investigating Nisman’s death, left open the possibility that he could have been pressured into suicide—if, say, his daughters were being threatened. But among Nisman’s friends and professional acquaintances I could find no one who believed that he would shoot himself. “Alberto? Never,” León, his longtime friend, said. “He had fantastic self-esteem, and he really loved his children.”","2683","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Even after declaring Nisman’s death a murder, Kirchner allowed no sympathy for him. At a press conference, she suggested that he and Lagomarsino were lovers. She said that, as many had now suspected, she had fired the chiefs of side because they had opposed her agreement with Iran. Many Argentines did not believe her proclamations of innocence. In a nationwide poll commissioned the week after Nisman’s death, seventy per cent of those surveyed believed that he had been murdered, and half said they believed that the government was involved.","2684","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Basic facts about Nisman’s death remain unexplained. No gunpowder residue was found on his hand, as is typical of self-inflicted gunshots. His fingerprints were found on the pistol, but not those of Lagomarsino, who had just lent him the gun. A few days after the death, the police said that they had discovered a third entrance to Nisman’s apartment: a corridor for an air-conditioner that connects to a neighbor’s apartment; there they found an unidentified footprint. Police checked a camera mounted in the service elevator, and it was broken. In the stairwell, there were no cameras at all.","2685","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Evidence accumulated that the investigation into Nisman’s death had been so sloppy as to be fatally compromised. A woman summoned off the street to witness the crime-scene investigation (as required by Argentine law) described a partylike atmosphere. “They drank tea, ate croissants,” she said. “They touched everything. There were, like, fifty people in the apartment.” Police photos, provided to me by an Argentine journalist, show a group of police, without gloves, picking through Nisman’s belongings.","2686","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Nisman’s former wife, Sandra Arroyo Salgado, a powerful judge, denounced the investigation and engaged a leading forensics team to review the autopsy results. The team concluded that no muscular spasm had taken place in his right hand, as would have been normal if he had fired a gun, and that, in all likelihood, his body had been moved. (A police photo shows what are purported to be bloodstains on Nisman’s bed, suggesting that his body had indeed been moved.) According to the forensics team’s written report, which the newspaper La Nación obtained, stains in the bathroom sink had been scrubbed away, and the position of the gun was inconsistent with Nisman’s having shot himself. The most likely scenario, the report said, was that Nisman had been shot, while kneeling, in the rear-right of his head, and that he died in “agony.” At a press conference that Salgado held to announce the findings, she said, “His death is an assassination that demands a response from the country’s institutions.”","2687","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"On February 18th, a month after Nisman’s death, tens of thousands of Argentines gathered to remember him and to protest what they described as the government’s failure to protect a prosecutor. In pouring rain, the demonstrators walked silently from the Argentine Congress to the Plaza de Mayo, in front of the building where Kirchner works. Many carried placards. One read, “You can’t suicide us all.” Kirchner accused the marchers of playing politics and stayed home. The next day, she celebrated her birthday. “In the Chinese horoscope,” she wrote on Twitter, “I am a snake.”","2688","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"During my interview with Kirchner, she seemed unnerved by talking about Nisman’s death. When I raised the question of whether she’d had him killed, she blurted, “No!,” and then handed me a printout of the statement that she’d written for her Web site. She seemed mostly disturbed by the damage that Nisman’s death was doing to her reputation—which, she suggested, only strengthened the case that she hadn’t been involved. “Tell me, who has suffered the most with the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman? You tell me, Sherlock Holmes.” When I suggested it was she—that half the country believed she was involved in Nisman’s death—she nodded. “Exactly. This is one of the keys.”","2689","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"This view is widespread in Argentina, at least among Kirchner’s supporters. “Nisman’s case wasn’t that strong,” José Manuel Ugarte, a professor of law at the University of Buenos Aires, told me. “Kirchner would have survived it. I think the people who did this are people who wanted to destroy her government.”","2690","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Much of the early suspicion focussed on Jaime Stiuso, the senior official in side. Juan Martín Mena, whom Kirchner appointed to help lead the newly created intelligence agency, portrayed Stiuso as the leader of a rogue faction that was running a smuggling network. He said that senior members of side had a history of selling sensitive information to private buyers and of using such information to coerce results from reluctant judges.","2691","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Prosecutors say that on the last afternoon of Nisman’s life he tried repeatedly to call Stiuso, without success. They summoned Stiuso to answer questions and face embezzlement charges, but he vanished. One acquaintance of his said that he had fled to Uruguay; Kirchner thought that he was hiding in the United States.","2692","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Mena said that he did not believe that Nisman was involved in Stiuso’s illegal activities. So why did Nisman and Stiuso decide to work together against Kirchner’s outreach to Iran? Mena told me that, in their desire to keep the amia investigation going, the two men “followed foreign interests.” Which foreign interests? “The United States and Israel,” he said. “One hundred per cent.”","2693","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In the days before Nisman died, he believed that the Iranians were coming for him. When he met Bullrich, the congresswoman, he told her that he had overheard wiretapped conversations of Argentine military-intelligence officers saying they had passed his personal information to agents of Iran—on orders from Kirchner. Nisman said the Iranians knew “about him, about the investigation, with details about his family, about his daughters, about all the movements of his daughters.”","2694","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Since the Islamic Revolution, the Iranian regime has maintained an aggressive assassination program. The regime has been accused of murdering at least eighteen people living outside Iran, most of them Iranian dissidents. The most notorious murders took place in 1992, when Iranian agents gunned down four Kurdish exiles at a Greek restaurant in Berlin. In that case, German prosecutors had pursued Iranian officials relentlessly, much as Nisman did.","2695","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Yet no one in the Iranian regime seemed especially troubled by Nisman’s public allegations. And even if the regime wanted him dead why wait until after he gave his complaint to a federal judge? Many Argentines I talked with wondered whether he could have uncovered some other secret that caused someone in the Iranian—or the Argentine—government to kill him.","2696","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"By the time Kirchner announced the agreement about the amia case, Nisman’s obsession with Iran had expanded beyond Argentina. That year, he and his staff produced a five-hundred-page report outlining what it said was Hezbollah’s and Iran’s terrorist “infiltration” in Latin America. (A U.S. official called the report “spot on.”) A month before Nisman died, he told the writer Gustavo Perednik that he believed Argentina and Iran could be secretly discussing renewing the nuclear agreement of the nineteen-eighties and nineties. “Nisman said this was part of the big deal,” Perednik told me.","2697","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In January, 2007, according to a former senior official in Chávez’s government, Ahmadinejad visited Caracas and asked Chávez to intercede with the Kirchners. The official, who attended the meeting, said that Ahmadinejad wanted access to Argentine nuclear technology. (The official is one of several who are coöperating with American investigators, building a case against Venezuela for helping smuggle drugs for Iran and Hezbollah.) Ahmadinejad didn’t specify what sort of technology he wanted. But the Iranian reactor in Arak, still under construction, uses similar technology to an Argentine reactor at Atucha. Both are heavy-water reactors capable of producing plutonium, which can be used in nuclear weapons. “Brother, I need a favor,” Ahmadinejad told Chávez, according to the official. “What it costs in terms of money, we will cover.”","2698","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"“I’ll take care of it,” Chávez replied. Ahmadinejad also asked Chávez to persuade the Argentines to remove the Iranian names from the Interpol list. Chávez agreed to try.","2699","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"The former Venezuelan official said that he did not know whether Chávez—or either of the Kirchners—acted on the request or, if so, what the Kirchners got in return. But Stiuso apparently shared Nisman’s suspicion that the deal was in process. He told Pablo Jacoby, the lawyer for the amia victims, that he was trying to make sure Argentina didn’t provide assistance to Iran’s nuclear program. “The real issue has always been the transfer of nuclear technology,” Jacoby said. “Stiuso told me he didn’t want the Iranians to get the bomb.”","2700","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"In the months after Nisman’s death, his family asked to be left alone to grieve, so during his funeral, at the Jewish cemetery in the Buenos Aires suburb of La Tablada, hundreds of mourners gathered outside the gates. Some carried signs that said “We are all Nisman” or “No more corruption and impunity.” Others held Argentine flags or simply stood in silence. Inside, the Jewish community leader Waldo Wolff noted in a eulogy that Nisman’s death had revealed the inner workings of Argentine political power, which had failed to provide justice to the victims of the amia bombing for more than twenty years. “Alberto’s death, and the macabre plot around his death,” Wolff told the mourners, “came to remove the debris around the amia building, allowing us to see what actually lies underneath them: the dark labyrinth of power hidden in the most open parts of our society.”","2701","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"As the weeks passed, the truth seemed as elusive as ever. A succession of judges, most of them loyal to Kirchner, dismissed Nisman’s complaint. Kirchner, though politically damaged, carried on. Jacoby told me that, with Nisman gone, the amia investigation—so complex, so divisive, so old—would probably die, too. “There is no replacement for Alberto,” Jacoby said. “The whole case is in his head.”","2702","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"
"Suicide or murder? Jacoby said that that was the wrong question: “Now, even if the truth is that he committed suicide, nobody will ever believe it.” By Jewish tradition, people who kill themselves are sometimes denied a proper burial; in the cemetery in La Tablada, suicides have been relegated to a far corner. After some discussion, Nisman’s body was buried not with those who killed themselves but with the victims of the amia attack. ♦","2703","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/death-of-a-prosecutor"

"It was an unseasonably warm night in Chicago. On Tuesday, November 4, 2008, nearly a quarter of a million people—young and old, men and women of almost every racial and ethnic background—streamed into Grant Park. The crowd was peaceful and somewhat subdued, filled with a jittery anticipation about how the night would likely unfold. Shortly after 10 P.M. Central Standard Time, television networks announced that Barack Obama had been elected the forty-fourth President of the United States. For a few seconds, the crowd stood still, in a stunned silence. Then, the crowd let out a collective and euphoric scream. There was joy, relief, and disbelief. Tears flowed freely, strangers hugged for several minutes, others knelt and prayed. Senator John McCain’s concession speech put Obama’s election into its historic context by reminding Americans that just a century ago President Theodore Roosevelt had been vilified for inviting Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House. Obama’s victory speech took the high-spirited crowd even higher: “If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.” I called my cousin, who was too filled with emotion and too mystified to complete her thought: “This country . . . This country . . . This country . . . ” she said quietly, as her voice trailed off.","September 23, 2015","2705","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"If Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic nomination and the national election, can we expect the same gathering of crowds and the same emotional outpouring? Would the historic election of the first woman President evoke a similar thrill and sense of wonderment at the leaps that this country is capable of making?","2706","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Probably not. But why not? Is the election of a black man more revolutionary than the election of a white woman? Of course, one cannot compare the moment of an election victory of one candidate to a moment during another candidate’s campaign, a year before the election. And much of the excitement about Obama derived from the dissatisfaction with the President he was replacing. But the question remains: what’s behind the shortfall of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton?","2707","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"There are myriad reasons, and Clinton, of course, is not remotely as inspiring a speaker or campaigner as Obama. But another obvious explanation is the persistent problem of gender bias in American culture. Perhaps the sexism—in both overtly hostile and less visible but still insidious ways—has helped stoke the fires of animosity towards Clinton while, at the same time, creating an almost impossible standard for her. Unlike her male opponents, Clinton has to be far more careful and measured in what she says and does. To be free from a strict choreography of words and actions is a form of male privilege that Hillary Clinton cannot access.","2708","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Authenticity has been a keyword during this election season. And our culture, suffused with sexism, plays the role of the arbiter of a candidate’s authenticity. Clinton must tread lightly: she cannot appear too strong without risking her likability ratings; she cannot appear too vulnerable without her credibility suffering. Herein lies Clinton’s dilemma. The Clinton campaign declared recently that Hillary would show more of what the New York Times called “humor and heart,” so she learned a popular dance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and appeared on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” Clinton may “play the Granny card” to appear less ambitious and more friendly and family-focussed. It is hard to imagine that a man would have to do the same.","2709","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"On a more visceral level, some Americans still wince at the idea of a woman in the Oval Office. When it comes to sexism in American culture, very little has changed since the 2008 election. Indeed, things may have gotten worse. Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has continued to thrive after making unseemly comments about Fox News host Megyn Kelly and his opponent Carly Fiorina. The conservative political blog RedState maligned Clinton as proof that “even a homely woman can sleep her way into power.” Bill Maher’s suggestions for infusing some spirit into Clinton’s “joyless” campaign were not as vicious, but they were belittling nonetheless: “See if Taylor Swift has room in her girl gang for you. . . . Lick a donut with Ariana Grande. . . . Start a Twitter war with Katy Perry and then delete your tweets.” Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s opponent, summed it up: “I don’t know that a man would be treated the same way that Hillary is.” He added, “Some of it is sexist.”","2710","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Clinton, who is regularly ribbed for her signature pants suits, has tried to defuse another issue that hounds her—her age. Recall that in 2007, when Hillary had just turned sixty, Matt Drudge printed an A.P. photo of Clinton looking fatigued, and Rush Limbaugh asked his audience, “Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?” On Tuesday, RedState ran a piece titled simply, “Hillary: sick, elderly crook.” Degrading comments about Clinton’s age represent the most unadulterated form of sexism levelled against her. In a culture obsessed with youth, fresh-faced femininity is valued while “older” women (who may be as young as fifty) are made to feel invisible. Tira Harpaz, writing for the blog Feministing, quipped that women “have a sell by date and after that we’re pretty disposable.” In an attempt to get out ahead of the age issue, Hillary joked that she will not go gray in office as most male Presidents do, since she has been coloring her hair for years. Male candidates need not worry about coloring their hair or “growing old gracefully.”(Jeffrey Frank wrote about this today, in the context of Dwight Eisenhower’s reëlection.)","2711","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Some of the concerns about Clinton are very personal, but even these have an element of sexism in them. Many Americans, for example, feel a pointed disaffection for her. She faces what pundits call a likability problem. Voters perceive her as competent and hardworking, but not warm. A recent series of psychology studies by Princeton professor Susan Fiske showed that women who present traditionally feminine traits (stay-at-home moms, for example) are viewed as warm, but not competent, and are treated dismissively. Women considered less traditionally feminine (including lesbians, athletes, feminists, and working women) are not thought of as warm, but are perceived to be competent, and face a more antagonistic form of sexism. Women, unlike men, are rarely perceived as warm and competent, which, as Fiske explains, puts them in a “catch-22 situation.”","2712","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"So what should Hillary do? This Sunday, on “Face the Nation,” she was asked to offer three words describing herself. She responded, “I mean, look, I am a real person with all the pluses and minuses that go along with being that. And I’ve been in the public eye for so long that I think, you know, it’s like the feature that you see in some magazines sometimes, ‘Real people actually go shopping,’ you know?” She was mocked, but maybe she shouldn’t have been. Perhaps the “real” Hillary Clinton is the woman who said, in a “60 Minutes” interview in 1992, when Gennifer Flowers alleged that she had had a romantic relationship with Bill Clinton, “I’m not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.” Perhaps the “authentic” Hillary Clinton is also the woman who famously snapped, “I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession.” And maybe the “real” Hillary Clinton also tears up when she talks about her mother’s difficult childhood, her grief over her mother’s death, and her longing to have her mother by her side now. Why can’t she be all those things?","2713","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"And why can’t we be inspired by her? Clinton famously declared “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” when she spoke at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing, in 1995. In 1997, as First Lady, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides health care to more than eight million children and has reduced the number of uninsured children by half. After September 11th, as a New York senator, Clinton helped to secure funding to track the health of first responders, and she has worked to expand health benefits for members of the National Guard, the Reserves, and their families. As Secretary of State, she helped open the United States’ relations with Cuba and negotiate sanctions against Iran. She also oversaw the diplomatic response to the Arab Spring. Clinton has championed children’s causes since she was the First Lady of Arkansas, and she has a long history with the Children’s Defense Fund.","2714","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-arent-we-inspired-by-hillary-clinton"
"Our culture is stubborn; it changes at a glacial pace. If we look at Hillary Clinton from another angle, the enthusiasm gap is less remarkable than we thought. Perhaps it is the expected response to a complex woman who has a long and tangled history in politics. Perhaps the ambivalence toward Hillary Clinton is evidence that we still have a long way to go before we openly accept a woman who spills over the strict parameters and rigid boundaries that our culture constructs. If Hillary Clinton wins, she will become the first woman President, and her victory will be a transformative moment in our nation’s history.

Eight years ago, Hillary Clinton was dominating the young upstart from Illinois in the Democratic primaries.

He was down in the polls, his donors were complaining, and, hard as it is to believe now, he was even losing to Clinton among African-Americans.","October 13, 2015","2716","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"

"Dan Pfeiffer, then the campaign’s deputy communications director, told me, “It’s crazy to think now, but the big narrative was whether Obama was tough enough to take on Clinton and whether he was black enough to win the African-American vote.

"How did the Obama team turn it around? The conventional wisdom is that he inspired voters with an uplifting message and out-organized Clinton in Iowa and elsewhere.

"The kill-Hillary strategy began with an October memo that was written by several top Obama officials, including Axelrod, Grisolano, Pfeiffer, the campaign manager David Plouffe, and Joel Benenson, Obama’s pollster. “Joel Benenson was a key contributor to how we stack up against her message-wise,” Grisolano said.","2721","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"I’ve previously reported on aspects of the memo, but the entire document is being published here for the first time.

"The memo was used to set up a crucial meeting to plot Obama’s fall strategy, which included a debate in Philadelphia and the Iowa Democratic Party’s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, traditionally one of the most important events in the run-up to the caucuses. Obama and his aides met in a Chicago office building on October 11, 2007. “The memo was written for a big Come-to-Jesus meeting, at which Obama wanted us to review the strategy and lay out our plans,” Axelrod said, adding that Obama “wanted to talk brass tacks about where we were going” and “we had a rigorous discussion around the points in the memo.”","2723","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"

"The only way for Obama to win this argument about change was for him to raise the character issue, which he had tiptoed around until that point in the campaign. Benenson’s polling showed that voters wanted a President “who can unite the country and restore our sense of common purpose,” “stand up to lobbyists,” and “who doesn’t just tell people what they want to hear.” The strategists, addressing Obama, wrote that these qualities “are the ones on which YOU scores high and Hillary, low.” They concluded, “Barack Obama is change. She is not.”","2725","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"The next section was headlined, “The Fault Line: Hillary’s the Problem, Not the Answer,” and the strategists laid out the case against Clinton in stark terms, explaining that everything in Obama’s campaign, including his slogan—“Change you can believe in”—was meant to provide a contrast with Hillary, not on policy, but on character:","2726","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"The memo went on to criticize Clinton as “a prescription for more of the same, meaning that our shared goals will once again be frustrated by Washington’s failed politics,” and it included a grid—“The Basic Messaging Framework”—to highlight the differences that Obama needed to emphasize:","2727","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"Attacking Clinton as “driven by politics, not conviction” and arguing that she “puts preserving political power ahead of reliable principles or progress for the American people” was a tricky for Obama. After all, if he represented a new way of doing politics, he couldn’t sound like a traditional politician on the attack.","2728","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"“Frequently, in campaigns, when we say ‘contrast,’ it’s a euphemism for a frontal attack,” Grisolano explained. “You can see in the memo, and this is important about the constraints that the message put on us, because if you are the unity guy you can’t come out with a crowbar against your opponent. We had to show we were different, but do it in a way that wasn’t as direct as most campaigns do.”","2729","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"In the memo, Obama was counselled to attack Clinton subtly but not “so subtly or obtusely that the press doesn’t write about them and the voters don’t understand that we’re talking about HRC.” Obama agreed with the strategy. “One thing I recall was that he was willing to draw contrasts with Hillary but was very intent on doing it in ways with which he felt comfortable,” Axelrod told me.","2730","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"
"Another former senior Obama adviser argued that the same vulnerabilities that the Obama team seized upon still exist and are just waiting to be exploited by Bernie Sanders or Martin O’Malley or her other opponents. “Her greatest vulnerability in this primary is on shifting positions,” the former senior adviser said, adding that her recent announcement to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she previously supported, was a mistake. “Her decision on T.P.P. is a fairly significant error. She is going to get attacked either way, so she might as well get attacked while having a sincere position.”","2731","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"

"Could Obama’s 2007 strategy work in 2015? The Obama strategists I talked to were skeptical. “The conventional wisdom is that Hillary is in deep trouble and that Biden is ready to ride to the rescue of the Party,” Axelrod said. “I just don’t see it. I said a month ago that I thought her stock was greatly undervalued, and I would buy it now. I still feel that way.”","2733","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-to-beat-hillary-clinton"

"Last week was a good one for Hillary Clinton. It started with her appearance on “Saturday Night Live.” Kate McKinnon did her customary Clinton impression, this time sitting in a bar, trying to forget about Donald Trump. Clinton played Val the bartender, who seemed to embody how the former Secretary of State would like to be seen: as a hardworking, wryly funny older friend, whose earned wisdom you can turn to at the end of a long day. They sang “Lean On Me,” and, after Clinton left, McKinnon pronounced, “She was real and smart and really nice in person!”","2736","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Two days later, the “Today” show found Clinton flipping pancakes for voters in New Hampshire. When she was asked yet again about her e-mail accounts, she dismissed the question and cited the extraordinarily impolitic boast made a few days earlier by the House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, who had told Fox’s Sean Hannity, “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today?” The Republicans were embarrassed, and Clinton benefitted. Last Thursday, McCarthy was forced to drop out of the race to succeed John Boehner as Speaker of the House.","2737","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Clinton is still scheduled to testify before the Benghazi committee a week after the first Democratic Presidential debate, which will be sponsored by CNN and held on October 13th, in Las Vegas. The Benghazi hearings would seem to have little credibility left, but both events will mark a new stage of the campaign for Clinton, one in which she will have to relinquish the tight control she has maintained over her appearances. At the debate, she will be joined onstage by Bernie Sanders, who has launched a strong challenge and is now favored by twenty-five per cent of likely Democratic voters, to her forty-two per cent, and by Martin O’Malley, Lincoln Chafee, and Jim Webb, all of whom are polling in the one-per-cent range. Vice-President Biden, because he is polling at around eighteen per cent, is eligible to take part, even if he declares at the last minute.","2738","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"Biden’s role has been a big open question. Another is why this first debate is so late in coming. The Republicans have already had two, each of which attracted more than twenty million television viewers, and will stage ten more. The Democratic National Committee has authorized only six. One is the Saturday night before Christmas; another is the Sunday night before Martin Luther King, Jr., Day—not times likely to attract large audiences. Given the concerns about the Presidency being passed between a couple of families, why set up a schedule that seems designed to squelch lesser-known candidates’ chances?","2739","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The lesser-knowns have objected, but Clinton doesn’t seem to mind. One reason for that might be gleaned by looking back to October 30, 2007, when the Democrats debated in Philadelphia. Clinton was the front-runner then, too, and it was the thirteenth time the candidates had met. But it was also, arguably, the first time that her opponents—Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, John Edwards, Christopher Dodd, Joe Biden, and, most improbably, Barack Obama—seriously challenged her, on all fronts. Edwards accused her of “doubletalk.” Obama called her out for “changing positions whenever it’s politically convenient”—she was “for NAFTA previously, now she’s against it”—and for not being “truthful.” A lot of the time was taken up asking why records of her official work in her husband’s White House were sealed in the Clinton Presidential library. She responded with what must have been intended as judiciousness but came across as obfuscation. When Tim Russert, one of the moderators, tried to determine whether she was in favor of issuing driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants—she had indicated both yes and no—she called his question a “gotcha.”","2740","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"In the days that followed, Clinton and her campaign tried to frame the debate as a Hillary-against-the-world moment, a “pile-on,” orchestrated by what she called, in a speech at Wellesley College, “the all-boys’ club.” Clinton had been considered the winner in most of the previous debates, and even many of her supporters acknowledged that this one marked a turning point. A week before, she was at 48.5 per cent in an average of polls, the highest she had ever been. (Obama registered 21.2.) Immediately afterward, she began a decline and, despite some rebounds, never matched that number again.","2741","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"From her perspective, there may have been something broken about the 2008 debates. A remarkable eighteen million people voted for her during the primary season, and she and her supporters may feel that a process that derailed her then is not one to follow now. But, if Clinton has concluded that the lesson of 2008 is to avoid debates, she does not yet understand why she lost that night in Philadelphia. Polls still show that a perception of dishonesty is her greatest problem among voters. (“They don’t trust you. They might not like you,” Savannah Guthrie told her last week.) Often, that perception is the product of unfair partisan attacks, but, as in 2008, it is also sometimes the result of her decisions. Last Wednesday, Clinton announced that she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that is a high priority for President Obama, even though she had praised the negotiations when she was Secretary of State (“the gold standard in trade agreements”) and referred to them proudly after she left office.","2742","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"The thinking appears to be that she’ll score points with Sanders voters and with organized labor, while Biden, as a loyal member of the Administration, will have to support the T.P.P.—a classic triangulation. But it echoes Obama’s nafta comment from the Philadelphia debate, just as the questions about her White House records now sound like a prelude to the e-mail issue. Fair or not, she needs to push herself to a greater level of openness, and figure out how to have a good week based on a real-world confrontation, not a comedy-sketch encounter. Clinton stayed in the 2008 race for eight months after her loss in Philadelphia. By the end, Barack Obama was a palpably stronger candidate. So, for that matter, was Hillary Clinton. A few weeks after Philadelphia, she had picked herself up and gone to the next debate, in Las Vegas—the site of this week’s meeting—where she performed well. The last question, from a young woman, was a “fun” one: “Do you prefer diamonds or pearls?” Clinton laughed. “Now, I know I’m sometimes accused of not being able to make a choice,” she said. Then she added, “I want both.” ♦","2743","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/october-surprises"
"I’ve already given my instant verdict on Tuesday night’s Democratic debate: in terms of the horse race, Hillary Clinton was the clear winner, although Bernie Sanders also did pretty well. But it was a long discussion about serious issues, and some of the exchanges bear closer inspection—including the one about Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who is currently languishing in Russia.","October 14, 2015","2744","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"The exchange began with host Anderson Cooper asking Lincoln Chafee, a former governor of Rhode Island, “Governor Chafee: Edward Snowden, is he a traitor or a hero?” Chafee replied that he would bring Snowden home without forcing him to serve any jail time. “The American government was acting illegally,” he continued. “That’s what the federal courts have said; what Snowden did showed that the American government was acting illegally for the Fourth Amendment. So I would bring him home.”","2745","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Chafee was stating a truth. In May of this year, a three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, ruled that the N.S.A., in routinely collecting the phone records of millions of Americans—an intelligence program that Snowden exposed in 2013—broke the law of the land. The Patriot Act did not authorize the government to gather calling records in bulk, the judges said. “Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans,” the decision read. The ruling overturned one that had been handed down in December, 2013, in which a federal judge, William Pauley, said that the N.S.A.’s collection of metadata was legal.","2746","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"After Chafee spoke, Cooper turned to Hillary Clinton and asked, “Secretary Clinton, hero or traitor?” Clinton, who earlier in the debate had described herself as “a progressive who likes to get things done,” replied, “He broke the laws of the United States. He could have been a whistle-blower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistle-blower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that.”","2747","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"“Should he do jail time?” Cooper asked, to which Clinton replied, “In addition—in addition, he stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands. So I don’t think he should be brought home without facing the music.”","2748","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"From a civil-liberties perspective—and a factual perspective—Clinton’s answers were disturbing enough that they warrant parsing.","2749","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Did Snowden break the law? In passing classified information to reporters, he did. The Espionage Act explicitly prohibits such actions. But this violation surely needs to be balanced against the public service that Snowden carried out in informing the American public about the extent to which their government had been spying on them. “I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined,” Bernie Sanders pointed out, immediately after Clinton spoke. “He did—he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that. But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration.”","2750","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Evidently, Clinton disagrees. In saying that Snowden should have invoked “all of the protections of being a whistle-blower,” she was repeating an argument that President Obama has made. But it doesn’t withstand inspection. The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, which provided legal immunity to government employers who reveal lawbreaking, malfeasance, or abuse of authority, doesn’t apply to employees of the intelligence agencies, including contractors like Snowden. These workers are covered by the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act; but, as, Michael German, a senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, pointed out, in 2013, “it is no more than a trap.”","2751","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"German explained that the 1998 act set up a procedure for employees of the intelligence agencies to report wrongdoing to Congress via the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General. But the legislation didn’t fully protect whistle-blowers from internal reprisals or subsequent prosecutions. “Reporting internally through the ICWPA only identifies the whistleblowers, leaving them vulnerable to retaliation,” he noted. “The examples of former NSA official Thomas Drake, former House Intelligence Committee staffer Diane Roark and former CIA officer Sabrina De Sousa show [this] too well.” (In 2011, my colleague Jane Mayer wrote a long piece about Drake, who was charged under the Espionage Act.)","2752","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Finally, what about Clinton’s claim that some of the information Snowden took from the N.S.A. has “fallen into a lot of wrong hands”? The assertion echoed a report, published in June by the Sunday Times, which quoted anonymous officials in the British government who said that Russia and China had decrypted some of the files taken by Snowden, prompting MI6, the U.K.’s foreign-intelligence service, to pull agents out of several countries. At this stage, though, there has been absolutely no confirmation of this allegation, nor even that Russia or China obtained any of the classified material that Snowden accumulated. Snowden has said that he destroyed all of the documents he had in his possession before departing Hong Kong for Moscow. In an article querying the Sunday Times story, the Guardian’s Ewen MacAskill, one of the reporters who worked on the original Snowden revelations, wrote that it may reflect “a cack-handed attempt by some within the British security apparatus to try to take control of the narrative.”","2753","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"That sounds about right, and it’s not clear why Clinton would want to associate herself with such an effort. Moreover, as Glenn Greenwald, another journalist who worked with Snowden, pointed out on Twitter: “It is ironic how Hillary used the same slimy innuendo against Snowden that’s been used for months about her emails.”","2754","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"So what was Clinton up to? Perhaps she is such a pillar of establishment thinking, and of the national-security state, that she really believes what she said. Perhaps she was just using Snowden to burnish her credentials as a hawk and appeal to the American public at large, which is rather less sympathetic to Snowden than most progressives are. (In a recent poll carried out by the digital-media company Morning Consult, fifty-three per cent of respondents said that they would support a government prosecution of Snowden, and just twenty-six per cent said they would oppose such an action.)","2755","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Ultimately, speculating about motives doesn’t get us very far. The fact is that Clinton said what she said, and she said it unapologetically, just as she did in telling Cooper that she didn’t regret voting for the Patriot Act. At least some Democratic voters—those who take seriously the right to privacy established under the Fourth Amendment—will have been listening.","2756","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden"
"Since Tuesday night’s Democratic debate was held in a Las Vegas hotel, let’s start with the money question: Who won and who lost?","October 14, 2015","2757","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Undoubtedly, Hillary Clinton was the biggest winner, partly because she was playing for the highest stakes. She flew into Nevada as a wounded favorite, whose stumbling performance during the past six months, much of it provoked by the issue of her personal e-mail server, had left many Democrats wondering whether she could get it together in time to win a nomination that was supposed to have been hers for the taking, let alone to win the general election. If she had come across as tetchy and defensive, as she has so often this year, or if she had committed an embarrassing verbal gaffe, the pressure on her would have increased still further, and the chances of Vice-President Joe Biden entering the race would have gone up.","2758","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Instead, Clinton delivered a performance that no doubt reminded establishment Democrats why they had rallied behind her in the first place, and reminded Republicans why she could prove to be a most formidable opponent come November, 2016. Sharp, personable, and assured, she batted off an early question from the moderator, Anderson Cooper, about her flip-flops on various issues, breezed through most of the subsequent exchanges, and received a big assist from her closest rival, Bernie Sanders, who, in perhaps the most memorable moment of the evening, declared, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails…. Enough of the e-mails. Let’s talk about the real issues facing America.”","2759","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Those comments earned the Vermont senator a warm handshake from Clinton and the biggest cheer of the night from a Democratic audience that was all too willing to believe her claim that the Republicans’ pursuit of the e-mail matter is a political vendetta. Even Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who in August said that the Republicans had raised legitimate issues about the e-mails, backed off, saying that he, too, was delighted to be discussing other issues.","2760","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Clinton, of course, would have been more than happy to talk about issues all night. As it became clear that none of the other candidates was going to take her down, she turned her fire on the Republicans, portraying them as dangerous extremists and saying, “They don’t mind having big government to interfere with a woman’s right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They’re fine with big government when it comes to that. I’m sick of it.” That line earned Clinton her biggest cheers of the night.","2761","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"The horse race apart, it was a substantive debate, with the candidates going into a level of detail that was rarely broached in the first two Republican debates. (Of course, there were many more candidates on stage at those events.) The matters raised ran the gamut, covering gun control, Syria, climate change, Black Lives Matter, Wall Street regulation, college funding, and paid leave for workers. On many of these issues, Clinton, Sanders, and O’Malley showed themselves to be in general agreement about what was needed, but also, in some cases, divided on how to achieve their shared goals.","2762","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"That much we knew going in. Still, it was instructive to watch Sanders say, in response to a question from Cooper about whether he considers himself a capitalist, “Do I consider myself part of the casino-capitalist process, by which so few have so much and so many have so little, by which Wall Street’s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don’t.” And it was equally instructive, moments later, when Clinton said, “Well, let me just follow up on that, Anderson, because, when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families.”","2763","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"On foreign policy, too, the differences between the two front-runners came through clearly, despite the respectful attitude they adopted toward each other. Defending the Obama Administration’s decision to provide military assistance to the Libyan rebels seeking to overthrow Muammar Qaddafi, Clinton described it as “smart power at its best.” Unlike Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, Sanders didn’t criticize the Libya decision, but he did express skepticism about U.S. military interventions generally, describing the Iraq invasion, which Clinton voted for, as “the worst foreign-policy blunder in the history of this country.” He also said that he opposed the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria, an idea that Clinton has supported.","2764","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"All in all, the seventy-four-year-old senator from Vermont gave a good account of himself. In one sense, indeed, he made history. Not since Eugene Debs has a self-avowed socialist made such an impression in a Presidential race, in terms of the language he has invoked, the support he has garnered, and the impact his rise has had on the other candidates. Sanders’s Brooklyn accent became more pronounced as the night went on, as he railed against the “oligawky” and denied having left anyone at the “altuh.” (The latter statement was in reference to his refusal to support a 2007 immigration bill.) Afterward, he said that he wished he’d had more time to talk about rising inequality and the challenges it presents to democracy. In reality, though, he got his message through. “Here is the truth that very few candidates will say,” he said in his closing statement. “Nobody up here—certainly no Republican—can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life.”","2765","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Of the second-string contenders, O’Malley fared by far the best. An articulate policy wonk, he held his own while debating the issues, and delivered the strongest closing statement, saying to those Americans who have become disillusioned about politics, “Talk to our young people under thirty, because you’ll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country.”","2766","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"By contrast, Webb and Lincoln Chafee, the former senator from Rhode Island, both looked and sounded terribly out of place. Webb started out by becoming possibly the first Democratic candidate in recent memory to boast of his service in the Reagan Administration (he worked in the Pentagon). Thereafter, he spent a lot of time grouching about how little time he was being allotted. Chafee stumbled badly in trying to explain why he voted, in 1999, to repeal the Glass–Steagall Act, which separated commercial banking from investment banking. Neither man looked like he would be around for long, though Webb did get off one good line: “Bernie, I don’t think the revolution’s going to come. And I don’t think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff.”","2767","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Clinton didn’t have the passion of Sanders or the poetry of O’Malley’s sign-off, but she had something else: the self-confidence and killer instinct of a politician who has been down this route before. Early on, before Sanders helped her out with his comment about her e-mails, she stuck it to him in his most vulnerable area: his record on gun control. She pointed out that he voted five times against the Brady Bill, which required a federal background check and a five-day waiting period for gun purchases. She also ridiculed his answer to a question from Cooper about why he had supported an immunity provision for the manufacturers of guns used to commit violent crimes. “It wasn’t that complicated to me,” Clinton said, after Sanders called the bill a complicated one. “It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity.”","2768","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"The Democratic front-runner also demonstrated the hawkish streak that infuriates some progressives and sometimes earns her grudging respect from Republicans. Asked about Edward Snowden, she repeated the discredited argument that he could have invoked whistle-blower status, and said that he had stolen a lot of information that had fallen into enemy hands. “So I don’t think he should be brought home without facing the music,” she concluded. (Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for President George W. Bush, tweeted, “Good for Hillary on Snowden.”)","2769","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"In her closing statement, Clinton said that she wanted to get back to “the basic bargain I was raised with: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.” That, of course, is an entirely familiar Democratic trope. When Bill Clinton was running for President, it was dubbed the “New Covenant.” President Obama often expressed it in terms of rewarding “hardworking folks” who “play by the rules.” In this case, though, familiarity is unlikely to breed contempt—at least among the moderate and loyal Democrats whom Clinton needs to support her. Bill Clinton and President Obama won four elections between them. For one night, at least, Hillary Clinton gave Democrats reason to believe that she might be ready to follow their example.","2770","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-wins-big-in-vegas"
"Fifteen years ago, as Philip Roth was reading the galleys of a memoir by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., he came to a passage about the political fevers of 1939-40, when reactionaries like Father Charles Coughlin, Henry Ford, and Charles Lindbergh brandished the twin banners of nativism and isolation. Moderate Republicans, including Wendell Willkie, a corporate lawyer who eventually won the Party’s Presidential nomination, were never likely to topple F.D.R., and some Party grandees wanted Lindbergh to run. Lindbergh was known by then not only as the daring aviator who crossed the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis but also as a bigot so vile that F.D.R., upon reading one of his speeches, remarked that “it could not have been better put if it had been written by Goebbels himself.”","2771","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Next to a passage where Schlesinger raised the question of whether Republicans would put Lindbergh forward at the head of a new Know-Nothing Party, Roth wrote, “What if they had?” That marginal note became the germ for “The Plot Against America,” a counter-factual novel in which Lindbergh is elected President. “Fear presides over these memories,” Roth’s novel begins, “perpetual fear.” Anyone who dares to look past the comedy of Donald Trump’s surreal tweets and Ben Carson’s end-times ruminations will notice that the politics of perpetual fear is, in our times, the stuff of nonfiction.","2772","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Last week, the Democrats held their first debate, a five-candidate affair in Las Vegas—an unlikely place to hear denunciations of “the casino-capitalist process.” Still, it was a relatively civil and sober discussion compared with the Republican rodeos. After a year of floundering, Hillary Clinton, cool, well-schooled, forensically skilled, had her best hours as a candidate. Her performance provided relief for her supporters and a potential lure for the undecided. She was, contrary to previous reports, conspicuously human-seeming—funny, passionate, even, at times, rueful of past mistakes—a development that might have robbed her potential rival, Vice-President Joe Biden, of the rationale he needed to make a run. Bernie Sanders, the seventy-four-year-old junior senator from Vermont and unapologetic democratic socialist, spoke in a voice that suggested Larry David, on “Seinfeld,” imitating George Steinbrenner. And yet although Clinton handily won the debate, Sanders largely set the terms, pushing her toward a more full-throated progressive view of income inequality and other issues. (From offstage, the Black Lives Matter movement had an equally serious influence on the discussion of race.)","2773","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Sanders also paused for an act of clever generosity, declaring, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails!” Beaming and extending her hand, Clinton thanked him but did not reciprocate the kindness, swatting him on his weak record on gun control, citing his multiple votes against the Brady bill. And while Clinton totted up her own list of Scandinavian-style domestic goals, such as paid parental leave, she raised a brow at Sanders when he talked of “revolution” and the systemic rot of late capitalism. In case we hadn’t figured it out, Hillary Clinton wants to win.","2774","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"History may look back on the Las Vegas debate as the event that elevated Clinton the way that Barack Obama’s eloquent victory speech after the Iowa caucuses elevated him, nearly eight years ago. It might even be regarded as the moment when she boxed out Biden, raked away the underbrush of Mssrs. Chafee, Webb, and O’Malley, and made Sanders look less like a plausible contender than like a protest candidate who forced his opponent to grapple with a political system poisoned by the outsized influence of an American oligarchy comprising, as the Times has reported, a hundred and fifty-eight families.","2775","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"One debate will not erase all of what many voters see as Clinton’s complications: the lingering perception of her sense of moneyed entitlement, her lawyerly slipperiness under questioning, the walled garden of her political circle, her interventionist reflexes, her belatedness on gay marriage, comprehensive immigration, and Wall Street reforms. But if Clinton was not flawless she and her debating partners managed one distinct achievement: they accentuated the chaos, the intellectual barrenness, and the general collapse of their rivals in the Republican Party.","2776","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider the political spectacle on Capitol Hill, in which Speaker John Boehner, hardly a Rockefeller Republican, could no longer deal with his caucus and, with little more than a chorus of “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah,” announced his early retirement. Members of the caucus stepped forward to admit that the hearings on Benghazi were aimed less at uncovering the truth than at burying Hillary Clinton. An ambitious Party loyalist, Paul Ryan, is reluctant to run for Boehner’s chair because the House Republicans are the new Wild Bunch and, as a friend of Ryan’s put it to Politico, “he’s not a f—ing moron.”","2777","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Consider, too, the G.O.P. candidates for the White House. Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the only Republicans polling in double digits, daily clear their throats with that ritual preface of modern self-satisfaction—“I am not politically correct”—and then unleash statements, positions, and postures so willfully detached from fact that they embarrass the political culture that harbors them. Trump is willing to say anything—anything racist, anything false, anything “funny”—to terrify voters, or rile them, or amuse them, depending on the moment. The worst of his demagogic arousals are reminiscent of Lindbergh’s speeches at America First rallies and his fear, as he wrote in Reader’s Digest, of a “pressing sea of Yellow, Black and Brown.” Carson, who seems as historically confused as he is surgically skilled, has said that Obamacare is worse than 9/11, “because 9/11 is an isolated incident.” What’s more, the two men’s rivals either fall into line or lack the persuasive powers and the courage to marginalize candidates they know to be dangerous.","2778","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"In electoral terms, Democrats had to view the week’s events with confidence. But there is pathos and foreboding here for the republic. In the debate, Clinton was clear who her enemies were: “the Republicans.” Reports of the death of the radical right are premature. In 2016, the G.O.P. is likely, at a minimum, to hold its majority in the House. If there is a campaign promise in 2016 that is almost sure to be fulfilled, it is that obstructionism and political war will continue, for within the G.O.P. the politics of perpetual fear goes on corroding not just a party but a nation. ♦","2779","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/stranger-than-fiction-a-turning-point-for-hillary-clinton"
"Hillary Clinton’s crucial misstep in the second Democratic debate, in Des Moines on Saturday, may have come about ten minutes in. The subject was Paris, which had been attacked the night before, with more than a hundred and twenty people dead. John Dickerson, the moderator, asked Clinton if the Obama Administration, in which Clinton served, had underestimated the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack. She answered by talking generally about the various means available to defeat the group, and then said, “But it cannot be an American fight. And I think what the President has consistently said—which I agree with—is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.” Then she repeated what sounded, intentionally or not, like a renunciation: “But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.”","November 15, 2015","2780","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“But Secretary Clinton, the question’s about what—was ISIS underestimated?” Dickerson said, trying again. This time, Clinton responded by saying, first, that “we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis, to leave”—which is true, but not really responsive—and then, after acknowledging that the situation had “developed,” added, “But I don’t think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility. I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.” There was a sensible point in there about not going in alone or pretending that America can solve everything. But Clinton had also laid out ammunition for her opponents, and the responses came from left, right, and center.","2781","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“John, I would—I would disagree with—with Secretary Clinton, respectfully, on this score,” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said, jumping in. “This actually is America’s fight.” O’Malley is not exactly what Donald Trump would call “a killer” (“No dollar too small,” he said in his closing statement, after reminding the audience of his Web site), but he knew an easy hit when he saw it. A few commercial breaks later, CBS’s “back soon” promotion was an abridged video of the exchange. It was one of those moments that will likely be clipped, repeated, and distorted beyond what Clinton deserves. (If only she’d slipped an “only” in there.) And yet, in a way, the stronger response came from Bernie Sanders, from another angle entirely.","2782","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“I think she said something like, ‘The bulk of the responsibility is not ours,’ ” Sanders said. “Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unravelled the region completely. And led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” Clinton voted to authorize that war; he voted against it. Dickerson asked, “Are you making a direct link between her vote for that and what’s happening now for ISIS?”","2783","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"“Oh, I don’t think any—I don’t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,” Sanders said.","2784","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"In other words, Clinton had managed, in a couple of sentences, to simultaneously open herself up to the charge that she sees ISIS as someone else’s war and that she rushes into wars too readily. Those notions feel paradoxical, and yet they both feed into a critique of Clinton as someone who does not always embrace responsibility. It did not help that she replied to Sanders not by acknowledging the specific disaster of Iraq but by saying that there had been big terrorist attacks before Iraq, too—under Reagan and “when my husband was President.” Perhaps “cannot be America’s fight” was an attempt to reassure non-interventionist primary voters, but she has favored more direct military involvement in Syria, and needs to better explain that she knows what the consequences might be, rather than occluding them. In that sense, the exchange touched on a fear that Clinton is not only hawkish but hawkish in a politically opportunistic way.","2785","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"There is, and will be, quite enough politicking in this race related to the dilemmas laid bare by Paris. On Saturday, Donald Trump was at a rally in Texas, talking about how what Paris needed was more guns and fewer immigrants. He was sorry about the plight of Syrian refugees, he said, but America would be “crazy” to take more. Jeb Bush gave an interview to Hugh Hewitt, the conservative talk-show host, in which he combined a bouncing eagerness to get on a war footing (“This is not a law-enforcement operation”) with a garbled call to arms (“This is an organized effort to destroy Western civilization, and we need to lead in this regard”). Rand Paul used Paris as a way of attacking Marco Rubio for being soft on immigration. Rubio released a video in which he explained that this is a “civilizational” fight rather than a “geopolitical” one, while sitting in a leather armchair in a shadowy space, as though the place for counterterrorism is and always will be an English gentlemen’s club. It can’t be helped; there is something about a crisis of this scale that makes politicians dream of Churchill.","2786","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"That was the backdrop when the Democrats took the stage, at 9 P.M. They began with a moment of silence for the victims in Paris; all three were suitably solemn. Then came a request from Dickerson for each candidate to give a minute-long opening statement, “to share your thoughts about the attacks on Paris and lay out your vision for America.” Sanders went first and said that the attacks had left him “shocked and disgusted.” Paris got one more sentence in his opening—“Leading the world, this country will rid the planet of this barbarous group called ISIS.” Then he went straight to inequality and money in politics, ending on one of his signature phrases: “A handful of billionaires.” There were pre-debate reports that the Sanders campaign was not happy with CBS’s plans to reshape the opening around Paris; the sense among commentators beforehand was that it would play to all of Clinton’s strengths.

"And, again, there was the contrast with Sanders’s theatricality: in a discussion about the limitations of the phrase “radical Islam,” Clinton got caught up in the fine print, in a way that will likely leave her open to out-of-context quoting. Sanders basically said that he wasn’t so interested in labels, and then immediately railed, with greater passion, against organizations like ISIS that think “we should go back several thousand years,” to a time when there wasn’t even a Brooklyn.","2788","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"Clinton’s answers on domestic policy were generally clearer, and more likely to serve her well in the general election—though here she was up against Sanders’s populism. (“It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids,” he said.) And yet it was in a discussion of a domestic issue that she gave what may have been her most discordant answer. Sanders had wondered why Wall Street figures and institutions would be among her biggest backers if they didn’t think they were getting something for their money—“I mean, you know, let’s not be naïve about it.” Clinton said that the answer was easy: “I represented New York on 9/11, when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan, where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”","2789","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"
"Wall Street the street is, indeed, in Lower Manhattan. But Wall Street the industry is all over town, and in other towns, too. Some financial institutions were devastated, and lost many people. But the idea that the guys in the neighborhood, whom she, particularly, helped to their feet after the terrorists attacked, had just passed the hat out of gratitude was Giuliani-level 9/11 political exploitation. It felt disingenuous. And, after a night that Paris spent under siege, it felt wrong.","2790","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/hillary-clinton-post-paris-debate-goes-wrong"

"The moment Hillary Clinton seemed to realize that her testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi was not going to be a big problem for her or for her campaign came about forty-five minutes in. When the hearing opened, she had regarded the chairman, Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, with irritated skepticism. She looked as if she might say something rash, if not throw something, and perhaps she might have. Nearly three years ago, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Benghazi, she lashed out after having been asked many times about U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice’s comments on the Sunday talk shows about what had instigated the attack, on September 11, 2012, in which four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the Ambassador to Libya, died. “What difference, at this point, does it make?” Clinton demanded. Out of context, she sounded unmoved by the men’s deaths. Now, in the House hearing, it seemed to dawn on her that the proper response to her Republican interrogators was not outrage but pity.","2857","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Peter Roskam, of Illinois, was laying out a scenario in which Clinton’s assumption of a leadership role on Libyan policy “didn’t come easy,” when he stopped and said, in case he might be overwhelming her, “I can pause while you’re reading your notes from your staff.” Clinton replied, “I can do more than one thing at a time, Congressman—thanks.” A minute or two later, Roskam said, “Go ahead and read the note if you need to.” This time, Clinton laughed. “I’m not done with my question,” Roskam said; he was just doing her a “courtesy.” “That’s all right,” Clinton responded, with a friendly wave of her hand. From then on, she was in control. “I’m sorry that doesn’t fit your narrative, Congressman. I can only tell you what the facts are,” she told Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who is the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. As he spoke, she rested her chin on the palm of one hand, as if he were not much more than a loud boor at a party who, puzzlingly, doesn’t seem to know how he sounds. When Lynn Westmoreland, of Georgia, informed her that he spoke slowly, Clinton laughed again and said, “I lived in Arkansas a long time. I don’t need an interpreter.”","2858","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"But in one sense she did need interpreters, and she got them. There was plenty of combat in the course of the hearings, but on Clinton’s side it was waged, for the most part, by the Democrats on the panel, who served as her anger translators. Elijah Cummings, of Maryland, repeatedly called out his Republican counterparts on conspiracy theories mooted and on inaccurate statements made, such as the charge that Clinton had personally turned down requests from Ambassador Stevens for more security. (“Four Pinocchios!”) Cummings, in his opening statement, asked why the committee existed at all. The answer that he suggested—“to drive down Secretary Clinton’s poll numbers”—seems almost a truism by now; indeed, it has been confirmed by a number of prominent Republicans in less guarded moments.","2859","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"There have now been seven full investigations of the circumstances surrounding the Benghazi attack, five in the House and two in the Senate. The Tampa Bay Times’s PolitiFact Web site noted recently that it was largely accurate to say that all the investigations found things that could have been done better (such as intelligence sharing) but none found “overt wrongdoing.” (Meanwhile, the Obama Administration’s larger Libya policy and its real failures have hardly been discussed.) Gowdy, whose defensiveness was palpable, said that his committee was better than the others: he has found more e-mails and more witnesses, even though they have led farther away from the burning compound in Benghazi.","2860","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"One such witness was Sidney Blumenthal, the writer and longtime Clinton friend. (He has worked for the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation and, in the nineteen-nineties, for The New Yorker.) Blumenthal sent Clinton a number of e-mails about Libya, some of which she passed on to others in the State Department. As a result, he was questioned by the committee, in a closed hearing, for almost nine hours, despite having no real knowledge of what unfolded in Benghazi; his name has become one that Clinton’s opponents obsessively allude to. “I honestly don’t understand this fixation,” Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said.","2861","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Gowdy’s rationale was essentially that the people in the State Department might have been as distracted by Blumenthal as he apparently is, and in a way that harmed national security. “It’s relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal’s drivel,” he said. (Gowdy was also bothered by the fact that one of Clinton’s aides, Huma Abedin, had sent her an e-mail about milk.) There is plenty to debate in Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server and the potentially overlapping interests of the State Department and the Clinton Foundation without lapsing into that sort of illogic. Any Americans who are not yet tired of hearing about Clinton’s e-mails may finally have had their fill. (As Representative Schiff said, “I feel like channelling Bernie Sanders.”)","2862","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"During this hearing, Clinton did convey that she saw Ambassador Stevens and the other Americans who died—Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty—as human beings. She spoke about sleepless nights spent worrying about diplomats’ safety and “racking my brain about what more could have been done.” Gowdy, speaking next, used his time to rail against Schiff, who, several minutes earlier, had called the hearing a “prosecution.” At one point, the proceedings turned into a shouting match between Gowdy and Cummings. Clinton straightened the papers on the table in front of her, pausing occasionally to contemplate Gowdy or to smile at Cummings. There were several more rounds of questions, in which her interrogators manifested all of Washington’s pathologies—dysfunction, partisan squabbling, insularity—in such extreme form that Clinton came across not only as a grownup, as her supporters had hoped, but as the most normal person in the room.","2863","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"
"Clinton has been immersed in politics for decades, and yet the panel managed to make the contrast between her manner and the ways of Washington look stark. She appeared to be a sensible outsider. At 7:15 P.M., nine hours after the hearings began, Martha Roby, of Alabama, asked Clinton about her movements when she went home on the night of the attack. “Were you alone?” she asked. Yes, Clinton said. “The whole night?” Clinton started to laugh once more. “I don’t see why that’s funny,” Roby said. Not funny, perhaps, but, like the Benghazi committee itself, absurd. ♦","2864","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/hillarys-moment-at-the-benghazi-hearing"

"On Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton went on the “The Tonight Show” to talk about, well, mostly Donald Trump. She first appeared in a skit in which the host, Jimmy Fallon, dressed as Trump, called her on the phone to catch up, offer campaign advice, and provide a set-up for her to discuss the many ways that she has fought for women’s rights throughout her long career in public service. Later, during the interview portion of her appearance, she and Fallon joked about Trump’s hair (she invited Fallon to touch hers) and mocked his stream-of-consciousness speaking style.","September 17, 2015","2871","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Noting that Trump and other Republican candidates have never held political office, Fallon asked Clinton, “Is this possible, that you have too much experience to become the President of the United States?” The questions did not get harder hitting from there. Are you tough enough to be President? How did you figure out how to use Twitter? Fallon tried to ask Clinton about the ongoing scandal involving the e-mails she sent as Secretary of State, but she parried the question by joking about gefilte fish, then offered a vague explanation about how various governmental agencies interact. Fallon, nodding, was ready to move on.","2872","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Fallon, as Trump might say, always wins in the ratings, and is a great big, huge, massive success on social media. Clinton was eager and a good sport, but if there was a viral moment I missed it.","2873","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"It could have been different. Clinton was reportedly offered a spot on Colbert’s first show, which aired last week, but her campaign team turned it down. (Perhaps they were worried that he would ask a coherent question about the e-mails; he probably would have.) So the invitation went to Jeb Bush, who, during an oddly paced conversation, earned from Colbert some lukewarm and circuitous praise. “There is a nonzero chance that I would consider voting for you,” Colbert said, causing Bush to pause for a moment, taken aback, perhaps thinking that the host had said “a zero chance.” But such scorn from Colbert was instead reserved for Trump, who is, despite the host’s antipathy, appearing on “The Late Show” next week, a day after Ted Cruz. Before that, on Friday, it will be Bernie Sanders, who earlier this summer went on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” There, Meyers began the interview by making fun of Sanders’s hair, but then, remembering perhaps that he is supposed to be the intelligent late-night alternative (or is that Colbert now?), led a substantive conversation about economic inequality.","2874","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"All of the candidates—including those among the herd of Republicans in the race, some of whom have started their own late-night tours—have the misfortune of campaigning to replace an all-star yakker, Barack Obama, who looks more comfortable on talk-show sets than at least half of the guys (yes, still all guys) currently behind the desks. In 2009, he became the first sitting President to appear on a late-night show, when he visited the “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.” This summer, he offered quasi-official Presidential goodbyes to the departing David Letterman and Jon Stewart. The 2016 candidates aren’t just running for President, but auditioning for the role of Guest-in-Chief.","2875","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"And this campaign arrives at a time when the hosts, too, are jockeying for position in a crowded field. Some see the booking scramble as a new iteration of the late-night wars, with Fallon and Colbert reëstablishing the old Leno-Letterman dynamic, in which Fallon, like Leno, wins the ratings, but Colbert, as was true of David Letterman, enjoys more cultural cachet. (This interpretation relegates “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to third-party status, and the others to the further fringe.)","2876","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"The emerging conventional wisdom suggests that if you want to behave like a grown-up, you’ll go on Colbert’s show, and if you want to make a dent on social media, you’ll go to Fallon and make yourself look gently ridiculous in exchange for a little viral gold dust. But, for politicians, it hasn’t worked out that way so far. Last week, Trump chose Fallon and faced off against the genial host’s Trump impression. (He seemed pleased at what he saw.) When Fallon asked him how he would create new jobs as President, Trump replied, “I’m just going to do it.” (Same thing with the border wall.) At the end of the bit, Trump blew Fallon a kiss. The exchange did not make waves.","2877","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Trump might have made more of a splash on Jimmy Kimmel’s show, which, like Fallon’s, produces reliably shareable moments, but with a touch more vinegar thrown in. Watching Trump read mean tweets about himself could have been fun for all. Then again, the invitation might not be forthcoming: Kimmel doesn’t seem to like Trump much. (An even better, but sadly impossible, match for Trump: the short-lived but sensation-making “Morton Downey Jr. Show,” which ran for a couple years in the late nineteen-eighties, and where Trump could have traded insults with the vituperative host, mocked his fellow-guests, and basked in the madhouse frenzy stirred up by the braying audience.)","2878","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Remarkably, the most viral late-night moment for any politician during this cycle was a long, wide-ranging conversation about authenticity and grief. When Vice-President Joe Biden went on Colbert last week, they talked about how religious faith has shaped the way that they both have faced personal tragedy, and the discussion was raw and unsettling and poignant. No one quite knew how to put this politely, but it was political gold. Colbert, visibly moved, more or less demanded that Biden run for President—if he does, these several minutes on television will be cited, rightly or wrongly, as a turning point. They were also a reminder that Internet virality is not always a reflection of our most shallow selves. Sometimes people share things for the simple reason that they mean a great deal.","2879","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"Watching Clinton on Fallon, Wednesday night, I was reminded of just how many times Clinton has, while running for office, strained to come across as an ordinary person. No amount of self-deprecating quips about dyeing her hair or wearing pantsuits, or jokes about being a kooky grandma, will make the case. She is not ordinary, but rather an exceptional person with an exceptionally complicated public history. That doesn’t mean that she can’t connect with people, though, even in the constricting genre of late-night TV. She was always funny on Letterman, but during an appearance in 2003 she was more than that, talking about how she felt in the days after her husband admitted to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky. She was there to promote her book, but everyone goes on late night for a reason. She had profound things to say about marriage, pain, and forgiveness. Viewers have come to expect a politician’s appearance on a talk show to be frivolous and opportunistic. When it is more than that, they are surprised and sometimes even moved. Humanizing yourself, after all, is a different thing from showing your humanity.","2880","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-presidential-campaign-and-the-new-late-night-wars"
"The contrast couldn’t have been more stark. On Friday, as Hillary Clinton was basking in the reaction to her marathon appearance before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, her communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters that the hour between nine and ten o’clock on Thursday night, after the hearing finally finished, was the campaign’s best fund-raising hour yet. And also on Friday, A.F.S.C.M.E., the largest public-sector union in the country, announced that it was endorsing Clinton for the Presidency—an important win in her tussle with Senator Bernie Sanders for the backing of organized labor.","October 25, 2015","2881","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Meanwhile, the campaign of the supposed Republican front-runner, Jeb Bush, was letting it be known that it was laying off people and slashing its payroll by forty per cent. It’s well known that the Bush campaign has been spending heavily, and there have been persistent rumors that, with the candidate trailing badly in the polls, its fund-raising efforts had stalled. Evidently, these rumors were accurate. Seeking to put a positive spin on things, the Bush campaign portrayed the cost-cutting as an effort to play the long game and direct resources toward the early primary states—Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. “This is about winning the race,” a Bush adviser told Bloomberg Politics. “We’re doing it now and making the shifts with confidence. We expect to win.”","2882","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Campaign advisers have to make such statements. But many people in the G.O.P. are losing confidence in Bush. A new poll from Iowa, which was released on Thursday, showed the former Florida governor garnering just five per cent of the votes among likely Republican voters. Perhaps the poll, from Quinnipiac University, was an outlier? No, it wasn’t. On Friday, another Iowa survey, this one carried out by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics, also showed Bush at just five per cent. “By any honest analysis, the first ten months of this year have been a political disaster,” a senior Republican told the Times, adding that it was “an unbelievable position to be twisted into, from ‘shock and awe’ to ‘aw, shucks.’ ”","2883","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Why is the Republican pre-race favorite doing so much worse than the Democratic favorite?","2884","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The obvious answer is that Bush has had Donald Trump to deal with, and Clinton hasn’t. In virtually monopolizing media coverage and subjecting Bush to months of public criticism, the New York billionaire has transformed the dynamics of the G.O.P. race in a way that almost nobody anticipated—a point the managers of the Bush campaign acknowledged in an internal memo announcing the cost cuts. “We would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the G.O.P. primary,” the memo said.","2885","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"With Bush’s campaign having been outpaced in such outrageous fashion, it is hard not to feel a little sympathy for him. However, his problems can’t be entirely attributed to the Donald. According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, he’s also running behind Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, and nationwide he has the support of just 7.2 per cent of likely Republican voters. For a candidate whose main selling point was supposed to be his electability, these are terrible numbers. On the Democratic side, Clinton, even at the height of concerns about her e-mail server, maintained a healthy lead in the national polls.","2886","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In part, Bush’s weak numbers reflect the fact he has run a weak campaign—one dogged by his tendency to mangle the English language, or, at least, to use it carelessly. In his first big speech, back in February, he confused Iran with Iraq and got mixed up about how many fighters the Islamic State has. Since then, the list of phrases he has been forced to clarify or disavow is long and embarrassing: “People need to work longer hours”; “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars on women’s health-care issues”; “anchor babies”; “stuff happens.” On the basis of what we’ve seen so far, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Bush simply isn’t a good communicator. Indeed, he often appears to be a terrible one. Asked on Saturday whether his campaign’s cost-cutting showed it was in crisis, he said, “Blah, blah, blah. That’s my answer: blah, blah, blah.”","2887","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"If Bush were wowing the world with innovative and substantive policy proposals, his verbal shortcomings could perhaps be overlooked. But he isn’t. His tax-cutting economic plan, which he claims will increase G.D.P. growth to four per cent a year, is largely based on wishful thinking. His foreign-policy speeches are so vague that they’re hard to evaluate. On social issues, such as guns and abortion, he has said little to distinguish himself from the G.O.P. pack. In 2000, his brother George ran on the platform of “compassionate Conservatism,” which was his way of distinguishing himself from Newt Gingrich and other Republican bomb throwers. Jeb’s only memorable slogan is “Jeb!”","2888","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Clinton, on the other hand, has made it clear that she is running as a progressive candidate; in the first Democratic debate, she defined herself as “a progressive who believes in getting things done.” To back up this talk, she has rolled out a series of proposals, including paid sick leave, expanded child care for preschoolers, a higher minimum wage, tax breaks for firms that promote employee share ownership, and a series of measures designed to make college more affordable. None of the things she has proposed is particularly radical, but taken together they amount to a concerted effort to tackle wage stagnation and boost the middle class.","2889","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Bush has nothing comparable to offer. And, even if he improved as a communicator and Trump dropped out of the race, there would be no assurance that he would win the nomination. Indeed, it now appears possible that his entire campaign is based on two false premises.","2890","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The first is that Republican voters want a shift to the center. The one area where Bush has issued a proposal that separates him from other Republican candidates is immigration. To his credit, he has stuck to the position that law-abiding undocumented immigrants should be given the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. About all that has done is win him the enmity of conservative pundits and talk-show hosts, who accuse him of promoting an “amnesty.” On this issue, most Republican voters agree with Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Polls consistently show that a majority favor the mass deportation of undocumented aliens—an issue Trump has built his candidacy on.","2891","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The second shaky premise is the notion that Republicans are keen on restoring the Bush dynasty. From the beginning, this seemed like a dubious proposition: never in its history has America had three Presidents from the same family. When Jeb entered the race, G.O.P. supporters were being asked to embrace the possibility of three Bush Presidents in thirty years.","2892","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"In its eagerness to promote someone it considered electable, the G.O.P. establishment sought to play down the dynastic aspect of Bush’s candidacy, portraying Jeb as very different from his elder brother: more thoughtful, more conservative, more articulate. Despite these efforts, no groundswell of support emerged for a Bush restoration. Indeed, it now appears that Barbara Bush, Jeb’s mother, spoke for many Republicans when she said, in April, 2013, “There are other people out there that are very qualified, and we’ve had enough Bushes.”","2893","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"The Clinton campaign raises dynastic issues of its own, but there are important differences. As evidenced by the Adams, the Harrisons, and the Roosevelts, the idea of having two Presidents from the same family isn’t alien to the American tradition (even though the Roosevelts were only fifth cousins). And, in serving as a U.S. senator and as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has established credentials independent of her husband’s time in office. At the same time, it’s also important to note that Bill Clinton’s Presidency is far more popular among Democrats than George W. Bush’s Presidency is among Republicans. Some left-leaning Democrats may regard Bill Clinton’s Administration as a neo-liberal sellout, but most associate it with peace, prosperity, and the ability to outlast Republican attacks.","2894","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"Even among Republicans, the last Bush Presidency inspires few fond feelings. It ended with the economy in recession, and with the U.S. military trapped in two costly and unwinnable-seeming wars. For a time, Jeb and his establishment backers pretended they could sustain a 2016 campaign that ignored this toxic legacy, but, once Trump entered the race, the strategy proved unsustainable. In portraying the Iraq war as a disaster and repeatedly tying Jeb to his elder brother, Trump forced Republicans to confront the question of why anybody would think that putting another Bush in the White House was a good idea.","2895","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"There are still more than three months to go before the G.O.P. Iowa caucus, but, if Bush is going to reëmerge as the front-runner, he’ll have to do a much better job of answering Trump’s charges. He’ll get his first opportunity this week, at the Republican debate in Boulder, Colorado. When the pressure was on these past two weeks, at the first Democratic debate and then at the Benghazi hearing, Clinton rose to the occasion and gave her campaign a huge boost. Now it’s Bush’s turn. “Jeb really needs a knockout performance—it needs to be all him, with nobody even close,” a New Hampshire Republican told Politico. “Otherwise those fumes he’s on are going to evaporate even quicker.”","2896","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/jeb-and-hillary-a-tale-of-two-frontrunners"
"There was a moment early on during Thursday’s long-awaited Benghazi hearing when Hillary Clinton looked a bit uncomfortable. It came when the Republican congressman Peter Roskam, of Illinois, was asking the former Secretary of State about the debates that took place inside the Obama Administration in early 2011 about intervening in Libya, where Muammar Qaddafi was struggling to fight off an uprising.","October 22, 2015","2897","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Referring to internal memos and communications that have emerged from the countless inquiries into the September, 2012, deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at U.S. installations in Benghazi, Roskam pointed out that a number of senior officials in the State Department were skeptical about the U.S. getting involved in Libya, as were Vice-President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. “You persuaded President Obama to intervene militarily,” Roskam said to Clinton. “Isn’t that right?”","2898","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"In her response, Clinton conceded that “there were concerns,” and that the decision had sparked vigorous internal discussion. But, she said, “at the end of the day, this was the President’s decision.” Ultimately, she explained, she’d recommended, based largely on “unprecedented requests” from America’s European allies and the Arab League, that the U.S. assist the Libyan rebels, and President Obama had made the call to carry this out, in a limited way.","2899","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Politely but firmly, Roskam said, “I think you are underselling yourself.” In the course of another exchange, he twice repeated his claim that the Libyan intervention was very much Clinton’s creation, ultimately arguing that she was the one who had overcome opposition within the State Department, won over the President, helped get the support of the Arab League, and led the fight to obtain the backing of the United Nations. “You saw it, you drove it, you articulated it, and you persuaded people,” Roskam said. “Did I get that wrong?”","2900","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Clinton couldn’t easily tell the congressman that he was mistaken, given that members of her own staff have portrayed her as an architect of the Libyan policy. Instead, she sought, as she often has in the past, to defend the intervention, pointing to the savagery of Qaddafi’s regime and the limited but decisive role played by the U.S. military.","2901","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Roskam interrupted her, affecting the look of a man who had just been asked to recall a recent root canal. With his time for questioning winding down, he described the current situation in Libya as “a disaster.” Clinton, doing her best to maintain a smile, said, “That’s not a view I will ascribe to.”","2902","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"As the hearing went on (and on, and on), this exchange was lost amid the endless back and forth about security arrangements in Benghazi, the conduct of the committee’s investigation, and, most ludicrously of all, some e-mails sent to Clinton by Sidney Blumenthal, a former political journalist who once worked at this magazine. By the time the hearing broke for lunch, with the Republicans and Democrats on the committee squabbling about whether to release transcripts of a closed-door interview that the panel conducted with Blumenthal in June, it was clear that Clinton was going to emerge largely unscathed. Trey Gowdy and his colleagues on the Select Committee had turned up nothing new—nada—that linked the former Secretary of State to the lax consular-security arrangements identified in previous reports, including one issued in 2012 by the State Department’s own Accountability Review Board.","2903","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"That was confirmed during the afternoon session, as the Republican questioners went over the same ground repeatedly. At one of the many low points, Roskam undermined his earlier points with a blatantly political attack, accusing Clinton of trying to spin Qaddafi’s overthrow to her own advantage and accusing her—shock, horror—of taking a “victory lap” on the Sunday talk shows.","2904","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Of course, none of this had anything to do with what happened in Benghazi. But, in the earlier jousting between Roskam and Clinton about the wisdom of intervening in Libya in the first place, it was possible to glimpse an alternative path that congressional Republicans could have taken over the past three years—a path that might have saved them from being accused (including by members of their own party) of conducting a witch hunt, and might even have served a public purpose. For while the former Secretary of State was perfectly right in saying that the U.S. goal of overthrowing a cruel dictatorship and promoting democracy was a noble one, and that the Obama Administration, in sending U.S. warplanes, was answering international calls for help, the current reality in Libya calls into question U.S. policy decisions. The country is a divided, chaotic, and war-torn place, where rival militias are competing for power and jihadist groups, including the Islamic State, control substantial pieces of territory.","2905","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Did Clinton and those of her colleagues who supported the 2011 intervention foresee any of this happening? What steps did they take to try and insure that Libya wouldn’t disintegrate after Qaddafi was gone? (Just this week, former Secretary of Defense Gates, who was opposed to the intervention, told the Daily Beast, “We were playing it by ear.”) How seriously did U.S. policymakers take the precedent of Iraq, where the United States and its allies overthrew another secular dictator with disastrous results? What lessons should we take from what has happened in Libya?","2906","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"These are all legitimate questions, and an old-school Republican authority on foreign policy—someone like Richard Lugar—would surely have been keen to gather answers to them. Even an old-school G.O.P. isolationist like Jesse Helms would probably have held hearings and inveighed against U.S. interventionism. In this case, though, pursuing such a strategy would have involved concentrating on the larger issues, and conceding that some Republicans, including senators John McCain and Mitch McConnell, supported U.S. action to help the Libyan rebels. It would also have meant dropping the Benghazi investigation once it became clear that there wasn’t any evidence tying Clinton directly to security failures.","2907","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"Gowdy and his colleagues in the House were too small to go in this direction. They preferred to pursue a conspiracy theory that tarred the likely Democratic candidate in 2016, riled up the G.O.P.’s base, and helped the Party to raise money. With the enthusiastic backing of the conservative media, the G.O.P. inquisitors stuck to their self-allotted task even when it was obvious that they didn’t have the goods.","2908","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"All of this is now so obvious that it barely needs repeating. As the Benghazi hearing finally began to wind down, on Thursday evening, some conservative Republicans were probably content to have seen their representatives slinging more mud at Clinton in the hope that some of it would stick. Most ordinary Americans, after following the hearings online or watching the coverage on the evening news, will have been wondering what all the fuss was about. Setting aside the basest form of partisan politics, the answer was not very much at all.","2909","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/where-the-benghazi-committee-went-wrong"
"In the media coverage of Tuesday’s Democratic debate, there was almost universal agreement that Hillary Clinton came out on top. In online polls, several focus groups, and much of social media, though, the story was rather different. Many people insisted that Bernie Sanders was the victor, and that the lame “M.S.M.” had gotten it wrong again.","October 15, 2015","2910","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"I experienced this difference of opinion firsthand. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, I pronounced Clinton the big winner, saying that she had been “sharp, personable, and assured.” I also said that Sanders “gave a good account of himself,” but that didn’t satisfy some readers. Within hours, the complaints were raining in—on Twitter, on Facebook, and elsewhere. Had I been coöpted by the Clinton campaign? Was I watching the same debate as everybody else? Did I have a clue what I was writing about?","2911","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"For the record, my answers are no, yes, and I hope so.","2912","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"It’s certainly possible that I, and many other commentators, got it wrong. The media has erred before, plenty of times. Back in April, when Sanders announced his candidacy, many observers wrote him off as a fringe candidate who wouldn’t have much of an impact. I didn’t make that particular error: indeed, I welcomed Sanders to the race, pointing out that he would “provide a voice to those Democrats who agree with him that the U.S. political system has been bought, lock, stock, and barrel.” That one I got right. But on the Republican side, after Donald Trump jumped in, I underestimated his staying power, as did many other members of the media. Did we get the Democratic debate wrong, too?","2913","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"Let’s look, briefly, at the case for the prosecution. At AlterNet, the alternative-news site, Adam Johnson pointed out, “Sanders won the CNN focus group, the Fusion focus group, and the Fox News focus group; in the latter, he even converted several Hillary supporters. He won the Slate online poll, CNN/Time online poll, 9News Colorado, The Street online poll, Fox5 poll, the conservative Drudge online poll and the liberal Daily Kos online poll. There wasn’t, to this writer’s knowledge, a poll he didn’t win by at least an 18-point margin.”","2914","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"At the other end of the ideological spectrum, Dick Morris, the Republican political strategist and Clinton antagonist, suggested that the media no longer understands a Democratic electorate that has moved to the left and is now highly issues-oriented. “Sanders identified and successfully focused on his two main issues: First, income inequality and the need to break up the big banks and second, the need for more restraint in committing military forces abroad,” Morris wrote on his Web site. “These two positions, clearly articulated in the debate will impel Sanders to a steep rise in the polls.”","2915","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The ultimate arbiter of who won the debate will, of course, be the public, not the pundits. But we won’t get a reliable reading of public opinion until we see some scientifically conducted surveys based on random samples of Democratic voters. The post-debate online polls weren’t of this type: their samples were self-selecting, and you would expect their results to be skewed toward the candidate with the most-committed supporters. In this race, without a doubt, that is Sanders.","2916","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The only post-debate poll I’ve seen that employed orthodox surveying techniques was carried out by the research firm Gravis Marketing, and it showed Clinton as the clear victor. Researchers for Gravis asked a random sample of seven hundred and sixty registered Democrats across the United States this question: “Who do you think won the debate?” Sixty-two per cent of respondents said Clinton, thirty per cent said Sanders, and six per cent said Martin O’Malley. It’s just one poll and its results aren’t definitive, but if most Democratic voters, in fact, believe that Sanders won, it is an enormous outlier.","2917","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The findings of the media focus groups deserve to be taken more seriously than the online polls, but here, too, representativeness is an issue. For the first G.O.P. debate, Frank Luntz, who runs focus groups for Fox News, organized a panel of Republican voters, which said that Donald Trump had performed poorly. Subsequently, Trump’s lead in the polls increased (and he excoriated Luntz on Twitter). Still, the fact that all three of the focus groups mentioned in Johnson’s article identified Sanders as the winner shouldn’t be dismissed; nor should the participants’ responses. When Luntz asked some members of his group, which consisted of Democratic voters from Florida, for a one- or two-word description of Sanders’s performance, these were some of the responses he received: “for the people,” “strong,” “straightforward,” “confident,” “direct,” “sincere,” “powerful,” “educator,” and “smart.”","2918","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"As I noted in my post-debate post, Sanders certainly “got his message through.” As Morris pointed out, it’s a message that resonates with many Democratic voters and is forcing other candidates, Clinton very much included, to adapt to it. It may also be true that Sanders benefitted from the fact that many viewers were seeing him for the first time on the national stage, and that the media underestimated this factor. “Beforehand, a third of Democrats said they didn’t yet know enough about Sanders to have an opinion on him,” Andrew Prokop pointed out in a post at Vox. “Even many of those who did know about him likely hadn’t been exposed to him all that much. So when Sanders makes the case at length for why he’s a democratic socialist, many of these voters might not have heard that before—and might like it.”","2919","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"But just because Sanders did well doesn’t mean he did best of all. In judging the winner of any debate, it’s probably wise to consider at least three questions. Who did the best onstage? Who came out on top in the polls? Who gave his or her campaign the biggest boost?","2920","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"The second question I’ve already covered. The answer to the first one is subjective, though anybody who was on a high-school or college debate team knows that it’s not entirely so. Based on Clinton’s manner, her ability to react to what others were saying, and her deftness in evading awkward questions, I think she delivered the best performance, even though, as I wrote yesterday, I strongly disagreed with some of her answers, particularly those relating to Edward Snowden. Some of Clinton’s Republican critics agreed with my assessment of her manner. Trump said that she “did what she had to do.” Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race last month, said, “She came across as surprisingly very confident and I thought relatively pleasant.”","2921","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"
"So much for technique. The main reason that I think Clinton emerged as the winner relates to the third question: she gave her campaign a huge and much-needed boost. Of all the debate participants, she had the most to lose. After six months in which Clinton struggled to deal with the issue of her use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state, Democratic élites and donors were starting to question her abilities as a candidate. A poor performance on Tuesday could well have engendered outright panic. Clinton not only reassured the elected politicians, interest groups, and donors who have thrown in with her; she dealt a big blow to the “draft Biden” movement, which probably, in hindsight, needed its man to be onstage in Las Vegas.","2922","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/did-the-media-get-the-democratic-debate-wrong"

"Hillary Clinton is, so far, the only declared Presidential candidate known to have seen “Hamilton”: she attended a performance of the show at the Public Theatre, in March, to which she responded with evident delight. The musical—as the world knows by now—draws on rap, pop, jazz, and a variety of other musical genres to tell the story of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury, tracing the arc of his life from his illegitimate birth in poverty, in the Caribbean, to his death, in a duel, at the hands of Aaron Burr, the sitting Vice-President. The show, which was composed and written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also takes the title role, was conceived at the start of Barack Obama’s Presidency; its transfer to Broadway, this summer, coincided with the beginning of the end of the Obama years. With its youthful, almost entirely non-Caucasian cast, and its celebration of the possibilities inherent in building a new nation, the poetry of “Hamilton” is a reminder of the gleaming sense of hope that the election of 2008 engendered—still salutary to recall, despite some inevitable disappointment at the reality of prosaic governance during the past seven years.","September 25, 2015","2935","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"The remaining candidates can now listen to “Hamilton,” even if they are too busy visiting Iowa to make a trip to Manhattan: today sees the iTunes release of the “Hamilton” cast album, executive-produced by the Roots, with the CD version to follow in October. This week, NPR has been streaming all two hours, twenty-two minutes, and thirty-five seconds of it on its Web site. Hip-hop aficionados have been scanning the songs for embedded references, while Miranda—whose protean talents include a mastery of the art form known as Twitter—has been retweeting amateur listeners’ efforts at singing snatches of his songs, under the hashtag #Hamiltunes.","2936","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"For the large field of candidates who think themselves fit to run the country, the history of Hamilton—and the history of “Hamilton”—makes the album well worth playing while driving along in the campaign R.V., or at least worth delegating to a bright young staff member to listen to. (Among many other things, “Hamilton” is a celebration of the bright young staff member: it was as General George Washington’s military secretary in the Revolutionary War that the unknown, unconnected Hamilton first rose to any degree of power.) The show will certainly not appeal to all: John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, is on record as having found a CD by the Roots so offensive that he threw it in the trash, a surprisingly wasteful act for a fiscal conservative. And Chris Christie, the pugnacious governor of New Jersey, has plenty of reason not to be amused by the show’s comic-derogatory references to his state: “Everything is legal in New Jersey,” Hamilton and his son, Philip, sigh in unison, before the latter heads off to fight a duel on the western bank of the Hudson. For others, though, the way that the show filters the concerns of the late eighteenth century through the lens of the twenty-first could make for enlightening listening.","2937","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"Prior to Miranda’s reimagining, Hamilton’s most recent efflorescence in popular or political culture, a decade or so ago, was as a hero to neoconservatives. Then, Hamilton was embraced by the likes of David Brooks, the Times’s neocon opinionizer, and Richard Brookhiser, whose 1999 biography celebrated Hamilton as the founding father of American capitalism. Miranda, by contrast, offers an Alexander Hamilton who speaks for the ninety-nine per cent, not the plutocracy. “The have-nots are gonna win this,” he predicts in a melodious interaction with Bishop Samuel Seabury, King George III’s loyal representative, near the beginning of the show. (Hamilton goes on to chastise Seabury: “Don’t modulate the key and not debate with me!” he insists, a line that encapsulates the show’s knowing interplay between musical form and political content.) Candidates who have sought to learn from the neoconservative agenda of the nineteen-nineties, such as Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, should take note. Miranda’s Hamilton is always a man of the people, even when he’s striving to establish the nation’s first bank.","2938","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"In the person of Aaron Burr, the show poses the dilemma of the political aristocrat. Belonging to the Colonial cultural élite by birthright, Burr, as incarnated by the silky Leslie Odom, Jr., is constantly balancing the desire to serve his own ambition with the pressure to honor his legacy. “My mother was a genius / My father commanded respect / When they died they left no instructions / Just a legacy to protect,” goes Burr’s “I am” song, “Wait For It.” Burr’s dilemma might be a familiar one for Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida. As the son and brother of former presidents, Bush is this season’s preëminent legacy candidate—albeit one whose parents are still around, and occasionally issuing unhelpful instructions: Bush’s mother told reporters a couple of years ago that the country had “had enough Bushes.”","2939","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"Miranda’s father, Luis Miranda, Jr., is a long-established Democratic political operative, which informs the way the show gleefully depicts the hypocrisies of political campaigning. “Talk less. Smile more,” is Aaron Burr’s advice to the hotheaded Hamilton when they first meet, in 1776. Burr is still saying the same thing in the Presidential election of 1800, when he actually runs for office, rather than standing for it in apparent disinterest. “I’m going door to door!” Burr tells Hamilton. “Honestly, it’s kind of draining,” he adds, a sentiment that Scott Walker might have sympathy with. Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, dropped out of the race earlier this week, due to lackluster fund-raising. “We didn’t have a spending problem, we had a revenue problem,” was how Walker’s campaign manager,Rick Wiley, defended his own actions, a line that could have come from a satire about a flailing political campaign.","2940","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"“He seems approachable..?” “Like you could grab a beer with him!” is how two members of the public discuss the aspiring Presidential candidate Burr in “Hamilton”—applying the lowest-common-denominator measure of acceptability that recurs in every contemporary campaign. Less than a year ago, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, was publicly fretting that his party needed to nominate a candidate “who someone actually wants to have a beer with,” a stipulation which, if taken literally, at least would rule out Mike Huckabee, the author and commentator, who generated controversy when he told CNN that he neither drinks, swears, nor listens to “classical music or opera—not my cup of tea,” by way of explaining his opposition to gay marriage. Huckabee’s campaign has been characterized by a tone-deafness masquerading as real talk, as when, last month, he criticized the “Black Lives Matter” movement for “elevating some lives above others.” “Hamilton,” with its predominantly black and Latino cast, exposes and detonates the privilege that underlies attitudes like Huckabee’s—never more than in the moment when Jefferson, played by the African-American rapper Daveed Diggs, receiving a letter from Washington in which he is summoned to become secretary of state, airily delegates it: “Sally be a lamb, darlin’, wont’cha you open it?”","2941","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"“Hamilton” repeatedly shows the political risks of speaking one’s mind: Hamilton’s own career in government comes to an end when he publishes a pamphlet criticizing the newly elected President John Adams: “Sit down, John, you fat motherf-” is Miranda’s concise summary of its contents. This year’s Presidential field includes one candidate, Donald Trump, the reality-show star and real-estate mogul, from whom such an approach would not be entirely surprising, though if he were to say such a thing about any rival, he would likely tweet it to his 4.27 million followers, appending a spurious “best wishes.” It’s surprisingly easy to see how certain themes of “Hamilton” might resonate for Trump. Hamilton is a scrappy self-made man, confident of his own cleverness, and disdained by the political élites for his vulgarity: “Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty,” is how Jefferson, foppish and scheming, disparages him. Trump, never shy to announce his own intelligence or to pronounce upon his own accomplishments, might well have the vanity to identify with Miranda’s incandescent hero.","2942","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"To do so, though, would be contrary to the nativist demagoguery by which Trump has thus far propelled himself to prominence. Both at the Public Theatre and on Broadway, audiences have whooped at one moment in the show: when, about to fight the Battle of Yorktown, Hamilton and his French ally, the Marquis de Lafayette—also played by Daveed Diggs—high-five each other over their revolutionary accomplishments and declare “Immigrants, we get the job done.” It’s a feel-good moment for the well-heeled Broadway audience; and there are probably some seats at the Richards Rodgers Theatre occupied by people who, like John Kasich, might resort to citing conversations with the workers hired to clean up after them when asked about the economic prowess of Hispanic-Americans. But that doesn’t diminish the chord that the line strikes with audiences, nor does it negate the potency of the enthusiastic response to it.","2943","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"“Hamilton” is a hymn to the allure that America promises the immigrant who aspires to reach its shores; it is also an argument for the invigorating power that this nation’s porous borders, and porous identity, have always offered. (This week, the Times reported that the nonpartisan National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine had issued the results of a study which showed that immigrants to the U.S. during the past two decades were assimilating to conform to broader cultural norms no less rapidly than did earlier generations of immigrants—including those of Trump’s Scottish mother and of his German grandparents.) Miranda made a few changes to the script between the Public run and the Broadway opening; one is at a moment at which Jefferson, Madison and Burr are seeking to undermine Hamilton’s political career. “Ya best g’wan run back where ya come from,” they tell him, in an echo of the vile rhetoric that has characterized the current campaign. Just as “Hamilton” casts a retrospective gloss upon the Obama years that birthed it, the musical also looks forward to 2016 and beyond, in which the story of America—“you great unfinished symphony,” as Hamilton calls the country in his dying moments—is still being written. Any candidate who ignores its message will be woefully behind the times.","2944","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-donald-trump-and-jeb-bush-should-see-hamilton"
"You can think of the three minor candidates who were onstage at last night’s Democratic Presidential debate as ghosts, who, in addition to whatever other qualities doomed them to insignificance, represent vanished political types. Lincoln Chafee, as he noted, was the liberal Republican, a once influential, though maybe not numerous, group that was long ago expelled from its original party but has not been fully accepted by its new one. Jim Webb was the Reagan Democrat—the military-culture white Southerner who leans conservative on social issues. Martin O’Malley was the urban Catholic white-ethnic liberal, representing what’s left of the old political machines that produced the Kennedys. None of these groups could be written off in late-twentieth-century presidential politics; now, evidently, they can.","October 14, 2015","2945","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, was the undead: a representative of an ideology, socialism, that was buried with the Eugene Debs campaign of 1912, but now, unaccountably, has been resurrected, with “middle class” replacing “workingmen” in the rhetoric. Yes, Hillary Clinton won the debate, and yes, she will be the Democratic nominee, but the big surprise of the Democratic campaign so far has been voters’ response to Sanders. A year ago, nobody would have predicted that of the other Democratic presidential candidates, Sanders would be the one who mattered.","2946","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There seems to be more going on here than Sanders’s ability to take advantage of the atypicality of Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two voting states in the campaign for the nomination. More than the other candidates, he has a simple, clear, strong message, which he repeats constantly. The packaging—Brooklyn accent, bad hair—reinforces the sense of angry authenticity. And it’s worth noting that he’s obviously uncomfortable when forced outside the tight box of economic populism. That’s why he has trouble talking about Black Lives Matter and gun control.

"One aspect of Clinton’s adept performance last night was that at every opportunity, she tried to change the subject from her Democratic opponents to the Republicans. She knows they’re her real opponents, and a far more significant obstacle to her becoming President. So, on the evidence of the debate, how do her prospects look? Merely being prepared, assured, and on-message doesn’t guarantee victory. You also have to connect.","2948","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The big, obvious gap between the two parties at this moment is on non-economic issues. In the Republican debates, it has been interesting to see how difficult a time the more moderate candidates have had creating any general-election breathing room for themselves on issues like abortion, gun control, marriage equality, and immigration. Conversely, it was interesting to see last night how completely comfortable Clinton has become with what not long ago were dangerously liberal positions, even for a Democrat, on these issues. This year Clinton and her party are obviously betting that social issues will break strongly their way. If they turn out to be wrong, that will be an unpleasant surprise for Clinton.","2949","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"The strong feelings that Sanders has tapped into present a greater challenge for Clinton. For one thing, the voters this year, in both parties, are in an anti-Establishment mood—that explains not just Sanders’s popularity, but also Donald Trump’s and Ben Carson’s. Clinton is part of the Establishment, and there’s no way around it. She was also the least anti-Wall Street candidate on the stage last night. It was almost surreal to see Anderson Cooper, the moderator, have to define Glass-Steagall—a Depression-era piece of financial regulation that Bill Clinton effectively repealed when he was President—because the candidates were so eager to talk about it that they forgot the first rule of debate training, which is never to get technical. Clinton noted that as a senator, she represented Wall Street, and her attempts to distance herself from it were obviously well rehearsed, but not even in Sanders’s range, emotionally.","2950","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"In the Times last week, Thomas Edsall wrote a counterintuitive column arguing that the Democrats have become, if not the party of the rich, the party that has the loyalty of most rich people. Clinton would never sign on to that sentiment, but Sanders’s challenge has forced her into speaking supportively about “capitalism” and “business”—not traditionally Democratic terms—onstage. And on the Republican side, though almost everyone’s rhetoric is anti-government, we have not heard defenses of Wall Street in response to the Democrats’ attacks. The Democrats don’t automatically own economic populism in this election.","2951","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"
"There is no chance that the Republican nominee, whoever it is, will talk like Bernie Sanders. But it’s almost certain that he will argue that, more than Clinton, he understands the behind-the-eight-ball feeling that pervades the American middle class, and propose to do a better job of fixing it than she would. Such an argument won’t necessarily come across as hollow just because it’s coming from a Republican. Bernie Sanders is getting at something powerful, which matters to a lot more people than socialists. Clinton’s biggest challenge is finding her way to a more powerful, and perhaps less prepared, way of persuading the disempowered middle class that she can be its champion.","2952","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bernie-sanderss-challenge-to-clinton"

"Yesterday the New York Times examined in some detail how a House inquiry to examine the tragic events of September 11, 2012, when extremists attacked two U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, and killed four Americans, evolved into an investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State. The Times report shows that Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the committee, gradually abandoned the effort to understand what happened in Libya. Instead, he became obsessed with Clinton’s e-mails.","October 13, 2015","2959","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"
"To be fair, Gowdy’s emphasis on the e-mail issue had some justification. As he documented in an interim report on the committee’s work, the State Department was slow to respond to requests for information and took months to acknowledge that Clinton used a private account. Not for the first time, Hillary’s reluctance to be fully transparent fed the more conspiratorial instincts of her opponents. And not for the first time, her fiercest opponents now look like partisan operatives who cared more about damaging her politically than they did about producing a trustworthy record of what happened in Benghazi.","2960","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"
"Given the polarization in American politics, it takes some serious effort for an investigative body to maintain credibility. It can be done, though, and the best example in recent years is the 9/11 Commission, whose chairman, Thomas Kean, a former governor of New Jersey and a Republican, made a point of forging consensus with his Democratic colleagues on nearly every controversial issue. The result was a report that received acclaim and whose main conclusions are contested only by the lunatic fringe.","2961","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"
"Gowdy’s committee, which has long been criticized for its biases, has now been so discredited that his final product will inevitably be seen as nakedly partisan. First Kevin McCarthy, the Republican Majority Leader, bragged at the end of last month to Fox News that, “everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi Special Committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.” Then on Sunday, Bradley F. Podliska, a former Republican investigator on the committee, stepped forward to allege that he was terminated partly because he refused to focus narrowly on Clinton rather than the broader issues of the attack.","2962","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-house-benghazi-committee-protected-obama"

"It’s not often that a President makes an admission like this. The consequences of Obama—and Hillary’s mistake—have been serious, and not just because Libya is now a chaotic haven for terrorists. The NATO mission in Libya quickly transformed from an effort to protect a vulnerable population from Qaddafi’s imminent attack, to an effort to overthrow the Libyan leader. Obama’s decision to change the objectives of the Libya intervention has made it more difficult for him to gain international support to intervene elsewhere. In 2011, Obama miraculously managed to convince the Chinese to abstain during the Security Council vote authorizing the NATO attack on Libya. (Obama’s strategy in securing that vote is what gave birth to the phrase “leading from behind.”) But as Thomas J. Christensen recently noted in Foreign Affairs, when the Libya mission changed, “China felt betrayed by the UN process” and “subsequently joined Moscow in actively opposing U.S. and European efforts to move against the Assad regime in Syria.” The subsequent collapse of all institutions capable of bringing order to Libya has reminded a lot of people of something that happened a decade before. After it became clear that the Bush Administration had no post-attack strategy for Iraq, Democrats, including Obama and Clinton, rightfully argued that Bush’s lack of planning was scandalous and a prime reason that Republicans couldn’t be trusted on foreign policy.

"The idea that “our guys should talk” and do something—anything—to bring order to a chaotic field of candidates may hold some attraction for the Republican Party this time around. There has been amazement that the field still stands at fourteen (or sixteen, if you count broadly). When the exchange between Clinton and Edwards took place, the Democrats had eight candidates, and that seemed like a lot, even though it was four months earlier in the cycle than it is now. In thinking about why the Republicans’ numbers have somehow not been winnowed, and the possible risks in forcing that question, the Edwards-Clinton exchange is instructive, too.","2970","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"At the time of the forum, Clinton was in first place in the polls, with numbers in the high thirties, and Edwards was in third, polling in the teens. They were both “serious”: Clinton was a senator and a former First Lady; Edwards was a former senator and the 2004 Vice-Presidential candidate (he hadn’t yet lapsed into National Enquirer absurdity). In between them, in second place and polling in the twenties, was freshman Senator Barack Obama, followed by a single-digit panoply of Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, and, not quite registering statistically, Mike Gravel. When the hot-mic video came out, the “not serious” candidates, particularly Kucinich and Gravel, were understandably angry: there was talk among their supporters of an establishment conspiracy. Obama, though, with numbers that would put him at the top of the G.O.P. field now, wasn’t going to be brushed away.","2971","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"

Currently, only Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Marco Rubio would be in the race, with Ted Cruz almost in the running. Jeb Bush would be long gone. (Even through 2012’s odd moments, like the brief Herman Cain spike, Mitt Romney’s numbers never fell so implausibly low.) The establishment bid for seriousness seems to be to keep the field broad enough to encompass its credentialed but low-performing candidates. When several of the candidates’ guys talked this weekend about the structure of the debates, the idea was not to get a smaller group but to perpetuate a large one. (Ryan Lizza has more on those discussions, from which Trump, notably, withdrew, and which may be breaking down.) What is a “gotcha” question, after all, but an attempt to identify disqualifiers, and get the numbers down? Megyn Kelly, of Fox News, correctly characterized the candidates’ various requests for improving debates, which include giving them approval over onscreen graphics and room temperature, by asking if they also wanted “foot massages.” What they really seem to want is for someone to keep massaging the poll numbers. The idea seems to be for everyone to keep hanging on until, miraculously, the Trump-Carson dynamic fundamentally changes. But how?","2972","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"To say that Trump and Carson are not serious candidates is to say that the Republican electorate is not serious. And that judgment, despite the hollowness of the candidates’ ideas, is unfair in one important way. As George Packer writes in this week’s magazine, the Republican Party has failed to respond to the real concerns, fear, and even desperation on the part of many of its traditional voters. Trump’s support is the product not of frivolity but of pain. How profound that pain might be can be seen in another set of numbers, distinct from the political race, about the rising and unexpected mortality among white, middle-aged men without a college degree. They are dying more not because of obesity or heart disease but because of suicide and substance abuse—the physical manifestations of, among other things, disquiet and displacement. The numbers in the study, carried out by Princeton University economists, caught public-health professionals by surprise. If nothing else, the study shows that there are deep pools of unhappiness in this country that the experts don’t understand. Someone has to speak to that.","2973","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"
"At the 2007 forum, the Clinton and Edwards theory seemed to be that without the distractions of the fringe-candidate circus, Obama’s flimsiness would seem obvious, and voters would focus on which of the two of them they preferred. The limitations of their notion had become clear by the time it was effectively a three-person race, and they lost. (In the 2008 Iowa caucuses, Obama won thirty-eight per cent, Edwards thirty per cent, and Clinton twenty-nine.) Indeed, watching the open-mic video now, the most pertinent point is that neither Edwards nor Clinton was, ultimately, the Democratic Party’s nominee. Then and now, it can be hard to tell who is serious.","2974","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-to-be-serious-a-2007-hot-mic-and-todays-g-o-p"

"In the wake of the massacre at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, Hillary Clinton promised that if she is elected President she will use executive power to make it harder for people to buy guns without background checks. Meanwhile, Ben Carson, one of the Republican Presidential candidates, said, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” The two responses could hardly have been more different, but both were testaments to the power of a single organization: the National Rifle Association. Clinton invoked executive action because the N.R.A. has made it unthinkable that a Republican-controlled Congress could pass meaningful gun-control legislation. Carson found it expedient to make his comment because the N.R.A. has shaped the public discourse around guns, in one of the most successful P.R. (or propaganda, depending on your perspective) campaigns of all time.","2976","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"In many accounts, the power of the N.R.A. comes down to money. The organization has an annual operating budget of some quarter of a billion dollars, and between 2000 and 2010 it spent fifteen times as much on campaign contributions as gun-control advocates did. But money is less crucial than you’d think. The N.R.A.’s annual lobbying budget is around three million dollars, which is about a fifteenth of what, say, the National Association of Realtors spends. The N.R.A.’s biggest asset isn’t cash but the devotion of its members. Adam Winkler, a law professor at U.C.L.A. and the author of the 2011 book “Gunfight,” told me, “N.R.A. members are politically engaged and politically active. They call and write elected officials, they show up to vote, and they vote based on the gun issue.” In one revealing study, people who were in favor of permits for gun owners described themselves as more invested in the issue than gun-rights supporters did. Yet people in the latter group were four times as likely to have donated money and written a politician about the issue.","2977","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"The N.R.A.’s ability to mobilize is a classic example of what the advertising guru David Ogilvy called the power of one “big idea.” Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, the N.R.A. relentlessly promoted the view that the right to own a gun is sacrosanct. Playing on fear of rising crime rates and distrust of government, it transformed the terms of the debate. As Ladd Everitt, of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, told me, “Gun-control people were rattling off public-health statistics to make their case, while the N.R.A. was connecting gun rights to core American values like individualism and personal liberty.” The success of this strategy explains things that otherwise look anomalous, such as the refusal to be conciliatory even after killings that you’d think would be P.R. disasters. After the massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, Connecticut, the N.R.A.’s C.E.O. sent a series of e-mails to his members warning them that anti-gun forces were going to use it to “ban your guns” and “destroy the Second Amendment.”","2978","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"The idea that gun rights are perpetually under threat has been a staple of the N.R.A.’s message for the past four decades. Yet, for most of that period, the gun-control movement was disorganized and ineffective. Today, the landscape is changing. “Newtown really marked a major turning point in America’s gun debate,” Winkler said. “We’ve seen a completely new, reinvigorated gun-control movement, one that has much more grassroots support, and that’s now being backed by real money.” Michael Bloomberg’s Super PAC, Independence USA, has spent millions backing gun-control candidates, and he’s pledged fifty million dollars to the cause. Campaigners have become more effective in pushing for gun-control measures, particularly at the local and state level: in Washington State last year, a referendum to expand background checks got almost sixty per cent of the vote. There are even signs that the N.R.A.’s ability to make or break politicians could be waning; senators it has given F ratings have been reëlected in purple states. Indeed, Hillary Clinton’s embrace of gun control is telling: previously, Democratic Presidential candidates tended to shy away from the issue.","2979","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"These shifts, plus the fact that demographics are not in the N.R.A.’s favor (Latino and urban voters mostly support gun control), might make it seem that the N.R.A.’s dominance is ebbing. But, if so, that has yet to show up in the numbers. A Pew survey last December found that a majority of Americans thought protecting gun rights was more important than gun control. Fifteen years before, the same poll found that sixty-six per cent of Americans thought that gun control mattered more. And last year, despite all the new money and the grassroots campaigns, states passed more laws expanding gun rights than restricting them.","2980","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"
"What is true is that the N.R.A. at last has worthy opponents. The gun-control movement is far more pragmatic than it once was. When the N.R.A. took up the banner of gun rights, in the seventies, gun-control advocates were openly prohibitionist. (The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence was originally called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns.) Today, they’re respectful of gun owners and focussed on screening and background checks. That’s a sensible strategy. It’s also an accommodation to the political reality that the N.R.A. created. ♦","2981","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a"

"But in the next breath, he revealed he actually had no plan. “I’m running for President, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people,” he said, in a confusing and bizarre non sequitur. “And what I hear is people’s concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy. People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one per cent.”","2997","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"

"You can’t get any more direct than that: she would be “laying out in detail” the whole plan.

But after two hours of debate, the Clinton plan never came.","2999","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"

"There was a great deal of time spent on what caused ISIS’s rise. Sanders pointed to the effects of climate change. O’Malley and Sanders both pointed to Clinton’s vote in favor of the war in Iraq, which created the vacuum that ISIS has filled. John Dickerson, the moderator, asked whether Clinton’s support for deposing Muammar Qaddafi in Libya also contributed to the massive instability in the region. Clinton herself, in a creative stroke of deflection of responsibility for her role in the events of the last twelve years, argued that terrorism is simply a long-running problem in that part of the world.","3002","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"

She was perhaps trying to show off her knowledge of the region and its history, but it seemed more like she was trying to avoid criticism that the invasion of Iraq and intervention in Libya helped fuel ISIS’s rise.","3003","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/none-of-the-democrats-has-a-strategy-for-isis"
"Some of the explanation for the lack of detail from Sanders, Clinton, and O’Malley has to do with the state of the Democratic primary race right now. As extreme underdogs, Sanders and O’Malley had incentives to attack Clinton’s record on Iraq and Libya, but they have little reason to lay out a comprehensive strategy, especially when appealing to a Democratic electorate that is wary of any military intervention that could produce high casualties for Americans.

"In November, 1954, Dwight D. Eisenhower was mulling a matter that he mulled with some frequency: the effects of age on someone in a stressful, non-stop job like his. He’d been President for nearly two years and, in his diary, wrote down some of the reasons why seeking a second term might be a bad idea: “The greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50,” a need for “younger men in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize the youth, vigor and virility of the Republican Party,” and, perhaps above all, the “growing severity and complexity of problems that rest upon the President for solution.” As far as he knew, he was in good shape, but intimations of mortality shadowed him, and he thought a lot about the next political generation. At a White House political dinner a few days before Christmas, he said, “We have got to begin right now, at the state level and at the precinct level, to see to it that the Party puts up the right kind of young man to run in ’56. All the programs in the world, and all the Eisenhower prestige, cannot elect some revolting old Republican hack against a youthful, able, and personable Democrat.”","September 23, 2015","3007","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Modern readers will note a certain gender bias in phrases like “a man of 70,” “the right kind of young man,” and “virility,” and should know that these somewhat depressed observations came soon after the midterms, in which Democrats took control of the Senate and House, by majorities that the party would keep for decades. Eisenhower’s worries became far more intense several months later, in late September, 1955, when he suffered a major heart attack.","3008","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"This is a roundabout way of getting to the sensitive, impolite subject of when, if ever, a candidate might be too old for the Presidency. It is a question whose premise, in an era when the word “ageism” is embedded in the language, many are inclined to reject, in part because the motives for asking it tend to be suspect. The thuggish wing of the talk-radio community uses the age question to undermine Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who will be sixty-eight in October. That makes her more than a year younger than Donald Trump, although age is the least of many concerns about him. Age should certainly count a lot less than the goofy ideas and inexperience demonstrated by too many Republicans. But the curious absence of a new political generation should concern Democrats, and a party whose other poll-leading 2016 candidates, declared and not, are Bernie Sanders, who is seventy-four, and Joe Biden, who will be seventy-three in November. (Barely registering in the polls are Jim Webb, who is sixty-nine, and Martin O’Malley, a relative teen at fifty-two.) Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee are in their early sixties, but, for better or worse, Republicans also have half a dozen contenders in their forties and fifties. The distinct problem for the Democrats isn’t the presence of elders; it’s the absence of young women and men with the potential to be credible national candidates.","3009","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"Apart from Ronald Reagan, who at sixty-nine was the oldest President ever to be elected, Americans have tended to choose younger men for the office. Franklin D.

"In the early winter of 1956, as the next Presidential cycle began and Eisenhower recovered from his heart attack, he wrote to his childhood friend Edward E. (Swede) Hazlett to say, “We all know that when advancing years and diminishing energy begin to take their toll, the last one that ever appreciates such a situation is the victim himself.” In another letter, to a doctor who’d recently examined him and thought that he was healthy enough to run again, Ike expressed still more doubts. In “contemplating my own future duty,” he compared his job to that of a quarterback: “He may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play…. If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the Presidency.”","3011","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"At the end of February, 1956, a month after sending that letter, Eisenhower announced that he would indeed seek a second term, though he planned to let Vice-President Richard Nixon do most of the campaigning. Ike went on to win reëlection in a landslide. But his health was shakier than his doctors were willing to say, and he suffered two more serious medical alarms—ileitis, an intestinal condition, in the summer of 1956, and a minor stroke, in the fall of 1957. In October, 1960, he marked his seventieth birthday, which, until the Reagan era, made him the oldest President ever to serve.","3012","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question"
"The country fifty-five years ago was lucky that it all turned out as it did. It was also another reminder, just ten years after Roosevelt’s death, that choosing a Vice-President is a serious matter. During the 1956 campaign, the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson, made an issue of Eisenhower’s health—and the possibility that Nixon, deeply hated by Democrats, might become President. Democrats, without a successor generation in clear view, may get lucky in 2016, especially facing a Republican field whose contenders include people who say, inexplicably, as they did in last week’s debate, that George W. Bush left the country safer (Jeb Bush), or that vaccines may cause autism (Trump), or that it’s worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood (Ted Cruz, Chris Christie).

I want to send a message to moderators of upcoming debates that any bias won’t be tolerated.” Rand Paul, who was once the darling of the mainstream media and celebrated as a top-tier Republican candidate, but who has been a non-entity in the Presidential campaign, used the anti-CNBC backlash to raise money.

"With more rumors circulating that Vice-President Joe Biden is about to enter the 2016 race, it’s a good time to take a look at what he might face. A couple of months ago, I suggested that Biden could be a more serious candidate than some people thought. But the obstacles he would face are formidable, and he will have made things even more difficult for himself by not declaring his candidacy prior to last week’s Democratic debate, in Las Vegas. In almost any other country, it would be crazy to suggest that a candidate announcing his candidacy more than a year before Election Day had missed his or her chance. The United States is different, however.","3026","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"In the past decade or two, American Presidential elections have turned into multi-billion-dollar businesses that operate in fifty states, and this imposes certain requirements on the candidates. The obvious one is that they need to raise a lot of money early. The Clinton campaign and groups associated with it have already raised more than a hundred million dollars. Bernie Sanders, who relies largely on small donations, has raised more than forty million dollars. Ultimately, much of this money will go to media companies, in the form of paid advertising. At this stage, however, the main outlays are for building campaign organizations.","3027","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"“You can’t just parachute into a state at the last minute and hope to build a campaign overnight,” Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, told the Times last week. “That’s why we made smart early investments in data, analytics, tech, digital and on-the-ground organizing to build a strong, sturdy campaign designed to fight for and earn every vote in every state.” Biden would have to start from scratch.","3028","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"In appealing to potential staffers, supporters, and donors, he would be able to point to opinion polls suggesting that, currently, he has the backing of somewhere between fifteen per cent and twenty per cent of potential Democratic voters. In late August and early September, as talk of him jumping in got louder, his support rose from the low teens to about twenty per cent, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average. Since then, though, and particularly since the debate in Las Vegas, Biden has dropped back a bit. Three polls that were carried out over the weekend—by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal; ABC News and the Washington Post; and Monmouth University—showed him getting between fifteen per cent and seventeen per cent of the Democratic vote.","3029","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"It isn’t just money and promising poll numbers that Biden lacks. It’s also endorsements in the so-called “invisible primary,” in which the electorate is made up of elected officials and other party notables. From the beginning, the Clinton campaign has made a concerted effort to bring fellow-Democrats onboard. According to an unofficial count kept by The Hill, a hundred and twenty-four senators and congressmen have already endorsed Clinton. The rest of the candidates—from both parties—have sixty endorsements between them.","3030","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"That’s just the disparity on Capitol Hill. Last week, Julián Castro, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, became the second member of President Obama’s cabinet to endorse Clinton. (Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of Agriculture, endorsed her earlier this year.) Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, is one of the leading Hispanic politicians in the country. On Tuesday, the Clinton campaign announced another raft of endorsements, by more than fifty African-American mayors across the country. “Whether it’s her vision for economic fairness and shared prosperity or her steadfast commitment to comprehensive criminal justice reform—it’s clear that Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to be our next president,” Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, and the president of the African American Mayors Association, said in a statement issued by the Clinton campaign.","3031","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Picking up the most endorsements doesn’t guarantee a candidate victory. Historically, however, it has been a pretty good predictor of the eventual winner. The exception came in 2008, when Clinton picked up a lot of early endorsements but ended up losing to Barack Obama.","3032","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Biden is no Obama, of course. He doesn’t have the youth, the excitement factor, or the opportunity to present his potential ascendancy to the Oval Office as a historic turning point. (As a Hillary supporter pointed out to me yesterday, he is, after all, “another old white guy.”) What the Vice-President does have is a wealth of political experience, a reputation for honesty, and relatively high favorability ratings—and not just among Democrats. According to the Huffington Post’s polling average, forty-nine per cent of Americans think favorably of Biden, and 37.1 per cent think unfavorably of him. Clinton, by contrast, has a favorability rating of 42.2 per cent and an unfavorability rating of 51.2 per cent. (Biden also has slightly higher favorability ratings than Obama.)","3033","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"In a general election, Biden’s likability could serve him well. To get that far, though, he’s going to have persuade a lot of Democrats—Clinton and Sanders supporters, especially—to switch to him, and that won’t be easy. There is little in the polling data to suggest that the Democratic electorate is crying out for new candidates to enter the race. Many progressives like Sanders, and Clinton appeals to a broad range of Democrats. In the new Monmouth University poll, seventy-seven per cent of Democratic voters and voters who lean toward the party said that they had a favorable opinion of her. Other surveys report similar findings.","3034","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Campaigns are narratives that occupy mental space in the minds of voters. Right now, Clinton and Sanders are filling most of that mental space, and the plot has been set: insider versus outsider; establishment favorite versus scrappy underdog; first woman in the White House versus first socialist in the White House. The debate in Las Vegas confirmed this narrative. If Biden is going to bust the primary race open, he will need to provide a compelling justification for his candidacy, likely one that goes beyond the personal saga of a decent man and dedicated public servant who is seeking to fulfill the hopes of his dead son—touching and uplifting as that would be. What sort of larger narrative could that be?","3035","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Conceivably, Biden could run as a candidate who can bring together not just Democrats but Americans at large—someone who will fulfill the promise of Obama’s 2008 campaign. At this stage, however, it’s far from clear that voters in the Democrat primary are looking for a unifier. After watching the Republicans frustrate a Democratic President for eight years, many of them may prefer an outsider, like Sanders, or a partisan battler who knows how to overcome political opposition—“a progressive who likes to get things done,” as Clinton describes herself.","3036","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"Realistically, Biden’s only option would be to run a populist campaign, portraying himself as a passionate defender of the middle class who will stick up for the little guy. But, of course, Clinton and Sanders are already doing that, so Biden’s pitch would have to be that he’s more authentic than they are—that he’s someone who rides Amtrak, lives modestly, supports labor unions, is skeptical of overseas military engagements, and has an emotional bond to ordinary Americans. Of course, he would also advertise his experience, his service as Vice-President, and his policy platform (whatever that might be). But the main selling point would be the one that Huey Long and other self-made populists have used to great effect: I am one of you.","3037","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"To pull off such a strategy, Biden would have to demonstrate a level of political skill that was largely absent in his previous two Presidential campaigns: in 1988 and 2008. He would also need to explain away some lines on his résumé, such as his support for a 2005 bankruptcy law that Elizabeth Warren and other critics of the financial industry regarded as a sop to credit-card companies. And, even if Biden managed to do all this, he might still need some unintended help from Clinton, or from the F.B.I. agents who are looking into how, as Secretary of State, she and her colleagues handled confidential information.","3038","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"
"To sum up, the Vice-President is a long shot. In the online betting markets, the odds of him getting the nomination are about four to one, which implies that the probability of him winning is about twenty per cent. After his failure to show up in Las Vegas—a major error if he was seriously intent on running—I’d guess that the real probability is even lower than that. But, if we’ve learned anything thus far in the campaign, it’s that the unexpected can happen.","3039","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-task-facing-joe-biden"

"The days when Labor Day marked the beginning of the electoral season have long gone. Thanks to information technology, money, and the Supreme Court, we live in the era of the permanent campaign.

"Let’s start, as we must, at Trump Tower, where, last Thursday, Reince Priebus, the boyish-looking forty-three-year-old who has the unenviable task of heading up the Republican National Committee, presented a piece of paper to the fellow whose name is on the building. “I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,” the words on the paper said. “I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.” Donald Trump filled in his name in a blank space at the start of the text and signed at the bottom. He or someone else got the date wrong, writing August 3rd instead of September 3rd, but that didn’t matter: the deed had been done.","3042","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"A few weeks ago, when the loyalty pledge was first mooted, it looked like a clever insurance policy for the Republicans. After all, if Trump were to run as an independent and win even four or five per cent of the vote, he could easily hand the Presidential election to the Democrats. But as Trump extended and enlarged his position as the G.O.P. frontrunner, Priebus’s ploy came to take on a rather different aspect. From the vantage of Trump and his advisers, it must have seemed as if the Republican establishment, which they hold in utter disdain, were repeating the mistake of the Trojans and pulling the Greek horse into its midst.","3043","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"If Trump’s candidacy fails, as Priebus and his colleagues are dearly hoping that it will, whoever wins the Republican nomination won’t have to worry about Trump running as a third-party candidate: that’s the theory, anyway. But for the author of “The Art of the Deal,” this was a concession well worth making. For one thing, it assured him that his name will be on the G.O.P. primary ballot in every state, including those, like South Carolina, that had made (or threatened to make) a loyalty pledge a pre-condition for participating. Secondly, the signed pledge goes at least some way toward immunizing Trump against the charge that Jeb Bush had levelled at him on the very morning he signed it: that he isn’t a real conservative, or even a genuine Republican.","3044","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Finally, and most importantly from Trump’s standpoint, if all the other G.O.P. hopefuls go down—or rather, if they fail to get up from the prostrate position Trump’s summer stampede through the polls has left most of them in—the pledge insures that Trump will be guaranteed the support of the party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. As Jim Newell remarked at Slate, “Trump has not pledged to incorporate into his candidacy any of the cheerier tones or traditional Republican policies that the GOP establishment would like to see from him. The Republican Party, though, has agreed to incorporate Trump.” No wonder that, once Preibus had left, Trump called in the press and said he “will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands.” He added: “We will go out and fight hard, and we will win. We will win.”","3045","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"That remains an unlikely outcome, but not nearly as unlikely as it seemed a couple of months ago. Monmouth University’s poll data for June showed Trump’s favorable rating among likely Republican voters to be twenty per cent and his unfavorable rating to be fifty-five per cent. In Monmouth’s latest poll, which was released last week, Trump’s favorable rating among Republicans had jumped to fifty-nine per cent, and his unfavorable rating had fallen to twenty-nine per cent. Even in an era of declining party loyalty and footloose voters, these numbers represent an astonishing turnaround—and one that has sent pollsters searching, largely in vain, for a historical analogy. It isn’t unheard of for a previously unknown candidate to take off like a rocket before exploding at high altitude. But Trump wasn’t an unknown. He was a familiar television personality and blowhard, about whom the majority of Republicans harbored critical opinions. In just a couple of months, he has reversed many of those opinions, raising his positive rating by nearly forty percentage points and lowering his negative rating by almost thirty points.","3046","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Political scientists will be arguing for years about how he managed this feat. Clearly, his critical comments about Mexicans, and his pledge to deport as many as eleven million undocumented immigrants, struck a chord, as did his promise to renegotiate trade agreements that have cost jobs. But what really seems to have enthused the Republican electorate is Trump’s renegade attitude toward the Party establishment and the press. Every time he describes Washington as a hopeless cesspit, paints Jeb Bush as an ineffectual ninny, and jumps on anybody in the media who tries to question him, his numbers go up. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Real Clear Politics poll average showed him leading Ben Carson, another political outsider, by 27.8 per cent to 13.5 per cent at the national level, with all the other candidates stuck in single figures.","3047","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Developments on the Democratic side have been a bit less dramatic, but pretty remarkable nonetheless. At the start of the year, practically nobody in Washington took seriously the prospect of a Bernie Sanders Presidential candidacy. Indeed, some Hillary Clinton supporters were hoping that he would run, on the grounds that he would fill a potentially dangerous void to the left of Clinton with an unelectable presence. Now Sanders is running well ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, the second primary state, and he’s gaining ground in Iowa, the first primary state.","3048","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The level of concern in the Clinton camp is perhaps best conveyed by two reports that appeared in the Times in the past few days, which were based on briefings from Clinton staffers and supporters. One of the stories said that, going forward, the candidate would seek to present a more likable side, demonstrating that she possesses a sense of humor and a beating heart. The other Times article said that the Clinton campaign is hoping to build a “political firewall across the South” starting on Super Tuesday, March 1st, when a dozen states, nine of them below the Mason-Dixon line, will vote in the Democratic primary. A firewall to contain Sanders? He was supposed to be incapable of lighting a gas stove, let alone sparking a raging brush fire.","3049","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"How did the Democratic primary come to this? Sanders deserves credit for recognizing that there is a resurgent progressive movement in the United States, one based on the proposition—shared by many Tea Party members, and even Trump—that American politics is now hopelessly corrupt. Once Elizabeth Warren made it clear that she wasn’t interested in acting as the movement’s standard-bearer in 2016, Sanders seized the opportunity. As the lone Socialist in Congress, he was never going to be accused of being an opportunist or a Johnny-come-lately to the progressive cause. But, at the age of seventy-three, he needed to show that he had the fire and the durability to be a Presidential candidate. This he has certainly done. Rather than engaging Clinton directly, he has stuck to the issues, calling for the public financing of elections, free enrollment at state universities, a breakup of the big banks, and a minimum wage of fifteen dollars an hour. All of these policies are popular, particularly with college-educated liberals, who have been flocking to Sanders in huge numbers.","3050","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The Vermont senator has earned his current position in the race. But he has also received a good deal of help from Clinton, who, despite the endorsement of many senior figures in the Party, is still struggling to recover from some self-inflicted wounds. Earlier in the year, when the stories about her private e-mail system and the tangled finances of the Clinton Global Foundation started to come out, it seemed like the money story would prove the most serious, but it is the e-mail saga that has plagued Clinton’s every step. It continues to damage her reputation. Recently, pollsters from Quinnipiac University asked a random sample of voters which word they most associated with various candidates. When Clinton’s name was mentioned, the three most popular answers were “liar,” “dishonest,” and “untrustworthy.”","3051","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"After this poll received a lot of publicity, some Hillary supporters argued that Quinnipiac had hyped the findings, and they raised some sound points. Out of a sample of fifteen hundred and sixty-three voters, a hundred and eighty-seven people answered “liar,” and it’s probably fair to assume that the vast majority were Republicans. (The sample contained six hundred and sixty-six self-identified Republicans.) Undoubtedly, much of the venom directed at Clinton is coming from ardent G.O.P. supporters, and this shouldn’t be overlooked. But it’s also true that her approval rating among independent and moderate voters has fallen sharply. In a P.P.P. poll released in April, fifty per cent of self-identified moderates had a favorable opinion of Clinton, and forty-one per cent had an unfavorable opinion. Now these numbers have flipped. A P.P.P. poll released last week showed that thirty-nine per cent of moderates view Clinton favorably, and forty-nine per cent view her unfavorably.*","3052","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"The e-mail saga has surely helped to drive this turnaround. While Clinton’s insistence that she didn’t break any laws or violate any rules appears to be true, her explanation for why she did it—for the sake of convenience—beggars belief. The more she repeats this line, the harder it seems to be for voters to avoid the conclusion that she has something to hide. Last week, Clinton told NBC News’s Andrea Mitchell that she wasn’t thinking much about the server when she set it up. “We had so many problems around the world,” Clinton said. “I didn’t really stop and think, What kind of e-mail system will there be?” The day after the interview, the Washington Post reported that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer to set up the private e-mail server, maintain it, and keep it going. And in case you missed it, the staffer, Bryan Pagliano, has reportedly indicated that he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence rather than testify before Congress.","3053","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"To state the obvious, it’s a worrying situation for Clinton. In the past few months, she has laid out a series of liberal-leaning policies on everything from student loans to day care to short-termism on Wall Street. (On Tuesday, she outlined her plans for campaign-finance reform.) Once the televised Democratic debates get started, in October, this extensive and detailed platform, together with Clinton’s ability to master complex policy issues, should place her in a strong position. But for all the political good it’s done her so far, she could have spent her time quoting from the Book of Deuteronomy (or Thompson’s favorite, the Book of Revelation). In media coverage of the Clinton campaign, and particularly in broadcast coverage, the e-mail story has overshadowed everything else, and it isn’t going away.","3054","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On Monday, the Times reported that an intelligence review has concluded that some of the information Clinton received at her personal account was “top secret,” although it wasn’t marked classified at the time. In all probability, there will be more such stories. Indeed, as Labor Day approached, Clinton appeared to be trapped in the same kind of three-sided vice that, over the decades, has crushed many Washington figures. Simultaneously, she had to contend with an F.B.I. investigation into whether classified information was mishandled; a hostile Congressional committee under the control of the opposition party; and a media eager to report any damaging leaks from the authorities. Small wonder that Vice-President Joe Biden was seriously considering a late entry into the Democratic race.","3055","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"All this, and there are still five months until the first primary voter casts a ballot. Before crowning Trump or burying Clinton, it is worth keeping this reality in mind—and a few others, too, such as the fact that early leads in primary races often prove ephemeral. It is certainly possible that Trump will go ahead and win the Republican nomination, but as Larry Sabato and his colleagues at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics said of Trump, in a post at Politico on Monday, “It’s far more likely he will fade long before the primary season does.” Only now is he being subjected to sustained attacks from other Republicans, and, as yet, the media scrutiny of his record has been cursory. For instance, we are still awaiting the first major investigative report into how many undocumented immigrants are employed at the hotels and golf courses that bear Trump’s name. While his bombast has served him well so far, he could yet overreact to criticism and self-destruct.","3056","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"On the Democratic side, Clinton remains highly popular inside her own party, and she has the support of important interest groups that help to mobilize Democratic voters. In the latest national poll of Democrats and voters who lean Democrat, which was released by Monmouth on Tuesday, she was leading Biden by twenty percentage points and Sanders by twenty-two percentage points. Among the electorate at large, Clinton’s favorable rating has fallen well below fifty per cent. But among the Democratic electorate, seventy-one per cent of voters have a favorable view of the former Secretary of State, and just seventeen per cent have an unfavorable view.","3057","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"Seeking to solidify her position and change the post-Labor Day media narrative, Clinton on Tuesday apologized for setting up her own e-mail server, telling ABC News’s David Muir, “That was a mistake. I’m sorry about that. I take responsibility.” It remains to be seen what impact, if any, this statement will have on the polls, but many of Clinton’s supporters will welcome the interview as a step in the right direction. “As long as the email mess doesn’t sink her, Clinton could lose both heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, and still have a fairly unobstructed path to the nomination because of her mighty position with women and minorities,” Sabato and his colleagues wrote on Politico. “This is true even if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race.”","3058","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/2016-where-do-things-stand"
"I’m not sure whether that final assertion takes account of the possibility of Biden jumping into the race with Elizabeth Warren as his running mate.

The President added, “This comes at a time when we see the strength of American leadership across the world. We’ve taken out Al Qaeda leaders, and we’ve put them on the path to defeat.

He still maintains that taking on Qaddafi was “absolutely” the right decision, as he told Thomas Friedman, in the Times, last year, but that doing so has taught him not to engage in such action again without a plan to “fill a vacuum” after victory.","3063","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-new-world-disorder-comment-philip-gourevitch"

Nevertheless, he went on to say, “I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation, Do you realize now what you’ve done?” He didn’t expect an answer, he said, but he made it plain that, in Syria, you have to take sides. “We think it is an enormous mistake to refuse to coöperate with the Syrian government and its armed forces, who are valiantly fighting terrorism face to face,” Putin said, and, with blunt contempt for the Obama Administration’s failed effort to muster an independent, democratic Syrian resistance force, he added, “We should finally acknowledge that no one but President Assad’s armed forces and Kurdish militias are truly fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria.” On the contrary, Putin insinuated, the Americans were trying to work with some of those other terrorist groups, and he warned, “They are just as clever as you are, and you never know who is manipulating whom.”","3067","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-new-world-disorder-comment-philip-gourevitch"
"It is not surprising that the Obama-Putin contretemps was widely reported as a duel. The two Presidents do not suffer each other gladly, and it was impossible to parse all the overlapping and coded agendas in their speeches. And yet, for all their sparring, there was an undercurrent of common cause in their pronouncements on Syria. Putin was plainly seeking to reassert Russia’s position as a power broker in the Middle East, and Obama made no move to block him.","3068","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-new-world-disorder-comment-philip-gourevitch"
"The President has preferred to pay the price of doing too little in Syria, rather than too much. It would be easy to blame him for that, if one could forget about Libya and Iraq, to say nothing of the fact that, last week, the Taliban captured a major city in Afghanistan for the first time since the United States installed the current regime in Kabul, fourteen years ago. Obama did tell the U.N. that he was prepared to put the fight against isis ahead of the fight against Assad, and to work with Russia and Iran to that end, as long as those nations worked to help ease Assad out. That seemed a minor concession, and one couldn’t help wondering why more than two hundred thousand Syrians had died before it could be offered. Then, the next day, Russian planes began bombing an assortment of targets around Syria, and the death toll rose again. ♦","3069","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-new-world-disorder-comment-philip-gourevitch"

"The D.N.C. has held similar meetings for representatives from the five declared Democratic candidates: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Jim Webb, Martin O’Malley, and Lincoln Chafee. The D.N.C. offered the meeting to Biden earlier this year, and the party committee was scheduled to brief his aides back in June, but that meeting was cancelled.","3073","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-clue-suggests-biden-may-run"
"When the meeting was finally held this week, D.N.C. staffers walked Biden’s representatives through the primary calendar, filing deadlines, the mechanics of ballot-access issues, and the complicated details of the party’s state-by-state selection process for delegates and super delegates. The session included a level of detail that would only be of interest to a candidate who is serious about running. For example, the briefing included information about issues such as whether a particular primary state requires a candidate to send a letter to the Secretary of State in order to get on the ballot, or circulate a petition, or pursue some other method.","3074","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-clue-suggests-biden-may-run"
"But, while the briefing is considered an important step for any candidate who is serious about entering the race, how it will affect Biden’s decision is unclear. It may simply be that Biden is still gathering the necessary information to help him make a final determination. And the details of the complicated process of winning enough delegates to secure his party’s nomination might convince Biden that the window to enter the race has passed.","3075","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-clue-suggests-biden-may-run"
"The D.N.C. source, who was briefed on the meeting, said that the information conveyed seemed eye-opening for Biden’s aides. “They probably thought they had a lot longer,” the source said. “The deadlines for qualifying on the ballots for key states haven’t passed yet, but are fast approaching.”","3076","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-clue-suggests-biden-may-run"

"The rumblings in Democratic circles about whether Biden may be leaning toward running seem to be impacting the Clinton campaign. Yesterday, Clinton announced that she no longer supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that, in 2012, she said “sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Additionally, in “Hard Choices,” Clinton’s 2014 memoir of her tenure as Secretary of State, she wrote that the T.P.P. would be a “signature economic pillar of our strategy in Asia.”","3078","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-clue-suggests-biden-may-run"
"The trade deal is vehemently opposed by labor unions, whose support Biden would count on if he enters the race.

"Let’s say you are a diehard Muppets fan with very mixed feelings about the new ABC show “The Muppets.” Maybe you grew up on the Muppets and worry that they are now being cynically marketed back to your demographic with bizarrely adult humor. Maybe you’re not sure whether Kermit would really call Miss Piggy “sexy”—Muppet sex being something you’ve never had to ponder before now. But perhaps you feel ambivalent about condemning such gags, because you don’t want to sound like a prude, and because it’s nice to see the Muppets back on prime-time TV.","October 5, 2015","3080","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"In this case, you may find yourself refraining from criticizing the show by any means necessary, including avoidance of the first-person pronoun (a tactic you learned from Nancy Franklin). You may even distract yourself by deciding which Muppets are which Presidential candidates. (Here goes: Hillary Clinton is Miss Piggy, Joe Biden is Fozzie, Bernie Sanders is Gonzo, Jeb Bush is Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Ben Carson is Rowlf, Marco Rubio is Scooter, Chris Christie is Sweetums, Carly Fiorina is Janice, John Kasich is Sam the Eagle, Rand Paul is Beaker, Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee are Statler and Waldorf, and Donald Trump, obviously, is Animal.)","3081","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"That being done, you have to get down to business. Two episodes of “The Muppets” have aired, but even before that there were signs that this wasn’t your mother’s “Muppet Show.” Over the summer, as part of a cheeky marketing campaign, the “news” broke that Kermit and Miss Piggy had split up, and that Kermit was now seeing a younger pig, Denise. In the pilot, Kermit explains, “What can I tell you? I’m attracted to pigs.” (A future Prime Minister?) (Sorry.) In the same episode, Fozzie talks about his dating foibles: “When your online profile says, ‘Passionate bear looking for love,’ you get a lot of wrong responses.” And Kermit describes his life as “bacon-wrapped hell on Earth.” In the second episode, Zoot draws a penis on a greeting card, and Miss Piggy sleeps with Josh Groban. (Both, thank goodness, are off-camera.)","3082","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"The show is itself bacon-wrapped in a clever premise: Miss Piggy is the host of a late-night talk show, Kermit is her beleaguered producer, and the rest of the Muppets comprise her terrorized staff: sort of a felt “Larry Sanders Show.” The series is shot in the mockumentary style of “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” a contemporary spin on the original “Muppet Show,” which mirrored variety television. Also like its predecessor, “The Muppets” makes good use of celebrity cameos—kudos to whoever thought Reza Aslan would have chemistry with Miss Piggy, because (surprise) he did. And, as TV’s only female talk-show host, Miss Piggy is given the status and ambition she deserves.","3083","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"But the off-color humor seems badly misplaced, as if the show’s creators were trying to beat “Crank Yankers” and “Avenue Q” at their own game. With the exception of Gonzo, the Muppets should not work blue. The problem isn’t that the Muppets should appeal solely to children; Muppets humor has always been sophisticated and self-knowing, a “gateway drug to comedy,” as Jason Segel, the ultimate Muppets superfan, put it. The 2011 film “The Muppets,” which Segel wrote with Nick Stoller, nailed the absurdist tone that had eluded the franchise post-Henson: at once antic, self-referential, and heartfelt. Kids could revel in the anarchic (Gonzo as a toilet magnate), while nostalgists could smirk at the jokes that flew over their children’s heads (Animal in anger management). But the funniest bits were funny for everyone—the villain saying the line “Maniacal laugh!” instead of maniacally laughing—because absurdism, done right, cuts through the age gap. This was a lesson that Segel and Stoller took from the “classic” Muppets films, especially “The Great Muppet Caper.” What’s funnier than John Cleese dryly informing his wife of a “pig climbing up the outside of the house”? Or Miss Piggy, stranded on the side of the road, watching a motorcycle fly from the back a moving truck and remarking to the camera, “What an unbelievable coincidence”?","3084","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"Not that the Muppets are strangers to innuendo. Charles Grodin’s lust for Miss Piggy, in “The Great Muppet Caper,” is legitimately steamy—though it’s never implied that they actually have sex. What the new show misjudges isn’t some kind of moral standard but what makes the Muppets funny in the first place. They exist in the rude, recognizable world of adult humans but are too innocent to notice. It’s funny, in a cheap way, to joke about Zoot being in Alcoholics Anonymous. (“It’s not that kind of meeting,” he’s told in the pilot.) But it’s a lot funnier when Fozzie, at a London nightspot in “The Great Muppet Caper,” says of his champagne, “You know, if you put enough sugar in this stuff, it tastes just like ginger ale!” Maybe that’s the recipe for Muppets humor: take champagne and add sugar. Not salt.","3085","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"It’s a testament to Jim Henson and Frank Oz that the Muppets sensibility has been so tricky to get right without them. After Henson died, in 1990, the brand languished for years under various owners, and its reëmergence has been a welcome consequence of our current mania for rebooting. (As the writer Pixie Casey tweeted, “Racist Atticus Finch and Midlife Crisis Kermit are exactly what we deserve for our collective inability to let go of things.”) Scores of think pieces accompanied the Kermit-Piggy breakup, including one on Miss Piggy as a domestic abuser (though most often she used her karate skills to thump bad guys). The Muppets revival has even brought on an academic volume, “Jim Henson and Philosophy,” with entries on “Fraggle Rock and Post-Structuralism” and “The Metaphysics of Muppetationality.”","3086","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"What is Muppetationality, anyway? To me, it’s a haven for eccentricity, where even “whatevers” like Gonzo have a place. And it’s a style of humor that can work on multiple levels, winking differently at the same fans as the decades pass. So, to those who have been given temporary custody of the Muppets legacy, I ask this: dig deeper, handle with care, and keep it PG.","3087","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/dirty-sexy-muppets"
"In Joe Biden’s political vocabulary, nothing is more important than being “in the deal.” In 2008, when he was weighing whether to accept Barack Obama’s invitation to join the Presidential ticket, his only requirement was a guarantee that he would be “in the deal”—in every meeting that mattered, never unable to reach the President, worthy of inclusion. Once Hillary Clinton began to accumulate the air of a front-runner, logic dictated that the best way for Biden to stay in the deal was to keep alive the prospect of a candidacy, however quixotic it might appear. He played that hand as long as it made sense—and a week or two after it did not. But when the moment passed, Biden made the rarest of choices in Presidential politics today: dignity over ambition.","October 21, 2015","3088","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"In a Rose Garden announcement on Wednesday, with his wife, Jill, and Obama standing beside him, Biden said that he would not run for President. He tried to present a sense of certainty, a look of effortful serenity, but the dominant impression was ambivalence. He couldn’t help frame the choice—a major one, to say the least—in fitful, faintly procedural terms. “I believe we’re out of time,” he said, “the time necessary to mount a winning campaign for the nomination.” Ending the guessing game will insulate him from the perils of a campaign, and reassure the Democratic establishment, but, even as he bowed out, it was clear that he wasn’t quite ready to exit the deal entirely. “While I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent. I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation,” he said.","3089","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"For Biden, after all, it was a harder choice than it is for most. The Presidency—as an idea, a vocation, a validation—means more to him than it does even to the other politicians who believe it should be theirs. When, as a teen-ager at the University of Delaware, he first met the parents of his future wife, Neilia Hunter, her mother asked what he planned to do for a living. “President,” he said—and added helpfully, “of the United States.”","3090","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"At times in his career, he succeeded in suppressing the urge. In 2008, Obama’s advisers favored Biden for Vice-President in part because they assumed that Biden’s age—he will be seventy-four on Inauguration Day, 2017—would prevent the classic White House intrigue: a No. 2 angling and strategizing around his own desire to be No. 1. Biden gave them reason to believe that; during the 2008 campaign, he told Newsweek that he had said to Obama, “I’m sixty-five, and you’re not going to have to worry about my positioning myself to be president.” (Some in Biden’s closest circle didn’t believe that for a second. One of his longtime friends and aides told me last year, “For six years, I’ve been saying, if you don’t believe that Joe Biden intends to run in 2016, you don’t know Joe Biden.”)","3091","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"Biden was not being dishonest when he told the world, for twelve agonizing weeks, that he was unsure whether to run. In a series of interviews for a Profile in The New Yorker, Biden expressed persuasive misgivings about his age and the strain another campaign would put on his family. But he also made clear that he regarded the decision to run as something more than a political question; it got to the essence of how he envisioned the next phase of his life. He said, “I watched my father. I made a mistake in encouraging him to retire. I just think as long as you think you can do it and you’re physically healthy—” He trailed off.","3092","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"The arguments against his candidacy were impossible to ignore: he has high favorability ratings, and a surge of good will surrounding the death, in May, of his son, Beau, but other numbers were inauspicious. In a recent New Hampshire poll by the Boston Globe, he drew only eleven per cent support—far behind Hillary Clinton, at thirty-seven per cent, and Bernie Sanders, at thirty-five per cent. When CNN asked people, in August, if Biden should enter the race, slightly more than half said he should. But when they asked the question again recently, more people said he should not. Moreover, the theory goes, as an outgoing Vice-President, with a long center-left voting record in the Senate, Biden was poorly positioned to challenge Sanders from the left, and would have been forced to compete with Clinton for mainstream Democratic voters. Had he put temperament and instinct above political calculation, it would have been a preview of his vulnerability as a candidate.","3093","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"After Clinton had established a broad lead, there remained one especially tempting reason to run. Once it became clear that the other Democratic challengers—Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chaffee—were immaterial, Biden faced the once-unimaginable prospect that the next person in line, in the event that Clinton stumbles, was Bernie Sanders, who has been, for most of Joe Biden’s political career, little more than a venerable irritant. Clinton has been having a good month, but the election is thirteen months away. If, for any reason, Clinton is not the Party’s choice, Joe Biden will now have to bear watching Bernie Sanders contend for the job that Biden has wanted for six decades.","3094","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"Biden would have had to begin with no money (and no love for raising it), no staff, and no organization in the states. He would have been equipped with little more than a fervent belief that he could be President and an appetite for politics that is inexhaustible even by Washington standards. The former Senator George Mitchell once told me a story of working the phones with Biden, when they were trying to rally support for a bill in the mid-nineties. “Usually a senator would come to me, the majority leader, and say ‘Well, here’s a problem. Can you get the votes?’ Then they go off to dinner.” But Biden asked Mitchell to join him in calling every Democrat at home, a process that lasted until after two in the morning. “After a while, I was up to No. 8, and he was still on No. 2,” Mitchell said, “I said, ‘Joe, I know you want to explain this thing to these guys, but you’ve to got be a little more concise.’ ”","3095","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"
"And that is what makes his decision especially memorable. Biden is giving up his last chance at the role that he has always wanted—and a bet that he believes his son Beau wanted him to place. “As my family and I have worked through the grieving process, I’ve said all along…It may very well be that that process, by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president, that it might close,” Biden said. “I’ve concluded that it has closed.”","3096","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-biden-didnt-run"

"From the beginning of Saturday night’s Democratic debate, Senator Bernie Sanders was very clear on what he wanted to talk about. He began with two sentences about the terrorist attacks in Paris, expressing his horror and disgust, then he moved onto his main message: “I’m running for President, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people. And what I hear is people’s concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.”","November 15, 2015","3099","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"It was an awkward transition, and not one most politicians would have made. Rather they would have devoted, as Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley did, their entire opening statements to the attacks, seeking to come across as empathetic, resolute, and ready to take over as Commander-in-Chief. But Sanders isn’t like most politicians, and he sometimes doesn’t abide by the often stultifying conventions of modern Presidential elections.","3100","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Congenitally averse to political theatrics, he reportedly didn’t practice much before the first debate, and it showed. This time, according to a Times article published on Friday, he agreed to do some real prep work, taking part in serious and lengthy rehearsals, with a staff member playing the role of Hillary Clinton. Perhaps as a result, he looked sharper. His answers were more direct and, unlike in the first debate, he didn’t make any off-the-cuff remarks that risked diverting attention from his message that America’s economic and political systems are broken. In a debate that was inevitably somewhat overshadowed by the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, what he was saying came through loud and clear.","3101","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"The first question put to him on domestic issues was about taxation and how far he would go in raising the top rate of income tax on well-to-do Americans. “In the last thirty years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth,” Sanders said. “And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous. The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one per cent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.”","3102","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"It was a timely history lesson, but it didn’t answer the question. Nancy Cordes, CBS News’s congressional correspondent, pressed Sanders, saying, “Let’s get specific. How high would you go?” Sanders paused for a moment and replied, “We haven’t come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was ninety per cent.” Laughter and applause rang out around the arena. “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” Sanders went on.","3103","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Perhaps the seventy-four-year-old Larry David look-alike from Vermont had prepared this answer; perhaps he hadn’t. In any case, it was a brilliant response, and it also had the virtue of being true, or almost true. (Actually, the top rate under Eisenhower was ninety-two per cent, even higher than Sanders said.) In addition to serving up a timely reminder of what the tax system looked like during a period now widely regarded as a golden one for America’s economy, Sanders threw into sharp relief Clinton’s tax proposals, which would eliminate tax breaks and loopholes for people earning more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year, but wouldn’t raise the top rate.","3104","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"The next topic of discussion was health care. Clinton said she wanted to “build on and improve the Affordable Care Act,” a position she described as “a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders.” Sanders, who supports a single-payer system modelled along Canadian or European lines, agreed that the A.C.A. was a step forward, saying, “We have made some good progress.” Then he added, “I believe we’ve got to go further. I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.” Under the private-insurance system, he went on, “We end up spending—and I think the secretary knows this—far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health-care outcomes are not necessarily that good.”","3105","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"This was another strong answer, which combined an appeal to fairness and egalitarianism with a practical point. Defending his proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from seven dollars and twenty-five cents an hour to fifteen dollars, Sanders repeated the trick. Making the moral case for a living wage, he said, “It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works forty hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.” Then, seeking to counter the claim that setting a much higher minimum wage could cost a lot of jobs, he pivoted to a macroeconomic argument that harks back to Henry Ford. “When we put money into the hands of working people, they’re going to go out and buy goods, they’re going to buy services, and they’re going to create jobs in doing that,” he said. “That is the kind of economy I believe in. Put money in the hands of working people. Raise the minimum wage to fifteen bucks an hour.”","3106","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"All across the country, Sanders supporters, and many others, I suspect, were surely saying, “Go Bernie!” Even O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who also had a pretty good night, seemed impressed. Backing up Sanders’s point about tax rates, he pointed out that the top rate at the start of the Reagan Administration was seventy per cent. And seizing on Sanders’s argument about introducing a living wage, he referred to Maryland under his governorship. “We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it,” he said.","3107","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"As the debate moved on to Wall Street regulation, Sanders sought to exploit what has always been one of Clinton’s biggest vulnerabilities: her ties to the financial industry. Asked by the moderator, John Dickerson, why he had described some of the donations to Clinton’s campaign as compromising, Sanders said: “Let’s not be naive about it. … Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been a major—the major—campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know, maybe they’re dumb and they don’t know what they’re going to get, but I don’t think so.”","3108","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"After Sanders repeated the insinuation in response to a follow-up question, Clinton made a slip: she cited her work rebuilding Ground Zero as a senator from New York, appearing to invoke the 9/11 attack on Lower Manhattan as a justification for accepting campaign donations from Wall Street. Or, at least, that was how a viewer who sent in a tweet (and Reince Preibus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee) interpreted her statement.","3109","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Sanders isn’t really cut out for the role of attack dog, though. Later on, when Cordes read out the accusatory tweet and Clinton sought to defend herself, Sanders rallied to her side, saying, “She worked—and many of us supported you—in trying to rebuild that devastation.” Unlike in the first debate, however, when Sanders came to Clinton’s aid on the issue of her State Department e-mails, he did, on this occasion, combine his friendly gesture with a statement distancing himself from her on policy. “But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power,” he said. “Their business model is greed and fraud. And for the sake of our economy … the major banks must be broken up.”","3110","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Just how effective was Sanders? We’ll have to wait a few days to see whether his performance makes much difference in the opinion polls, which show him trailing Clinton by more than twenty points. What can’t be disputed, regardless of how the horse race evolves, is that he is now making the case for progressive policies in a manner that the United States hasn’t seen in decades. Rather than apologizing for liberal economic policies or seeking to make them more palatable to moderates and independents, he trumpets them at every opportunity.","3111","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"One of Sanders’s strengths is that he represents a movement and not just a political campaign. As I’ve noted before, his campaign is giving voice to a populist insurgency that emerged from decades of wage stagnation and rising inequality, and that was given form by the 2008–09 financial crisis and the Great Recession. In many ways, this movement represents a more coherent, left-wing counterpart to the Tea Party, but there is also something reassuringly old-fashioned about Sanders himself. In responding to Republican efforts to denigrate him as a European-style socialist, or even as a Communist, he stresses the American roots of his platform—correctly pointing out how many of his proposals have roots in the Progressive Era, the New Deal, and the period of postwar prosperity. He did this when he brought up Eisenhower, and he did it again when he was talking about the big banks. “If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he’d say?” Sanders said. “ ‘Break them up. Re-establish Glass-Steagall.’ And Teddy Roosevelt is right.”","3112","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Can Sanders defy the skeptics and go further? The betting and prediction markets are saying probably not. On Sunday morning, the online British bookmakers were showing Clinton as the one-to-ten favorite to get the nomination (to win a dollar, you have to bet ten), with Sanders a five-to-one or six-to-one outsider. PredictWise, an online site that combines data from the bookies and the opinion polls, estimates the probability of a Clinton victory at ninety-one per cent.","3113","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"The Iowa caucus is more than two months away, and these numbers might change. Clinton has stumbled before; she could stumble again. But even if she doesn’t, Sanders’s contribution shouldn’t be underestimated. “In order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution,” he said in his closing statement. “Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process, and tell the big-money interests that we are taking back our country. Please go to berniesanders.com. Please become part of the political revolution.”","3114","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"When Sanders uses words like “revolution,” he isn’t talking about deposing a dictator or storming Congress. He is talking growing a mass, democratic movement that can reverse the direction that the American polity has taken over the past few decades. From the days of Chartism and Progressivism to the civil-rights era, such movements have rarely triumphed in national elections. But when the history books came to be written, that turned out not to matter so much. The movements changed the terms of the political debate. Sanders, in his own irascible way, is trying to do the same thing.","3115","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-loud-and-clear"
"Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, is an unusual politician. When he speaks, he often sounds as though he has just graduated from college with double honors in clichés and platitudes. “I share a sense of optimism for America’s future,” he said in his first answer during Wednesday night’s G.O.P. debate, in Boulder, Colorado. He continued, “Our greatest days lie ahead.” Later, in his closing statement, Rubio said, “We can’t just save the American dream—we can expand it.” I waited for him to talk about “a shining city upon a hill,” but he didn’t get around to it. At the next debate, he probably will.","October 29, 2015","3116","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"But Rubio isn’t just a youthful purveyor of upbeat bromides and echoes of Ronald Reagan. If he were, Jeb Bush would have less to worry about, and so would Hillary Clinton. Beneath his bland exterior lurks a shrewd and feline political operator, with an instinctive sense of balance and a set of claws capable of drawing blood.","3117","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Early on in the debate, Jeb Bush, the benighted ex-front-runner, sought to score some points off of Rubio by criticizing him for his poor attendance record in the U.S. Senate. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,” Bush said, busting in on an interchange between Rubio and Carl Quintanilla, one of the CNBC moderators, about an editorial in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that accused Rubio of ripping off the voters who elected him in 2010. “I mean, literally, the Senate—what is it, like a French work week?” Bush went on. “You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.”","3118","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Rubio was prepared. He’d already demonstrated that fact by seeking to turn Quintanilla’s question into an attack on the media, a tactic that many Republicans adopt when they’re under fire, because it often works for them. First, Rubio pointed out that one of his Democratic predecessors, Bob Graham, missed more than thirty per cent of his votes in the Senate, in 2004, when he ran for President. Then he said that John Kerry and Barack Obama—two more senators who ran for the White House—missed even more votes than Graham did. “So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement,” Rubio said.","3119","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"That response earned him loud cheers from the crowd. Bush waded in with his admonishments anyway. When the former Florida governor had finished, Rubio said, “I get to respond, right?” Becky Quick, another of the moderators, told him he had thirty seconds. “Well, it’s interesting,” Rubio began. “Over the last few weeks, I’ve listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you’re modelling your campaign after John McCain, that you’re going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you’re now modelling after?”","3120","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Rather than answering the question, or doing something else to knock Rubio off balance, Bush said that McCain wasn’t his senator. “Well, let me tell you,” Rubio said. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s vote record. The only reason why you’re doing it now is because we’re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.” Bush mumbled something, but the applause for Rubio virtually drowned him out. “Here’s the bottom line,” Rubio went on. “My campaign is going to be about the future of America; it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. I’m not running against Governor Bush. I’m not running against anyone on this stage. I’m running for President because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.”","3121","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"I wrote all of this down at length because it was what the political pros call “a moment”—something that lasts for more than one news cycle and helps define the event in the public consciousness—which is what all of the debaters are seeking. In attacking his fellow-Floridian, Bush was clearly looking for a moment to change the narrative of his sagging campaign. But because Rubio was sharper and better prepared—he had clearly come with the McCain answer in his pocket, in case Bush attacked him—the moment turned out to be his.","3122","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"In fact, it may have been more than “a” moment. If you believe some of the commentators who were waxing lyrical about Rubio’s performance after the debate, it was “the” moment in which he publicly confirmed that he has displaced Bush as the regular politician most likely to be the Republican nominee. The Fix, one of the Washington Post’s political blogs, ran a piece headlined “How Marco Rubio owned Jeb Bush in Wednesday’s GOP debate.” At The New Republic, Brian Beutler suggested that Bush should do himself and the G.O.P. a favor by dropping out of the race.","3123","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"That’s laying it on thick. Bush kept his cool, and his campaign is right when it says that this contest is a marathon. But when your best-received line is “I’m seven-and-oh in my fantasy-football league,” in response to a question about whether fantasy sports is gambling, the night can only be classified as another disappointment. Rubio, on the other hand, went on to deliver several more zingers. In a debate in which most of the candidates seemed at least as intent on attacking the media as the Democrats, he also managed to link together the G.O.P.’s two main demons.","3124","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Picking up on a comment from Donald Trump about super PACs, Rubio said, “The Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It is called the mainstream media.” With that, he went into a little spiel about the favorable coverage that Hillary Clinton’s appearance before the Benghazi committee received, claiming, “It was the week she got exposed as a liar”—a reference to public statements Clinton made linking the attack on U.S. installations in Libya with an anti-Muslim video. “But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.” Given the well-known antagonism between the Clinton campaign and parts of the mainstream media, including the New York Times, this was an outrageous charge, but it was one that will play well on conservative talk shows.","3125","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Another candidate who got in some radio-ready sound bites was Ted Cruz. The forty-four-year-old Texas senator received the biggest cheer of the night for a rant about the (mostly perfectly reasonable and often commendably specific) questions that the CNBC moderators were asking. “The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks,” he said. Right now, Cruz is not a major threat to Rubio, but on the basis of this debate he could eventually become one.","3126","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"The two men who are currently leading in the polls—Donald Trump and Ben Carson—both had relatively quiet nights. In the case of Carson, who has dismissed the debates as boxing matches, that may not have been a bad thing. As always, he kept calm. He parried a couple of policy questions, denied that he is a homophobe, criticized political correctness, and delivered a couple of uplifting passages about American values. Luckily for him, nobody asked him to explain his statements connecting gun control with the Holocaust. Even if someone had, it might not have made much difference. Whatever is driving Carson’s rise, it isn’t dynamism on the debating stage.","3127","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"Trump disappeared for long stretches, as he did in the second debate. At one point, after he was asked how he would cut taxes by ten trillion dollars without raising the deficit, he looked lost. But he has looked lost before, and it hasn’t done him much harm. Having apparently made a strategic decision not to criticize Carson, who has passed him in one national poll, he saved his venom for John Kasich, who had the temerity to question the practicality of Trump’s desire to deport eleven million undocumented immigrants. “This was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes,” Trump told the audience. (Actually, as Kasich pointed out, although he did work for Lehman, he wasn’t a partner.)","3128","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/marco-rubios-big-night-at-the-republican-debate"
"When Kasich wasn’t being branded an evil and incompetent Wall Streeter, he had a few effective mini-moments, as did Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, and Rand Paul.

"Rubio, on the other hand, might just be ready to do so. Standing between Trump and Bush—both large, hefty men—he appeared small in stature when the cameras panned back.

"In the winter of 2008, Barack Obama was in no way guaranteed the African-American vote in the Democratic primaries. He had split the opening contests, Iowa and New Hampshire, with Hillary Clinton, and had narrowly won more delegates in Nevada, yet the black voters of South Carolina, particularly the middle-aged and graying churchgoers who come out to the polls in great numbers, were torn. At first, some knew so little about him that they were not sure he was black. Others, following the lead of well-known figures in the old civil-rights establishment, felt warmly toward the Clintons and saw no reason to break with them. There was also a more visceral concern: many African-American voters told Obama’s volunteers in South Carolina that they could not shake the memory of the many black leaders over the decades who had met a violent end. When they looked at Barack Obama, hope and change was not the only future they could imagine.","3131","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Anton Gunn, a self-confident young community organizer, told Obama’s campaign chiefs in Chicago that if they wanted to win the state they needed to hire him and follow his advice. The Clintons had already enlisted many black leaders in South Carolina—politicians, pastors, downtown business people—but the Obama campaign could still win, Gunn said, by targetting the “Miss Mary”s, older women who were centers of good will and polite gossip in the black churches, who had a hand in every charity event and Bible-study group. To win the younger black vote, Gunn told the campaign chiefs, they should, in classic hip-hop fashion, distribute free mixtapes of Obama’s best stump performances. Obama, who had to erase any lingering impression that he was a callow newcomer, came to Sumter County and, echoing the language of Malcolm X as portrayed by Denzel Washington, told an enthusiastic crowd, “Don’t let people turn you around, because they’re just making stuff up. That’s what they do. They try to bamboozle you, hoodwink you.”","3132","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"But that was not quite enough. A CBS poll before the primary said that forty per cent of the black voters in the state believed that the country was not ready to elect an African-American President. The campaign planned an event that was intended to resonate more deeply with black South Carolina, particularly with its Miss Marys. The event was to take place in the town of Orangeburg. In 1968, after protests against a segregated bowling alley, police shot into a crowd of black college students, killing three and injuring dozens more. This became known as the Orangeburg Massacre. Michelle Obama went to Orangeburg as her husband’s surrogate. Born on the South Side of Chicago, she was descended from Low Country slaves who worked in the rice fields around Georgetown, South Carolina. At the rally, she assured the crowd that her husband was “running to be the President who finally lifts up the poor and forgotten,” and gently prodded her listeners to tear away the “veil of impossibility . . . that keeps us waiting and hoping for a turn that may never come.” She ended on a note of solidarity and daring: “Imagine our family on that inaugural platform. America will look at itself differently.”","3133","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"On January 26th, Obama crushed Hillary Clinton and John Edwards in South Carolina, sweeping the black vote and winning fifty-five per cent of the vote over all. The victory secured the black vote for Obama during the rest of the campaign and a lead in the primaries that he never lost. At the victory celebration in Columbia, Obama told his volunteers that they had assembled “the most diverse coalition of Americans that we’ve seen in a long, long time.”","3134","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"

"At around nine-thirty on the morning of April 4, 2015, midway through Obama’s second term as President, Michael Slager, a white police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, shot and killed a Coast Guard veteran and forklift operator, a black man of fifty named Walter Scott. Slager had pulled Scott over and told him that one of his brake lights was out of commission. He took Scott’s license and walked back to his squad car. Scott, who had a series of arrests on his record, mainly for non-payment of child support, left his car and began to lumber away. There was a brief struggle as Slager tried to zap Scott with his Taser. Scott escaped at a heavy-legged trot. Slager unholstered his gun and, from a distance of no more than twenty feet, shot at Scott eight times, killing him as calmly as a hunter puts down a hobbled deer.","3136","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"There were no uprisings in North Charleston, as there were in Ferguson and Baltimore, no public displays of mass outrage. Race, it turned out, had not ceased to matter, but forgiveness and forbearance, a spiritual tradition and a temperament rooted in the black church, the most powerful of all African-American institutions, prevailed. Clementa C. Pinckney, a Democrat in the state senate and the pastor of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Charleston—the oldest historically black church in the state—led a rally in North Charleston and campaigned to have police wear body cameras. He also showed an almost unfathomable degree of empathy, and not only with the victims. “Our hearts go out to the Scott family, and our hearts go out to the Slager family,” Pinckney said. “Because the Lord teaches us to love all.”","3137","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Two months later, on the steamy evening of June 17th, Dylann Roof, a twenty-one-year-old ninth-grade dropout, his imagination roiling with Confederate romance and a demented determination to spark a race war, slipped through a side entrance at Emanuel A.M.E. carrying a .45-calibre Glock semiautomatic that he had bought with his birthday money and eight magazines filled with hollow-point bullets. Roof sat down in a Bible-study class with a dozen congregants, putting himself near the teacher, Clementa Pinckney. Roof seemed to listen as Pinckney led a discussion of the parable of the sower, in the Gospel of Mark, but he was gathering his nerve. Writing on a Web site called “The Last Rhodesian,” Roof had portrayed himself as a lonely soldier of racial purity forced to take solitary action: “We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.”","3138","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Finally, Roof, a slouchy, slender blond boy with a bowl haircut, stood up from his chair and fired repeatedly. “We were just about to say the prayer to be released,” Felicia Sanders, who survived, along with her eleven-year-old granddaughter and her friend Polly Sheppard, told a reporter for NBC. “He caught us with our eyes closed.” After the firing began, Sanders lay on the floor and clutched and covered her granddaughter with such force that she feared she would smother her. She could not protect her twenty-six-year-old son, Tywanza, who was shot several times.","3139","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"

"Roof killed nine people, including Clementa Pinckney. In the weeks since the massacre, the Mother Emanuel church, white, angular, and as elegant as an origami crane, has become at once a shrine and a morbid tourist attraction. Small clutches of visitors stand outside the church and stare up at its doors, as if to summon a greater understanding of what took place behind them. They lay carnations next to moldering wreaths and write messages of condolence on placards, a fire hydrant, the narrow trunk of a tree. They stay a few minutes, then trail off to other sites. A block away, in Marion Square, they encounter a statue of John C. Calhoun, the outspoken proponent of states’ rights, secession, and slavery. They take the ferry to Fort Sumter. They visit the city market on Meeting Street and the Old Slave Mart Museum, on Chalmers Street. They shop. They have a beer at Closed for Business and the bacon corn bread at Husk.","3146","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Inside Emanuel, a pastor in his mid-sixties named Norvel Goff, Sr., now presides where Pinckney once did. Goff may be the weariest-looking man I’ve ever seen, with hooded eyes, worry creases in his forehead, an excruciating slowness in his movements. Charged with healing Emanuel’s collective wound, he has preached every Sunday since the massacre that parishioners must show the world “the resiliency of faith”—a refusal to answer hate with hate.","3147","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Early in the Sunday service I attended recently, Goff stood near the choir receiving visitors from out of town. First came an executive from a private consulting group bearing a check for a hundred thousand dollars. Then came the principal of a high school in Liberty City, a predominantly black neighborhood in Miami, along with a busload of his most promising students. Goff listened to their messages of condolence with patience and gravity but also a glint of detachment, even dark humor. He bore the responsibility of graciousness not with churchy formality but with what James Baldwin called the “ironic tenacity” of the blues singer. Goff didn’t need to be told that no check, no embrace, was going to heal Mother Emanuel. The principal told Goff that he and his students had driven from Miami “just to let you know that love is greater than hate.” Goff smiled approvingly for the principal, though it seemed to require a measure of wincing discomfort to do so, and, with a slight fluttering wave, summoned the students to join him up front. Then he turned to his parishioners and said, “I want the world to know we are not in this struggle by ourselves. Praise God.”","3148","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Goff had news. Denise Quarles, who had not been in church since her mother, Myra Thompson, was shot to death in Bible class, was here today, and he asked Sister Denise to stand. A prim, handsome woman, she wore a large metallic button emblazoned with a photo of her mother. Someone handed her a microphone. “My heart grieves every day,” she managed to say. “When I see you, I see courage. When I see you, I see faith.” There was a silence, then an “Amen” from the back. “I’m sitting in the same pew, and I feel her presence when I come to Mother Emanuel,” she went on. She wanted everyone to know that “the prayers work—it’s the only reason I’m able to be here.”","3149","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"The congregation sang a few verses of “I’ll Be All Right Someday,” and Goff came to the pulpit to preach. “Sometimes, I’m a little weary and worn,” he began. “Since June 17, 2015, many from around the country and in Charleston ask the question: ‘How are you? How is Mother Emanuel?’ My response is: ‘With your prayers and encouragement and with God guiding us, we’ll be all right.’ ” Goff made a distinction between the everyday spiritual condition of “joy”—an intense awareness of the gift of life, the fruit of hope, joy as the very condition of being alive—and the banality of “happiness.” There was no happiness. But “even in the midst of trials and tribulations we still have joy,” Goff said, his energy finally restored. “My good days outnumber my bad days, and I will not complain.”","3150","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"What Goff made clear was that members of the community were in a state of immense pain (“post-traumatic-stress syndrome” was the term they often used), but they were alive, and feeling joy in their pews—and at their jobs, and at their Bible classes and dinner tables and Sunday strolls—because of the depth of their spiritual lives. This was the way of a church that had been around since the days when enslaved black men and women, in a quest for safety, community, dignity, cohesion, empowerment, ritual, and peace, broke from white churches and built “invisible” institutions, sometimes called “hush harbors.” The black church, even as it has changed, aged, and, in some places, lost ground to mega-churches, remains a central institution of black life, and of black political influence.","3151","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Appalling as the massacre at Emanuel was, it was not the only event in Charleston that shocked the country. At Dylann Roof’s arraignment hearing, relatives of the Emanuel Nine, one after another, stepped up to forgive the man behind the massacre. “You took something very precious away from me,” Nadine Collier, the daughter of Ethel Lance, said, addressing the accused. “I will never get to talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again, but I forgive you, and have mercy on your soul. You hurt me. You hurt a lot of people. But God forgives you and I forgive you.” Myra Thompson’s husband said, “I forgive you and my family forgives you. But we would like you to take this opportunity to repent. Repent. Confess. Give your life to the one who matters the most: Christ. So that he can change it, can change your ways, no matter what happens to you, and you’ll be O.K.” Felicia Sanders also forgave Roof and later told Jennifer Berry Hawes, of the Charleston Post & Courier, why. “I didn’t want any riots here,” she said. “Why do I need to get up there and cause chaos, and then other kids would get killed and the neighborhood would get hurt? Let the judicial system handle it.”","3152","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"The tradition of forgiveness in the black church is long. In 1974, six years after Martin Luther King, Jr., was gunned down in Memphis, his mother, Alberta Williams King, was playing the organ at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, a hundred yards or so from her son’s grave, in downtown Atlanta, when a young man, firing two pistols, killed her and a church deacon. But, just as Martin Luther King, Sr., had forgiven his son’s assassin, Christine King Farris forgave her mother’s killer. “Hate won’t bring my mother or brother back,” she told the magazine Jet. “It would only destroy me.”","3153","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"James H. Cone, an exponent of black-liberation theology whose books include “Martin & Malcolm & America” and “The Cross and the Lynching Tree,” grew up in rural Arkansas and in the A.M.E. Church. The forgiveness shown by the relatives of the Emanuel Nine was hard to understand for anyone “who hasn’t had to cope with that kind of powerlessness,” he said. “It’s victory out of defeat. It is the weak overcoming the strong. It’s ‘You can’t destroy my spirit. I have a forgiving spirit because that’s what God created me to be. You are not going to destroy that.’ When they forgive, it is a form of resistance, a kind of resilience. It is not bowing down. That is misunderstood by a lot of people, even black people, and even some black ministers. It’s part of that tragic experience of trying to express your humanity in the face of death and not having any power.”","3154","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Clementa Pinckney “combined the spirituality and the political challenge that black people face,” Cone said. “That church was a symbol of that. Black people are a small minority, and we can’t use physical violence. That’s not a possibility. It has to be a spiritual resistance, which is a different thing. And he represented that kind of spiritual—defiant but spiritual—resistance. I was not surprised by Charleston. White people have never regarded us as human beings. There is a deep fear in me still that when I walk out on the street I will end up dead. The power is still there. I have sons who don’t feel like that. They didn’t experience the violence that I knew was there in the South.”","3155","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"The Reverend Joseph Darby, the former pastor of Morris Brown A.M.E. Church, in Charleston, and a leader of the state chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., is revered among the black-church elders of South Carolina. He is also the least restrained among them. He was sympathetic when the mayor and the governor led a peaceful march of solidarity after the massacre. He shed a tear when the Confederate flag outside the statehouse was lowered, having helped to lead the campaign against it in the first place. But Reverend Darby told me one morning recently at the Harbour Club, downtown, that all the “kumbaya stuff” will be meaningless without combatting the institutional racism that still defines the state “and the state of the union”: underfunded, segregated schools, neglected black towns, unjust voter-I.D. laws, gentrification and joblessness in the cities, outsized rates of African-Americans in prison. The surface tone of conciliation, Darby and many others believe, helps to smother the possibility of political change in places like Charleston.","3156","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"“You have a city infected with raging politeness, relentlessly courteous to the point that no one’s doing much of anything,” he said. “This courtesy is hardwired into the American South, but it’s hypocritical. It’s a tradition draped in the antebellum lost-cause stuff, the old Southern chivalrous tradition, and it depends on an African-American population that has to go along to get along.” He went on, “We have never worked through the modern civil-rights era. Laws were passed, but the relationships behind those laws have not fully formed. It’s legal to go anywhere, but if you can’t get a job and haven’t been to the right schools you are still nowhere.”","3157","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"A waitress, a wiry older woman in a pink blouse, greeted Reverend Darby and poured him some coffee. “I had no idea you were with us this morning!” she said.","3158","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Darby smiled and engaged her in chitchat about the heroic heat and humidity before he resumed: “Remember, there was not a trace of ambiguity about what happened here. They couldn’t pull out a rap sheet—these were nine people of impeccable character—and they were killed in a church by a white man who wanted to kill black people to start a race war! And he said so! So it flies in the face of any notion of post-racial America, an America so proud of itself because it elected an African-American President. Some of the reaction is driven by the need to say, ‘It’s not me, I’m not like that.’ Dylann Roof is not that extraordinary. He is kind of typical—extreme, but typical. If you build a politic, as we have done in America since Nixon and Reagan, in which election strategies are based on distrust of the other, well, some folks will react on a political level and vote based on racial fear. The truly unbalanced will do what this kid did.”","3159","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Darby, like others I talked with, was moved and encouraged by Obama’s eulogy for Clementa Pinckney—and not only because of his rendition of “Amazing Grace.” The speech represented a greater willingness to condemn racial injustice, both historical and present-day. Darby recalled how he used to be in on conference calls with other black preachers and Joshua DuBois, Obama’s liaison to religious leaders. “We would tell Josh, ‘Let the President out of the cage! Let him be black!’ ” The preachers were frustrated that Obama’s focus was too often on pull-up-your-pants cultural issues—“almost Cosby-esque in his rhetoric”—but the Charleston speech “rounds it out by saying America is not a fair place.” Obama’s term is coming to an end, Darby said, with a sly, cockeyed smile, and “he no longer has to be the least threatening black man in America.”","3160","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"The speech, though, will do little to change the political arrangements of Charleston. “I’ve been an American all my life and I’ve been black all my life, and there has never been a time in America when someone in power in America says, on his own, ‘Let’s take a different course,’ ” Darby said. “South Carolina has never done the right thing on its own. Slavery ended by federal intervention. Civil-rights laws passed by federal intervention. People change grudgingly.”","3161","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"The gentility of establishment politics in Charleston was performed one night at Mother Emanuel at a wake for Herbert Ulysses Gaillard Fielding. The scion of a prosperous funeral-home business, Fielding was among the first black politicians to win a seat in the South Carolina state legislature since Reconstruction. He was ninety-two when he died. Now he was laid out in a grand coffin flanked by wreaths of red roses and dozens of fraternity brothers wearing black suits and white gloves.","3162","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"James Clyburn, a leader of the Democratic caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives and for many years the most powerful black politician in the state, spoke warmly of Fielding, even though he once ran against Fielding for Congress. The choir sang “Take My Hand, Precious Lord.” Then a white funeral director got up and made what he considered a bold gesture of racial reconciliation. “In South Carolina,” he said, “there have traditionally been two funeral directors’ associations: one predominantly white, one predominantly African-American.” It was time, he said, to merge them. “We’re doing the right thing,” he said, over earnest applause. “Our hearts are in the right place.”","3163","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"The last guest speaker was Joseph P. Riley, Jr., who has been the mayor of Charleston for forty years. Riley is white. (Charleston has never had a black mayor.) A diminutive man with hearing aids, horn-rimmed glasses, and a shock of snowy hair, Riley is seventy-two, and, by the standards of South Carolina, he has been on the right side of history where race is concerned. In 1982, he hired Reuben Greenberg, the city’s first African-American police chief, and kept him in the job until Greenberg retired, twenty-three years later. In 2000, Riley led a march from Charleston to Columbia to demand that the state legislature remove the Confederate flag from its grounds. The route was a hundred and twenty miles, and Riley, at Greenberg’s insistence, wore a bulletproof vest; he finished the march with bloody, bandaged feet. Riley has been a friend to downtown real-estate interests—and that has meant gentrification as well as development—but he also campaigned for the construction of an African-American history museum on Gadsden’s wharf, where tens of thousands of slaves arrived in Charleston from present-day Togo, Benin, Angola, and Nigeria. He is stepping down this year, after ten terms.","3164","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Riley was at ease in Emanuel, and he recalled the “seismic changes” of the civil-rights movement and praised Herbert Fielding as a man of conciliation. He said, “To many white people, uneasy with these changes, Herbert pushed too hard. He seemed like a radical to them. To some in the African-American community, Herbert’s easy grace caused some to call him an Uncle Tom. The radical charge hurt, though he wasn’t that. The Uncle Tom charge hurt him even more—and he wasn’t that, either.”","3165","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Fielding was a man of deliberation, of forbearance, of careful progress, and so are the black candidates who are hoping to succeed Riley. There are three, and the leading prospect is William Dudley Gregorie, a veteran city-council member and a trustee of Emanuel. He tried to beat Riley twice and failed. Robert Behre, who is covering the race for the Charleston Post & Courier, told me that Gregorie has “no real chance.” The favorite so far is Leon Stavrinakis, a lawyer and state lawmaker. Stavrinakis is white.","3166","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"One afternoon, I met Gregorie at his modest headquarters, in a worn-down part of town. He slumped on a couch, looking nearly as weary as Pastor Goff. Coltrane and Monk were playing on a set of small speakers in the hallway. Gregorie is active at Emanuel; he knew every one of the victims, and attended all their funerals. Susie Jackson, who, at eighty-seven, was the oldest of them, sang in the Emanuel choir; she was a close relation of his. Every so often as we talked, he would cry or just stop talking. “I am very . . . tender,” he managed once, while recounting how, on the night of the killings, he waited at a hotel across the street from the church to hear who was alive and who was not. “It is so hard to talk about it.”","3167","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Although Gregorie had lost two earlier races for city hall, he feels that, after the Emanuel tragedy, he’s been “tested,” having been on “the national stage in terms of media.” He had given interviews to the national press, and he spoke briefly at Pinckney’s funeral, before Obama, and was determined “to keep a lid on Charleston,” to avoid any violence. This, he said, was part of his “branding” as a candidate. He said that he was introducing a resolution in the city council to plant nine oak trees in memory of the Emanuel Nine, but he saw no good reason to get rid of the statue of Calhoun down the street: “It would be too divisive.”","3168","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"And yet Gregorie was not all forgiveness. There was a fury in him, too. What had happened at Emanuel, he said, was “not something new” or completely unexpected. “How could it be? Particularly in a city that is a seat of the Confederacy, a city where there were slave owners, the butchering and murdering of slaves. . . . It was evil that came into our church. Pure evil. And the only way that you can fight evil is with good. I think our church has been chosen. Do we know what for yet? No, we don’t. It is an iconic church in terms of its contribution to American history.”","3169","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Mother Emanuel was founded in 1816. Six years later, one of its leaders, Denmark Vesey, a carpenter who bought his freedom with winnings from the East Bay Street lottery, organized what a biographer of his, David Robertson, called “the most elaborate and well-planned slave insurrection in the history of the United States.” Historians have debated the scale and the details of the plot; some say that Vesey secretly recruited thousands of slaves to kill the slave owners of Charleston, seize the arsenal in the city and the ships in the port, and then escape to Haiti, where bondage had been outlawed. The plot, whatever its actual dimensions, was uncovered, and Vesey, along with thirty-four alleged co-conspirators, was hanged. Emanuel was burned to the ground by whites shortly afterward, and was later banned until the end of the Civil War. An earthquake brought it down again in 1886; Grover Cleveland donated ten dollars toward its rebuilding. Booker T. Washington and Martin Luther King, Jr., preached at Emanuel. The massacre this summer, Gregorie said, “is another part of its history. Where will it go?”","3170","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"In 1955, after the conviction of Rosa Parks for violating segregation laws, and in the midst of a bus boycott, Dr. King had just minutes to prepare for a speech at Montgomery’s Holt Street Baptist Church. “How could I make a speech that would be militant enough to keep my people aroused to positive actions yet moderate enough to keep this fervor within controllable and Christian bounds?” he wondered, as he later recalled. “Could the militant and the moderate be combined in a single speech?”","3171","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Militancy with moderation and grace: it’s what’s behind the rhetoric of building bridges, the urge toward nonviolence and forgiveness, the refusal to surrender to hate. In the mid-sixties, younger voices in SNCC and the Black Power movement grew disillusioned with such tactics, and you see a similar disillusionment now among some of the city’s younger activists. They are wary of what they consider the conservatism, even accommodationism, of the black church.","3172","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"One morning, I arranged to meet Muhiyidin d’Baha, one of the organizers of Black Lives Matter Charleston, at a Starbucks downtown. The venue was ill chosen. “This is anti-revolutionary, this place!” d’Baha said. Then he smiled and ordered a caramel macchiato.","3173","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"D’Baha’s mother is Baha’i, and his father is a Muslim. The family moved to South Carolina from Poughkeepsie when d’Baha was thirteen. As a kid, he got in trouble for stealing cars, but then he straightened himself out and went to a good magnet school; in college, he studied psychology and played football. D’Baha is thirty, burly, and wears beaded dreads and a Black Lives Matter T-shirt. He shows great respect to the elders of the black-church community, but he also talks about the insufficiency of “respectability politics” and the barrier that it creates between “the power establishment and the revolutionaries and disgruntled masses.” The voices of forgiveness at Dylann Roof’s hearing struck d’Baha as understandable in the context of the black church and the legacy of civil-rights-era thinking but, at the same time, as a form of political masochism.","3174","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"“That was Charleston,” he said. “That was accommodating white feelings and white superiority. It was ‘Yes, Massa, can I have another?’ But, at the same time, it was spiritual fortitude forged in a crucible of terrorism. It speaks of a spiritual level that I haven’t attained. What it also meant to Charleston was that, without the families’ backing, we couldn’t demonstrate at the pitch we wanted. Walter Scott’s mom said the same thing. When the families give these signals, and the pastors instill in the families a sense of grace and forgiveness, the anger never reverberates. No leadership arose demanding to have this pain recognized. Again, it’s let me accommodate you so you’re not scared, we’ll just get on the bridge and hold hands, Jesus is good, we’re over it. There has been an arrangement here, created over generations, to be able to endure terrorism. At this point, this is the way it is. We endure. We don’t ask for more.”","3175","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Black Lives Matter Charleston is small and unaffiliated with the national movement (which itself is more loosely organized than its impressive influence would suggest). Women in particular have drifted away from the local group, some convinced, as one Charleston activist told me, that the group is too narrow, too splintered, and fails to “advocate for women and queer and transgender people.”","3176","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Despite the modest scale of Black Lives Matter Charleston, the group, along with some other small activist organizations, held a demonstration just after the massacre at Mother Emanuel called “Burying White Supremacy,” near the statue of Calhoun in Marion Square. They began by incinerating a Confederate flag, but then someone set alight a Stars and Stripes. Word got around town, and it was not considered, in all, a helpful gesture. The attempt to “shift the narrative” from conciliation to something more insistent stalled.","3177","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"There are boundaries in Charleston. When d’Baha speaks in churches, he gets the sense that people are unnerved. “They don’t want us to start a riot,” he says, echoing Felicia Sanders. His local goals are in line with those of the black ministers—greater police oversight, greater attention to black schools and black neighborhoods. But his kinship is less with the civil-rights ethos of nonviolence (passive resistance, he says, was “silly” and “dehumanizing”) than with the militant tradition of SNCC, Malcolm X, and the Black Panthers.","3178","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"When James Cone was developing his ideas about black-liberation theology, part of his project was to find a common home for the followers of both Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X. But he still sees the differences in spiritual temperament and tactical thinking between those two poles. “Those young people today have the Internet to organize themselves, and a fierce spirituality that is not necessarily connected to the church,” he said. “The language of the Black Lives Matter movement is connected to the black body. They want society to acknowledge the threat to the black body. They are not saying these lives matter to God. They are saying that they matter to the world. They are not passive in any sense.”","3179","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Last year, after years of debate, Charleston erected a statue of Denmark Vesey in Hampton Park. It had been a struggle. When the city first agreed to put a portrait of Vesey in Gaillard Municipal Auditorium, in 1976, vandals stole it. After the portrait was recovered, it was bolted to the wall.","3180","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"“Dylann Roof was striking at black resistance, and Denmark Vesey and the A.M.E. Church represent black resistance that is rooted in the nineteenth century,” Cone said. “The fact that there is now a statue of Denmark Vesey means they affirm that resistance. That resistance, any form of it, when I grew up, is what white people disliked. Deference is expected of you. Denmark Vesey would not give that deference, and that church represented a refusal to give it.”","3181","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"James Campbell is one of the oldest activists in town. He is ninety, and grew up in segregated Charleston. As a young man, he knew Malcolm X and Amiri Baraka, and taught black studies in Harlem and African literature in Tanzania. In his view, the young activists in the country, though they lack distinct memories of the segregated facilities and the lynchings of Jim Crow, are in possession of a clear sense of purpose. They are, he said, helping “to fulfill” the American Revolution. After the slaughter at Emanuel, he told me, he sent “as a homework assignment” to some young activists in Charleston a copy of a speech that W. E. B. Du Bois delivered in 1946, in Columbia, South Carolina: “Behold the Land,” an address before the Southern Negro Youth Congress. Du Bois was seventy-eight, and assured the assembled:","3182","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"Campbell sees the massacre as a dark chapter in the late stages of a civilizational struggle, from oppression to liberation. When he was a boy, he told me, his grandmother took him to a “serious Baptist shouting church” in rural South Carolina, where nearly everyone in the pews had been born into bondage. She would tell him about life on the cotton plantation, the hideous work under the sun and the lash, the sundering of families, the humiliation and the fear. When rumors reached the plantation that the Union Army was sweeping across the South, the slaves thought that Biblical end-times were upon them. They knew nothing of liberation, only the stories of men in blue burning down the cities of the South. Freedom was beyond imagining.","3183","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"
"“That memory is almost genetic, the DNA of the community, and I don’t think it manifests itself in rage,” Campbell said. “It manifests itself in the resolute patience of a long-suffering people. And their determination is expressed through the permanency of the church. That may wear thin with some of the younger people, but it will be a while before you see it change.” ♦","3184","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/blood-at-the-root"

"If you attended a Bernie Sanders rally this summer, when his seemingly quixotic Presidential campaign began gathering force, you might have noticed a few surprising things about the crowd. One was the scarcity of nonwhite faces—a problem that the campaign would soon be confronted by, very publicly. Another was how many young people were turning out to see an irascible seventy-four-year-old senator from Vermont. But that’s a little like being surprised that some millennials appreciate Neil Young or Joni Mitchell at a time when it’s easy to find songs from different decades in a promiscuous jumble online. Young people who like Bernie Sanders like him because he sounds like an old record. He’s been talking about the injustices done to working people by unequal income distribution for more than forty years. His voice, often hoarse from his habitually loud and impassioned speeches, even has the crackle of worn vinyl.","3195","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In Portland, Maine, on an evening in July, the line to see Sanders looped around the Cross Insurance Arena. Sanders’s popularity had clearly been exceeding his own expectations. In a conversation this summer, he recalled an event in Minneapolis: “I was blown away. We were driving in, we saw these lines of people snaking down the sidewalk. ‘Jesus, what is that? There’s a ballgame going on?’ ”","3196","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At the Portland rally, I met a group of five friends who were drawn to Sanders because of his commitment to banish money from politics: he has sharply criticized the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision, in Citizens United, to permit unlimited campaign spending by corporations, and has lamented the outsize influence exerted by billionaires. Several of the friends praised Sanders’s pledge to raise the federal minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour. One member of the group, Erin Kiley, a millennial who owns Portland Flea-for-All, a marketplace of vintage and artisanal goods, said that she developed “a huge political crush on Bernie” in 2010, after Sanders delivered an eight-and-a-half-hour speech on the Senate floor to protest the extension of tax cuts instituted during the Presidency of George W. Bush. Sanders’s gruffness, didacticism, and indifference to appearances—both he and his wife, Jane, told me how much he loathes shopping—are central to his appeal. All the friends described Sanders as “authentic,” a word that many people would be hesitant to apply to Hillary Clinton. Kiley acknowledged that Sanders’s unvarnished qualities might turn off some voters, but noted that in the current election cycle “the whole spectrum of candidates is less schmoozy, polished, and warm.” She went on, “Everyone seems a little off the wall. Howard Dean was thrown off the national stage for being angry. But people like Trump because he’s an asshole and says whatever he wants.” Kiley’s friend Dawn York, who runs a vintage-clothing shop, said, “Most candidates are robotic and rehearsed.” She saw “a real person in Bernie.”","3197","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders has been known as a democratic socialist for decades. This didn’t matter much to Kiley or York, or to most other Sanders supporters I met during the next few weeks; mainly, they were impressed that he hadn’t shed the term. York thought that, because of Sanders and his “social-media-driven fans,” socialism was “getting a bit of a P.R. makeover.” She noted that sites like Reddit and Twitter were circulating videos of “Bernie explaining why he identifies as a socialist, and what it means to him, in a really positive light.” She added, “The word had a retro connection to Communism and was originally thrown at him as a damning label by his opponents. But for his supporters it isn’t a deterrent.”","3198","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"A 2011 Pew Research Center survey found that, among voters under the age of thirty, forty-nine per cent had a positive view of socialism. (Only forty-six per cent had a positive view of capitalism.) Peter Dreier, a professor of politics at Occidental College, who has written about Sanders, says that younger voters “may not be willing to entertain a whole new system, but they are open to a pretty profound critique of the current one. They’re not as naïve as Americans used to be during the Cold War—they know that there are varieties of capitalism, that there is social democracy in Scandinavia and Canada, where the government plays a bigger role in regulating corporations and in expanding the safety net.”","3199","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At a recent San Francisco gathering for Sanders, I met Derek Zender, a twenty-three-year-old marketing student. He told me that his parents, who live in Orange County, dismissed Sanders as “a decrepit old socialist who means well but doesn’t understand how the world works.” Zender thought they were overlooking the fact that “many American institutions—Social Security, unions, Medicare, the postal service—have elements of socialism.”","3200","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In Portland, Sanders took the stage, a little hunched in a gray suit jacket. His flyaway white hair was largely subdued, but his face turned pink with exertion as he delivered an hour-long speech, during which he did not use a teleprompter and barely consulted a sheaf of loose yellow papers on the lectern. “America today is the wealthiest country in the history of the world,” he declared. “But most people don’t know that, most people don’t feel that, most people don’t see that—because almost all of the wealth rests in the hands of a tiny few.” Sanders signals his moral ferocity by choosing words like “horrific” and “abysmal” and sonically italicizing them, as in “This grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is immoral.” He was born in Brooklyn, and his unreconstructed borough growl reminds voters that he stands apart from the “oligarchy.” His hand gestures are as emphatic as a traffic cop’s. When he delivers speeches, he’ll often jab his finger at the lectern, as though he were enumerating the plagues at Passover.","3201","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Most of his policy proposals have to do with helping working people and reducing the influence of the wealthy. He would like to break up the big banks, create jobs by rebuilding infrastructure, and move toward public funding of elections—and provide free tuition at public universities. (This program would be subsidized, in part, by a tax on Wall Street speculation.) He wants to end the “international embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave.” In the speeches I heard, Sanders rarely discussed foreign policy, though he spoke with conviction about climate change and the need for the U.S. to set an example for Russia, India, and China by using fewer fossil fuels. He tends to sound both doleful and optimistic, like a doctor who has a grave diagnosis to deliver—and no time for small talk—but is convinced that he can help his patient heal.","3202","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Huck Gutman, one of Sanders’s close friends, is an English professor at the University of Vermont; from 2008 to 2012, he served as Sanders’s chief of staff in the Senate. “It doesn’t matter what issue comes up—Bernie understands that the fundamental issue for Americans is economic,” Gutman said. “His record on abortion, on gay marriage, on a great number of things has been very good and very liberal, but he never sees those as the central issues. The central issue is: Are people doing O.K., or are a small number of people ripping them off?”","3203","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Despite this abiding interest, Sanders does not seem to have immersed himself that deeply in the extensive literature on inequality. When I spoke with him in his Senate office, I asked him how his ideas on economic fairness were formed. “No one can answer that,” he replied. “How were your ideas formed?” He did not particularly warm to discussing the theories of such economists as Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty. (Gutman told me, “I read a third of Piketty’s book. I don’t think Bernie would read a page of it.” Sanders was interested less in academic arguments, Gutman said, than in hard numbers that “exemplify the disparities he sees and feels and hears about from people.”) Sanders dutifully mentioned that the economist Stephanie Kelton is an adviser to the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, of which he is the ranking member, but he was ardent in his admiration for Pope Francis, who has condemned the “economy of exclusion.” Sanders called the Pope “an extraordinary figure,” adding, “My God, he came along right at the time we need him!”","3204","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"After speeches, Sanders spars about issues with voters or reporters. Garrison Nelson, a political scientist at the University of Vermont, who has known him for decades, says that if Sanders is walking down the street in Burlington “and somebody yells at him Bernie will talk to him—‘What’s the matter? Whadd’ya mean?’ ” He also understands the necessity of the selfie dance, maneuvering quickly into place and smiling briefly. Sanders does not excel, however, at the middle ground of casual, friendly conversation. He has no gift for anecdote. When talking to voters, Hillary Clinton has perfected the head-cocked semblance of keen interest; it’s clear when Sanders becomes bored. Nelson told me, “Bernie’s the last person you’d want to be stuck on a desert island with. Two weeks of lectures about health care, and you’d look for a shark and dive in.” Nelson has voted for him many times.","3205","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Paula Routly, who is the publisher of Seven Days, a popular weekly in Burlington, told me a story that captured the counterintuitive Sanders charm. In 2012, she hosted a gathering of alternative-newspaper publishers, and tried to show them Vermont at its most distinctive. One evening, Jerry, of Ben & Jerry’s, scooped ice cream; on another, Senator Sanders stopped by a group dinner. As Routly recalls, “There were no niceties or glad-handing before he launched into a brief but impassioned rant, tailored specifically for our group. He told us we were doing a great job of covering the arts but a lousy one reporting on economic issues. Message delivered—he didn’t want to meet anyone or eat anything or answer any questions. He was out of there.” Everyone loved it. “He only talks to people in one register, but it’s a very effective one,” Routly said.","3206","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Though Sanders is steadfastly earnest, the youthful enthusiasm for him often partakes of irony. Whimsical buttons feature the slogan “Feel the Bern,” and Tumblr is full of memes that play up the contrast between Sanders’s age and his popularity with hipsters. It’s similar to the way that some admirers of Ruth Bader Ginsburg have taken to calling her the Notorious R.B.G. Both fandoms combine admiration for progressive conviction with a slightly condescending fondness for cranky senior citizens. Rich Yeselson, a contributing editor at the left-wing journal Dissent, told me, “The sort of detached, post-Jon Stewart generation—they’re the ones putting inverted commas around what Bernie stands for. ‘Look at this grumpy old Jewish socialist from Brooklyn!’ It’s not cynical, though—they really believe in what he’s saying.”","3207","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s message is particularly potent for young people who are struggling financially. Several weeks after the rally, I wrote to Dawn York, and she said that she had been thinking about “how refreshing it was to have someone point out to us that, as hardworking Americans, some things aren’t a privilege, they are a right. . . . I’m self-employed, I started my own business three and a half years ago, and my husband works full-time for Whole Foods—and we barely get by. We own a home, we both graduated from college, and we work more than forty hours a week, and we can barely put oil in our heating tanks in the winter. We have no savings and no way to financially handle any hiccups that may come our way. And I had to be reminded that it shouldn’t be that way.”","3208","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Garrison Nelson describes Sanders as being “more from the nineteen-thirties left than the sixties one.” In June, when NPR’s David Greene pressed Sanders on whether he embraced the phrase “Black Lives Matter,” the Senator got irritated. “It’s too easy for quote-unquote liberals to be saying, ‘Well, let’s use this phrase,’ ” he said. “We need a massive jobs program to put black kids to work and white kids to work and Hispanic kids to work. So my point is, is that it’s sometimes easy to worry about which phrase you’re going to use. It’s a lot harder to stand up to the billionaire class.”","3209","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders does not argue that greater economic equality would end racism, but for most of his career he has subsumed discussions of race under class. Van Jones, a criminal-justice reformer and a former Obama adviser, derides that approach as “trickle-down justice”—and told Salon in August that he had been “warning the white populists in the Party, behind the scenes, for several months, that their continued insistence on advancing a color-blind, race-neutral populism was going to blow up in their faces.”","3210","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"On July 18th in Phoenix, Sanders appeared at Netroots Nation, an annual conference of progressive activists. Before he began his remarks, demonstrators flooded the room and began chanting “Black lives matter!”","3211","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"After taking the stage, Sanders told the moderator, “Whoa, let me talk about what I want to talk about for a moment!” A few minutes later, when protesters again interrupted the proceedings, he addressed them directly: “Black lives, of course, matter. I spent fifty years of my life fighting for civil rights and for dignity! But if you don’t want me to be here that’s O.K. I don’t want to outscream people.”","3212","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"A week later, in his Senate office, Sanders sounded chastened. “The issues these young people raised are enormously important,” he said. The video showing the arrest of Sandra Bland, the African-American woman who died in a Texas jail, had just been released, and Sanders seemed shaken. “It impacted my night’s sleep,” he said. “I don’t sleep that great, and it made it even worse.” He went on, “It’s hard to imagine if Sandra Bland was white she would have been thrown to the ground and assaulted and insulted.” Sanders, speaking more broadly about police violence directed at black people, said, “I plead guilty—I should have been more sensitive at the beginning of this campaign to talk about this issue.”","3213","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"On July 25th, Sanders addressed the annual convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, in Baton Rouge. “I’m aware that many of you don’t know me very well,” he said. His tone was friendlier than usual, and he even made a joke: “I was the best and worst congressman Vermont had.” (Vermont has only one.) One of the convention’s listed sponsors was Koch Industries, and it was the first time I saw Sanders give a speech in which he did not inveigh against the company’s billionaire owners, who lavishly support conservative causes. He had folded in a quote from Martin Luther King, Jr., though, which worked well for him: “Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality. For we know that it isn’t enough to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn’t earn enough money to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?”","3214","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In August, Sanders’s campaign issued a racial-justice platform that recommended police reform, federal funding for police body cameras, a ban on for-profit prisons, and the elimination of mandatory-minimum jail sentences. The platform also included a broad defense of voting rights. (Among other things, Sanders proposes making Election Day a federal holiday.) The document is divided into sections called “Physical Violence,” “Political Violence,” “Legal Violence,” and “Economic Violence,” strongly echoing the language and priorities of Black Lives Matter. At the same time, the platform reasserted Sanders’s core philosophy: “We must simultaneously address the structural and institutional racism which exists in this country, while at the same time we vigorously attack the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which is making the very rich much richer while everyone else—especially those in our minority communities—are becoming poorer.”","3215","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Van Jones said of Sanders, “He’s shown tremendous character in his willingness to engage and grow and change.” But Vermont is ninety-five per cent white, and Sanders needed to establish stronger bonds with black voters. No African-American leader, Jones observed, would be surprised to get a call from the Clintons. Sanders was “a reliable civil-rights vote, but not somebody who has been connected to these communities, to these kids and their neighborhoods. He’s not showing up to the funerals.”","3216","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"American politicians know the power of a personal story. The first lines of Jeb Bush’s biography on his official campaign site describe how he met his wife, Columba: “My life changed forever when I was a young man on an exchange program in León, Guanajuato, Mexico. Across a plaza, I saw a girl. She spoke little English, and my Spanish was a work in progress. But for me, it was love at first sight.” Hillary Clinton’s official online biography sounds like one of those books about great Americans aimed at young readers: her father’s drapery business and “rock-ribbed” Republicanism, her family’s Methodism, and her youthful turn as a Girl Scout all get their due. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator whose critiques of income inequality presaged Sanders’s Presidential campaign, often speaks of her parents’ economic hardship to help explain her values today.","3217","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s campaign Web site lists his educational history, says that he is married to Jane Sanders and that they have four children and seven grandchildren, and mentions that he worked as “a carpenter and a documentary filmmaker” before entering politics. That’s it for personal stuff.","3218","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"There’s something admirable about Sanders’s reluctance to attribute his political beliefs to autobiography: he doesn’t want voters thinking that his commitment to redistributive economics stems from anything other than a deep-seated sense of fairness. He has neither the conventional politician’s instinct for sharing relatable details nor the contemporary left’s reverence for personal testimony. Still, he’s running for President, and so he has reluctantly cracked open the door to his private life, even if his supporters are drawn to him, in part, because of that reluctance.","3219","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"When I asked Sanders a question about his early years, he sighed with the air of a man who knows he can no longer put off that visit to the periodontist. “I understand,” he said. “I really do. For people to elect a President, you’ve got to know that person—you’ve got to trust them.” He insisted that he was happy to talk about his life. But he couldn’t resist sermonizing first: “When I talk about a political revolution, what I’m talking about is how we create millions of decent-paying jobs, how we reduce youth unemployment, how we join the rest of the world, major countries, in having paid family and sick leave. I know those issues are not quite as important as my personal life.” And then, unnecessarily: “I’m being facetious.”","3220","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders did say that two aspects of his upbringing had exerted a lasting influence. One was coming from a family that never had much money. And the other was growing up Jewish—less for the religious content than for the sense it imbued in him that politics mattered. Sanders’s father was a Polish Jew who, at the age of seventeen, came to America shortly after his brother, and struggled through the Depression in Brooklyn. By the time Sanders was born, in 1941, his father was working as a paint salesman. Sanders had an older brother, Larry, and their mother stayed home, like most of the women in their lower-middle-class corner of Flatbush. He went to public schools, including James Madison High School, an incubator of civic talent, from which Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Senator Chuck Schumer also graduated. He didn’t make the school’s championship basketball team—a deep disappointment—but he ran cross-country, and feels that this activity accounts for some of his formidable stamina today.","3221","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"“There was tension about money,” Sanders said of his family. They lived in a three-and-a-half-room rent-controlled apartment, and his mother pined for a house. “It wasn’t a question of putting food on the table. It was a question of arguing about whether you buy this or whether you buy that. You know, families do this. I remember a great argument about drapes—whether we could afford them. And I remember going with my mother when we had to buy a jacket. We went to literally fifteen different stores to buy the damned cheapest—I mean, the best deal.” He went on, “I do know what it’s like when the electric company shuts off the electricity and the phone company shuts off the phone—all that stuff. So, for me, to talk to working-class people is not very hard.”","3222","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"I spoke with a few of Sanders’s contemporaries who had grown up in the same neighborhood, and their memories were rosier: they recalled kids playing stickball on safe, familiar streets until their parents called them home for dinner. But Sanders rarely communicates in the key of nostalgia. He’ll talk about how the “great American middle class” is being hollowed out, but unlike some populists he doesn’t dwell lovingly on the nineteen-fifties, when high-paying manufacturing jobs, union membership, and the G.I. Bill allowed single-earner families to prosper. That’s a political strength, because there are many people—African-Americans, above all—for whom the fifties cannot be recalled as an idyll.","3223","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sid Ganis, a Hollywood producer who grew up in the same building as Sanders, described their neighborhood as an enclave of “ordinary secular Jews,” adding, “Some of us went to Hebrew school, but mainly it was an identity in that it got us out of school on Jewish holidays.” Sanders told me that, in the aftermath of the Second World War, his family “got a call in the middle of the night about some relative of my father’s, who was in a displaced-persons camp in Europe someplace.” Sanders learned that many of his father’s other relatives had perished. Sanders’s parents had been fundamentally apolitical, but he took away a lesson: “An election in 1932 ended up killing fifty million people around the world.”","3224","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s close friend Richard Sugarman, an Orthodox Jew who teaches religious studies at the University of Vermont, said, “He’s not what you would call rule-observant.” But, Sugarman added, “if you talk about his Jewish identity, it’s strong. It’s certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious—except for his devotion to the ethical part of public life in Judaism, the moral part. He does have a prophetic sensibility.” Sugarman and Sanders were housemates for a while in the seventies, and Sugarman says that his friend would often greet him in the morning by saying, “We’re not crazy, you know,” referring to the anger they felt about social injustices. Sugarman would respond, “Could you say good morning first?”","3225","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders attended Brooklyn College for a year, then transferred to the University of Chicago, where he joined the Young People’s Socialist League and the Congress on Racial Equality. He also took part in protests for the desegregation of the Chicago public schools and of university-owned housing. Jim Rader, a friend who first met him in Chicago, recalls that Sanders was a “leader of the civil-rights movement on campus.” Sanders, who received a political-science degree in 1964, has said that he was a mediocre student because he found the classroom boring and irrelevant—and that he learned “infinitely more on the streets and in the community.”","3226","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"By the time Sanders graduated, both his parents had died, and his brother had moved to England. (Larry Sanders, who became a social worker and a Green Party councillor, lives in Oxford.) Jane Sanders told me that it had taken her a long time to realize quite how “alone in the world” her future husband had been during his late teens and early twenties. He did a stint on a kibbutz in Israel, worked as an aide at a psychiatric hospital, taught in a Head Start program, and had a carpentry business with a few other guys in New York. It was called Creative Carpentry, and Rader says that it was accurately named: “They advertised in the Village Voice, but didn’t know much about carpentry. They’d go to the hardware store to buy supplies, and ask the clerk how to do the repairs they’d been hired to do.”","3227","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders got married for the first time, to a woman named Deborah Shiling, just after college, and they took a road trip from New York to Vermont, where Sanders had never been. The couple ended up buying eighty-five acres of wooded land near Montpelier, for twenty-five hundred dollars. They had preceded the waves of back-to-the-land hippies. Sanders told me, convincingly, “I wasn’t a hippie.” He’d been enchanted by the thought of living in lush, green Vermont ever since he and his brother had collected some travel brochures touting the state’s farms.","3228","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders and Shiling soon divorced. (She eventually became a wine and cheese buyer for a Vermont food co-op.) In 1969, he had a son, Levi, with Susan Campbell Mott, a girlfriend. In July, Politico reported that Levi was not the product of his first marriage, as many people had assumed, in an article titled “Bernie Sanders Has a Secret.” It came as a surprise to reporters who’d covered Sanders for years in Vermont, but it wasn’t the sort of revelation likely to scandalize his supporters in 2015.","3229","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders wore his social conscience on his sleeve, but few people who knew him in the sixties and seventies would have predicted that he would become a leading candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination. In those days, he occupied himself by writing freelance articles—critiques of the stultifying effects of office work or the social-control mechanism of television—and by making very low-budget educational filmstrips. It’s safe to say that had Sanders stuck with that career he would not have given Ken Burns a run for his money. One filmstrip, a portrait of Sanders’s hero, the socialist Eugene V. Debs, was rendered with static images that remained on the screen for a good long while. Sanders himself voiced Debs, an Indiana native, making him sound like a guy from Flatbush. A narrator chided viewers that if they were like the average American “who watches television forty hours a week” they would know “such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman” and “have heard about dozens of different kinds of underarm spray deodorants” but would likely never have heard of Debs. (Another cultural foray of Sanders’s that makes you glad he stuck with politics: a 1987 cassette tape in which he talk-sings folk songs, William Shatner style. Imagine “This Land Is Your Land” recited, in stentorian tones, over reggae-style guitar.)","3230","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"People who knew Sanders when he was in his thirties tend to share stories about how broke and frugal he was. Rader told me that when Sanders first bought land in Vermont, and was still living part time in New York, he sometimes camped out in the new property’s only shelter: a maple-sugar shack. He had devised his own equivalent of Sterno, which his friends dubbed Berno. “It was a roll of toilet paper soaked in lighter fluid inside a coffee can,” Rader said. “He’d cook over that.”","3231","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In 1971, Rader invited Sanders to a meeting of Vermont’s left-wing Liberty Union Party, in Plainfield. Sanders brought his son along, and there’s a photograph of them at the meeting: Sanders is skinny, serious, with a luxuriant head of curls, uninhibited sideburns, and Buddy Holly glasses; his towheaded toddler sits in his lap. The organizers asked if anyone would run for the Senate, and Sanders, one of the willing few, got the nod. It was the beginning of his political career, though he shared the fate of most Liberty Union candidates: he lost by an enormous margin. During the next ten years, he ran twice for senator and twice for governor, and never got more than six per cent of the vote. Nevertheless, he discovered that he had an appetite for campaigning—and a keen desire to hold elected office. “The difference between Bernie and most of the lefties is Bernie wants to win,” Garrison Nelson said. “Most lefties don’t want to win, because if you win you sell out your purity.”","3232","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In 1980, Sanders’s friend Richard Sugarman suggested that he try for mayor of Burlington. Locals were disenchanted with the five-term incumbent, a Democrat named Gordon Paquette. Sanders ran as an Independent, and won by ten votes. Even in Vermont, it was unusual to elect a socialist in the time of Ronald Reagan; Sanders was a thirty-nine-year-old man who didn’t own a suit. As Paula Routly told me, “Monied interests were shaking in their boots at first.”","3233","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Yet Sanders turned out to be a popular and effective mayor, and more pragmatic than some might have predicted. True, he travelled to Nicaragua, where he met with Daniel Ortega and found a sister city for Burlington. (Vermont reporters dubbed the mayor and his coalition the Sandernistas.) But he also presided over economic development that transformed the city into a hipper, more forward-looking place—one of those small cities that appear on lists of the most livable. And he did so without the kind of wrenching gentrification that he abhorred. His administration devised creative solutions for preserving affordable housing, including a community land trust that enabled low-income residents to buy homes. It became a model for other cities. Sanders also resisted a developer’s plan to turn the derelict Lake Champlain waterfront into a cluster of high-rises, promising instead public access and open space. Today, the waterfront has a park, a bike trail, a science center, a community boathouse, and limited commercial development. He created a youth office, an arts council, and a women’s commission, and during his tenure minor-league baseball came to Burlington. Business leaders learned, Nelson said, “not to fear him.” Jim Condon, a Vermont state legislator and a former reporter who used to cover Mayor Sanders, wrote of him recently, “He got a lot done, but not through the art of gentle persuasion. Bernie’s style was top-down and confrontational.” Still, he was reëlected three times.","3234","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders met Jane O’Meara Driscoll, a community organizer nine years his junior and a divorced mother of three young children, when she invited him to a debate during his first mayoral campaign. After he was elected, he named her the director of a new office dedicated to improving the lives of kids and teen-agers in Burlington. They were married in 1988, and spent what even Sanders admits was “a strange honeymoon,” in the Soviet Union, finalizing a sister-city relationship with the city of Yaroslavl. Jane has worked closely with him ever since, on a volunteer basis—she was his chief of staff for a year in the House, and has handled his press relations at various times. Along the way, she had served as the provost of Goddard College, in Plainfield, where she had earned a bachelor’s degree in social work, and, later, the president of Burlington College. All four children in the Sanders family are now grown. Levi Sanders works as a paralegal at Boston Legal Services; Heather directs the Sedona Yoga Festival with her husband; Carina started a woodworking school, and has served as a state legislator in Vermont; Dave is a senior executive at a quintessential Vermont company, Burton Snowboards.","3235","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Jane typically accompanies her husband on the Presidential campaign trail. She smiles more easily than he does, and looks approachable in her slacks and patterned tunic tops. In August, we met in Burlington, and though Jane was nursing a campaign-trail cough, she was animated about her husband: “I feel more, every day, that he can win. My kids find it really frustrating that they always say in the media, ‘But, of course, he can’t win.’” She went on, “I just tell them, ‘They have said he can’t do this until we prove we can. They’re gonna say he can’t until we can. And that’s what’s always happened with Bernie.’” She mentioned a Quinnipiac University poll showing that, in a general-election contest against Donald Trump, Sanders would win by eight percentage points. (The same poll indicated that Vice-President Joe Biden, who is considering entering the race, would win by twelve points.) “Bernie can defeat Republicans—he’s done it here,” Jane said. “And he’s had them join him on certain things. He’s a democratic socialist, but he’ll work with Republicans to get things done.”","3236","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"When Sanders first ran for the House of Representatives, in 1988, he lost to a Republican named Peter Smith, the scion of a banking family. During Smith’s first term, he co-sponsored an assault-rifle ban. In 1990, Sanders ran again, and the N.R.A. went after Smith, sending letters to its Vermont members describing Sanders as the lesser of two evils, since he wasn’t publicly supporting the ban. Sanders won. This is the origin of the critique that Sanders has weak gun-control credentials for a progressive. Vermont is a gun-friendly state: twenty-eight per cent of its residents own firearms, according to a recent survey, and it has some of the nation’s most permissive gun laws.","3237","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In national office, Sanders has not been a vocal proponent of strict gun control. In 1993, he voted against the Brady Bill, objecting to its imposition of a five-day waiting period to buy a handgun. And in 2009 he voted to allow guns in national parks and on Amtrak trains. Over the years, he has also voted for some restrictions, including a semi-automatic-assault-weapons ban and instant criminal-background checks. The N.R.A. has given him grades ranging from C- to F. (It’s a tough grader.) But he has never been out front on the issue, partly because it doesn’t seem to engage him deeply, and partly because he wants to retain the loyalty of voters in northeast Vermont, where hunting is popular. Sanders tends to present guns as an urban problem that Vermonters can afford not to worry about, though mass shootings can happen anywhere and suicides by gun are as much a problem in Vermont as they are in other states. He told me, “I’m proud of my state, and I think I’m in a good position to try to bridge the gap between urban America—where guns mean one thing, where guns mean guns in the hands of kids who are shooting each other or shooting at police officers—and rural America, where significant majorities of people are gun owners, and ninety-nine per cent of them are lawful.”","3238","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s congressional career did not get off to a promising start. As an Independent, he had a hard time landing committee assignments. Garrison Nelson recalls, “Bernie shows up in Washington in 1991, there’s still a chunk of Southerners in the Democratic caucus, and they do not want Bernie in the caucus.” Sanders didn’t help matters by giving more than one interview denouncing Congress. “This place is not working,” he told the Associated Press. “It is failing. Change is not going to take place until many hundreds of these people are thrown out of their offices.” He went on, “Congress does not have the courage to stand up to the powerful interests. I have the freedom to speak my mind.”","3239","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Some of his colleagues returned the favor. Joe Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat who was the chairman of the influential House Rules Committee, told the A.P. reporter, “He screams and hollers, but he is all alone.” Another Democrat from the Massachusetts delegation, Barney Frank, was even more blunt. “Bernie alienates his natural allies,” he said. “His holier-than-thou attitude—saying, in a very loud voice, he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else—really undercuts his effectiveness.”","3240","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Nelson told me that, when he ran into Sanders in Burlington, he warned him not to keep “pissing in the soup,” adding, “You’re our only representative!” According to Nelson, Sanders said, “Gary, you have no idea how totally corrupt it is.” Nelson responded, “Bernie, I’m a historian of Congress. Give me a year, I’ll give you a scandal.”","3241","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In time, Sanders became slightly more discriminating in his criticism, and made some allies. He was one of the founding members and the first chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has grown steadily over the years, from six members in 1991 to seventy-one today. The C.P.C. produces an annual progressive budget as an alternative to the one that actually passes; it tends to operate mainly as a conscience of the left. He worked hard with Democrats to keep jobs in his state and campaigned to strengthen federal regulation of milk prices, because it helped Vermont dairy farmers. (He once wrote that he’d developed “an almost emotional attachment” to these farmers, despite not knowing “one end of a cow from the other” when he arrived in the state.) In national matters such as curbing the excesses of the Patriot Act, Sanders found that he could at least try to make incremental changes through the amendment process; in 2005, a Rolling Stone profile dubbed him “the amendment king.”","3242","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At home, Sanders became a symbol of Vermont’s cussed uniqueness, as affectionately regarded as a scoop of Chunky Monkey. He was reëlected to the House seven times. And his ascent to the Senate, in 2006, was stunning: he trounced the Republican candidate, Richard Tarrant, one of the wealthiest men in the state, by thirty-three percentage points. But when Sanders has run for the Vermont governorship he hasn’t done well. Jim Condon, the state legislator and former reporter, notes, “That’s telling. People here like him making a lot of noise in Washington for a little state—they’re happy to send a human hand grenade down there.” But they don’t necessarily want Sanders running the state.","3243","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Since joining the Senate, Sanders has received the most attention for his gestures of defiance—such as his marathon oration against tax cuts for the wealthiest, which was published in book form as “The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class.” Still, he has been a very active legislator. An analysis by the nonpartisan Web site GovTrack shows him tied for sixth place among senators who introduced the most bills in the 2013-14 session of Congress, and in tenth place for the number of bills that made it out of committee. The site also noted that he tends to gather co-sponsors for his bills only among Democrats.","3244","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Yet Sanders has proved himself capable of bipartisan dealmaking. In the 2013-14 session, he was the chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and though he did not serve in the military—and typically opposes military interventions—he has been a strong advocate for veterans. Last year, he worked with an unlikely ally, the Arizona Republican John McCain, to hammer out a compromise to reform the ailing V.A. health system. The bill provided five billion dollars in additional funding to hire and train new medical staff, made it easier to dismiss V.A. officials for incompetence, and allowed veterans to go outside the system if the wait for a doctor was too long. Sanders explained to reporters that it was far from the bill he would have devised on his own: “It opens up a fear of privatization, which I strongly, strongly am opposed to.” But he sounded pleased with his ball-passing skills: “When you become chairman, you can’t just say, ‘This is the way I want it.’ ”","3245","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"McCain, in turn, expressed respect for his unlikely partner, telling the Huffington Post, “Negotiating with Bernie was not a usual experience, because he is very passionate and he and I are both very strong-willed people, and we spend a lot of time banging our fists on the table and having the occasional four-letter word. But at the end of the day Bernie was result-oriented.”","3246","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders is proud of a few other Senate deals. He successfully made an amendment to the Affordable Care Act which allotted eleven billion dollars for community-health centers to provide primary care regardless of patients’ ability to pay. And, he said, he had done “everything I could do to stop the Republicans—and, sadly, the President and a few Democrats—from cutting Social Security, through the chained C.P.I.” The chained C.P.I., a different way of calculating the annual cost-of-living increases in Social Security, would likely have lowered the increases for most people, and Obama proposed adopting it in his 2014 budget. Sanders helped lead the opposition, and the President recently stopped pushing for the proposal. “It was a tough fight,” Sanders said. “But now, as a result of a lot of grassroots activism, the debate is about expanding Social Security rather than about cutting it.”","3247","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Could Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination, let alone the Presidency? It is unlikely, for one of the reasons that he’s running for President: money dominates the electoral system. By October 1st, Clinton had raised more than a hundred million dollars, much of it from Super pacs and big donors. Sanders, who refuses to take money from Super PACs, had raised forty-one million dollars, mostly in donations of less than two hundred dollars each. These totals leave him at a major disadvantage. Still, his haul is impressive, and in the most recent fund-raising cycle donations to his campaign were neck and neck with Clinton’s: between July and October, he raised twenty-six million dollars to her twenty-eight million.","3248","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"It’s impressive, too, that in a recent YouGov/CBS News poll Sanders is leading Clinton by twenty-two percentage points in New Hampshire and ten in Iowa. But the picture in South Carolina is quite different: there Clinton is twenty-three points ahead. That comparison highlights a key distinction between white and nonwhite Democrats. The New Hampshire and Iowa Democratic samples included too few nonwhite voters to break out. But among black Democrats in South Carolina Clinton leads, at fifty-two per cent; Sanders is at four per cent. Nationally, the comparable figures are fifty-seven per cent to ten per cent. And though Sanders quickly modified his platform to accommodate Black Lives Matter activists, he still has a long way to go to win over African-American voters. Latino voters are similarly unfamiliar with him: a Gallup poll released in late August showed that only twenty-five per cent knew of him, and those who did were almost evenly divided between favorable and unfavorable impressions. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released in September shows that, if Biden were in the race, he would attract more nonwhite voters than Sanders (though substantially fewer than Clinton).","3249","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Nor is Sanders’s trajectory likely to mirror that of Obama in 2008. Sanders supporters like to point out that, in the summer of 2007, Obama was polling behind Hillary Clinton among black Democrats. But, as Michael Tesler, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, recently noted in the Washington Post, Obama enjoyed much higher favorability ratings among black Democrats than Sanders does now.","3250","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders’s commitment to recapturing some of the white working-class males that the Democratic Party lost in the Reagan years won’t necessarily help his candidacy; indeed, it could hurt his quest to connect with minority voters. As he’s found, emphasizing class over race can get a progressive in trouble. Although he’s committed to immigration reform and creating a path to citizenship, he sees an ulterior motive in some approaches to the former. “There is a reason why Wall Street and all of corporate America likes immigration reform,” he said at an event held by the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in July. “It is not, in my view, that they are staying up nights worrying about undocumented workers in this country. What I think they are interested in is seeing a process by which we can bring low-wage labor of all levels into this country, to depress wages in America.”","3251","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Angelica Salas, an immigration-rights organizer in Los Angeles, whose group was represented onstage at a Sanders rally there in August, told me that she finds the immigration platform of one of his rivals—Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland—to be more “detailed, robust, and impressive.” Latino voters, she said, had been disappointed in Obama’s immigration policy and were looking for candidates who were committed to reform: “For a long time, it was almost like having an affair with the Democratic Party—they say they love you, but they don’t want to be seen with you in public.”","3252","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Yet Sanders is doing well enough to concern the Clinton team, and that creates its own challenges. Garrison Nelson said of Clinton, “She’s not worried about Bernie. But she is worried about the Bernie effect—which is to demonstrate her relative weaknesses as a candidate. He hits at her Achilles’ heel, which is authenticity.”","3253","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"On the trail, Clinton has avoided mention of him; Sanders, for his part, emphasizes their policy differences. He voted against the war in Iraq; she voted for it. He has opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership; she has voiced support for those pacts. But he has rebuked reporters for pressing him to say more about Clinton herself. In a video made backstage at a rally in Iowa, he complained, “Time after time, I’m being asked to criticize Hillary Clinton. That’s the sport that you guys like. . . . I’ve known Hillary Clinton for twenty-five years. I like her. I respect her. I disagree with her on a number of issues. No great secret.”","3254","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders appears to be sticking with that approach. But the Clinton campaign may be testing out a more aggressive strategy. Correct the Record, a Super PAC backing Clinton, recently sent an e-mail to the Huffington Post suggesting that Sanders shared many views with the controversial new British Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, then noting that Corbyn had called the death of Osama bin Laden a tragedy. Correct the Record has also sent trackers—operatives who tape rival candidates, looking for gaffes—to Sanders events.","3255","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"Sanders has promised not to run for President as an Independent in the general election, saying that he doesn’t want to have any role in handing victory to a Republican. But, even if he fails to secure the Democratic nomination, he has exposed a deep indignation about the distribution of wealth which other candidates cannot ignore. Sanders often says that he is not that far outside the mainstream—that a majority of Americans agree with him on many of his tenets. According to a recent CBS News/New York Times poll, sixty-six per cent of Americans feel that “money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed”; seventy-one per cent favor raising the minimum wage, at least slightly; and seventy-four per cent believe that corporations exert too much influence on American politics and life. Other recent surveys show that strong majorities oppose any cuts in Social Security and support workers’ rights to unionize. A Gallup poll in May concluded that nearly half of Americans are “strong redistributionists, in the sense that they believe the distribution of wealth and income is not fair, and endorse heavy taxes on the rich as a way of redistributing wealth.”","3256","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"It’s hard to see, though, how these sentiments could be translated into policy in the U.S. Many, if not most, voters would likely resist paying more taxes to make such sweeping reforms possible. The American electorate seems to respond simultaneously to calls for redistributive justice and the rejection of the entity most likely to accomplish it: the federal government. And many voters might feel that matters of economic fairness are trumped by such social issues as abortion and guns.","3257","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"In mid-September, Sanders spoke before the weekly convocation attended by the student body at Liberty University, the evangelical school in Lynchburg, Virginia, founded by the Reverend Jerry Falwell. Unlike many liberal élites, Sanders does not seem to prefer talking to people who share his views; because he is not an especially convivial person, he does not require conviviality from others. Sanders relishes the opportunity to enter enemy territory, where he believes that he can find secret allies.","3258","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"
"At Liberty, he began by acknowledging that his positions on women’s reproductive rights and gay marriage are strongly at odds with the views of many evangelical Christians. He did not make knowing jokes about these differences: as usual, Sanders was dead serious. The students were poker-faced but polite. He sought common ground by adding new valences to one or two of his standard arguments. When he called for federally mandated, paid family leave to bring America in line with the rest of the world, he dwelled a little on the preciousness of the bond between mother and baby. He was rewarded with applause. But the occasion also played to the prophetic side of Sanders—the register in which he can sound like an Old Testament preacher. Unlike his slicker rivals, Sanders is most at ease talking about the moral and ethical dimensions of politics. “We are living in a nation and in a world—the Bible speaks to this issue—in a nation and in a world which worships not love of brothers and sisters, not love of the poor and the sick, but worships the acquisition of money and great wealth.” His voice broke—all those stump speeches had been leaving deep scratches on the record. But his outrage was unmuffled. Staring at the crowd, he quoted the Hebrew Bible, his fist punctuating nearly every word: “Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream.” ♦","3259","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/12/the-populist-prophet"

"When Jeb Bush launched his campaign for President, in June, most of the attention paid to his political branding focussed on his folksy logo, which featured his first name alone, in Target red, followed by an exclamation point. But, at the same time, Bush also débuted his campaign’s hashtag, #AllInForJeb, which serves as his digital message, rallying cry, and women’s vintage-T-shirt slogan. With it, Bush, the former governor of Florida, was asking his volunteers to go “all in” in support of his candidacy, and suggesting by association that, in contrast with his previous flirtations with running for the White House, he would be fully engaged with the task this time, too.","September 7, 2015","3262","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"In American usage, the phrase “all in” began as a colloquial expression meaning to be in a bad spot—exhausted, worn out, and spent. In the game of poker, it refers to the moment when a player—whether out of bravado, recklessness, or desperation—bets all of his or her chips on a single hand. Thanks to the Texas Hold’em craze of the nineteen-nineties and two thousands, and the public’s appetite for new forms of dramatic hyperbole, the poker version of the phrase crossed over to general use and, along the way, became denuded to the point of near meaninglessness. Whereas “all in” once referred to a scenario in which someone either wins a hand or loses everything in a flash, now it means that a person is simply generally enthusiastic or fully committed. It’s everywhere these days—business jargon, marketing catch phrases, sports mantras, and the idioms of religion and self-help.","3263","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"The all-in moment in poker is a thrilling win-or-lose-everything crisis of dramatic clarity: you’ve wagered all you’ve got, giving your fate over to the cards, and you can’t go back out again. Going all in is often a spectacularly bad idea. But in life, it seems, it is all good—the only way to live boldly is to be all in on many different things at once.","3264","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"“All in” has become especially popular in the language of politics. It’s the title of Chris Hayes’s talk show on MSNBC and Paula Broadwell’s ill-fated biography of David Petraeus, the former director of the C.I.A. The phrase gets tossed into headlines every time a politician decides to try to do something. In just the past year, President Obama has been said to have been all in on free trade, climate change, and criminal-justice reform. In April, the Washington Post reported that Hillary Clinton had gone “all-in on gay marriage.” In May, Clinton was, according to MSNBC, going “all in on immigration reform.” In July, Fusion said that Bernie Sanders was going “all-in on the $15 minimum wage.” A few weeks ago, Salon argued that Donald Trump had gone “all in on right’s latest insanity.” More recently, NBC News announced that Jeb Bush, true to his hashtag promise, was planning to go “all in against Donald Trump.” In Iowa, Bush was asked by a reporter if he really was all in on the caucuses there. Yes, Bush said, he was all in.","3265","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"None of these statements, of course, are true. Modern politicians have not, all of a sudden and all at once, become incredible risk-takers—betting their entire legacies or campaigns on a particular issue or strategy. It’s difficult to think of any moment in history when a politician has actually gone all in. (Though it’s probably safe to say that Abraham Lincoln went all in on restoring the Union.) If Hillary Clinton’s policy on immigration or Bernie Sanders’s support of a higher minimum wage turn out to be unpopular with voters, they won’t suddenly have to quit the race. Jeb Bush won’t drop out if he loses in Iowa. And the stakes of the election for Bush are several notches below his campaign’s rhetoric. If he loses, he’ll go back to sitting on corporate boards and being the son of one President and the brother of another.","3266","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"Many of poker’s words and phrases are tinged with a kind of roguish romance and drama that we hope may rub off on the more mundane activities of normal life—upping the ante, stacking the deck, calling a bluff, putting your cards on the table. In terms of politics, there is an obvious benefit, for both elected officials and the people who cover them, in making the business of government sound more dangerous or dashing than it really is—riskier and more headless, more heroic, more “mavericky.” Politicians become prizefighters or gunslingers or gamblers; elections are fights or showdowns or high-stakes card games. “All in” makes every event sound like a decisive, dramatic turning point that provides instant, unambiguous resolution. But politics isn’t really like a poker game. And neither is life. As a phrase, “all in” is troublesome because it is almost always just an exaggeration, if not an outright falsehood. The free-climber Alex Honnold goes all in when he climbs vertical rock faces without a rope. Jeb Bush and the rest of us are doing something else.","3267","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"In poker, being all in is a lonely place to be. But elsewhere, “all in” is used to evoke inclusiveness and community, as in, “we’re all in this together.” In 2006, when Alex Rodriguez wanted to assure Yankees fans that the team was serious about winning, he said, “To use a poker term, we’re all in. This is the most urgent we’ve been. It’s going to be exciting.” (The Yanks didn’t win the World Series that season, but the players still got paid and weren’t compelled to retire.) The phrase was still unusual enough that Rodriguez felt the need to offer a bit of context. By now, it has joined the ignoble ranks of the sports cliché. Last spring, as the Cleveland Cavaliers began their playoff run in the N.B.A., fans were exhorted to go all in for LeBron James and their home-town team, which in turn would go all in for them. Cleveland was a family, drawn together and dreaming big. Let’s hope that there weren’t many gamblers in Cleveland who took the suggestion seriously and bet the farm on the Cavs in the Finals. They lost in six games to the Golden State Warriors.","3268","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"For Bush, #AllInForJeb suggests that same idea of community, of people coming together for a common purpose. But, right now, it appears that Bush is all in all by himself. As he languishes in single digits among the Republican field following a few months of tepid campaigning, it is difficult to picture some young volunteer out there putting everything on the line to help elect the third member of the Bush family to the White House. As the Times put it in a recent editorial, “Mr. Bush has been angering to many, boring to many others, inspiring to none.” It is hard to think of a candidate who is, at this point, less in than Jeb Bush. If the trouble continues, he might need to take courage from his campaign hashtag, and really try something desperate.","3269","http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/going-all-in-on-all-in"
"One recent morning at the Jefferson Hotel, in Washington, D.C., Peter Wehner, a conservative writer who served as an adviser for the past three Republican Presidents, described his party’s problems over a bowl of oatmeal. He said, “We got clobbered in 2012”—the fifth Presidential election out of the past six in which the Republican candidate lost the popular vote. “There’s a demographic problem. White votes are going down two points every year. We’re out of touch with the middle class.” Mitt Romney—whose very hair embodies wealthy privilege—was nominated at a national convention, in Tampa, that became an Ayn Rand-style celebration of business executives, the heroic “makers.” During the campaign, Romney wrote off forty-seven per cent of the country—the “takers”—as government parasites. He went on to lose badly to President Barack Obama, whom Republicans had regarded as an obvious failure, a target as vulnerable as Jimmy Carter. In the shock of that defeat, Wehner said, some conservatives realized that “there was a need for a policy agenda that reaches the middle class.” He added, “This was not a blinding insight.”","3270","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"A generation ago, Democrats lost five of six Presidential elections; in 1992, Bill Clinton, calling himself a New Democrat, ended the streak. Clinton didn’t repudiate the whole Democratic platform—government activism on behalf of ordinary Americans remained the Party’s core idea—but he adopted positions on issues like crime and welfare that were more closely aligned with the views of the majority, including some rank-and-file Democrats. The message, Wehner said, was as much symbolic as substantive: “ ‘We’re not a radical party; we’ve sanded off our rougher edges, and you can trust me.’ ” He went on, “The hope for some of us was that our candidate in 2016 would be the Republican version of Clinton”—a conservative reformer who, having learned from past defeats, championed economic policies that placed Republicans on the side of the hard-pressed, including non-white Americans, the soon-to-be majority.","3271","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"For fresh ideas, such a candidate had only to turn to a group of Republican thinkers who call themselves “reformocons,” of whom Wehner is a leader. Last year, the reformocons published a pamphlet of policy proposals called “Room to Grow,” on health care, education, taxes, entitlements, and other topics. In an introduction, Wehner writes, “Americans do not have a sense that conservatives offer them a better shot at success and security than liberals. For that to change, conservatives in American politics need to understand constituents’ concerns, speak to those aspirations and worries, and help people see how applying conservative principles and deploying conservative policies could help make their lives better.”","3272","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The essays don’t upend Republican orthodoxy. They argue that government should intervene on behalf of poor and middle-income Americans, but in ways that apply market principles to public policy, taking power away from Washington and giving individuals more options. Some proposals are familiar: school choice, health-care savings accounts. Others are more daring—for example, having college education underwritten by private investors, then repaid over the next decade as a predetermined percentage of graduates’ earnings. A few ideas, such as a wage subsidy that would increase the pay of workers making less than forty thousand dollars a year, building on the Earned Income Tax Credit, could easily garner bipartisan support.","3273","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Room to Grow” contains a striking description of the American economic landscape: children born into poverty with little chance of escaping it, and middle-class families overwhelmed by the rising costs of health care and education while their incomes stay flat. It’s not that different from the story that Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Massachusetts senator, tells. After years of ignoring these stark realities—or of blaming big government, in the spirit of Ronald Reagan—some Republicans have begun to sound more like Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt.","3274","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"The reformocon project shows how extreme mainstream conservatism has become in its opposition to anything involving the state. The reformocons court right-wing censure simply by acknowledging that the middle class is under pressure, and that government has a role to play beyond cutting taxes. The reckless, and ultimately doomed, shutdown of the federal government by congressional Republicans, in October, 2013, precipitated the first conference of reformocons, in Middleburg, Virginia, and that led to “Room to Grow.”","3275","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"When the 2016 Presidential campaign began, an organizer of the conference, April Ponnuru, became a policy adviser to Jeb Bush. Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, read an essay by Wehner and Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in the Bush White House, titled “A Conservative Vision of Government,” and expressed approval to an aide. Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, sought policy advice from several reformocons, including Yuval Levin, who, as editor of the quarterly National Affairs, is the group’s foremost intellectual. Earlier this year, Rubio published a book, “American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,” interwoven with the personal stories of struggling Floridians. Most of the policy ideas came directly from “Room to Grow,” a debt that Rubio acknowledged effusively.","3276","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"To the reformocons, the Republican Presidential race appeared to be stocked with candidates who were eager to take the Party into the twenty-first century. “I thought it was a group of people who would make that case,” Wehner said.

"Donald Trump’s campaign first attracted attention, in the press and among Republican voters, when he disparaged Mexican immigrants. Since he entered the race, in June, slurs and feuds have been the mainstay of his media image. Less widely discussed are his positions on working- and middle-class concerns like trade, taxes, and entitlements. In his scattershot, get-out-of-my-way fashion, Trump has vowed to rewrite trade deals involving China, impose tariffs on the products of American companies that send manufacturing overseas, leave Social Security and Medicare alone, and raise taxes on hedge-fund managers. (“I want to save the middle class. The hedge-fund guys didn’t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.”) To the reformocons’ dismay, Trump has commandeered their target audience and tainted their high-minded proposals.","3278","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Trump’s popularity isn’t based on ideology. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he draws about evenly from Republicans who consider themselves “moderate to liberal,” “somewhat conservative,” and “very conservative.” More than anything, Trump supporters are defined by class: non-college-educated whites favor him at twice the rate of those with college degrees. Trump is attracting the very blue-collar Americans whom the reformocons were aiming to bind to the Republican Party. So far, at least, these voters, many of them angry and alienated, aren’t listening to the “Room to Grow” crowd. They’re thrilling to madder music.","3279","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Working-class whites remain the most coveted demographic in American politics, even as they shrink as a percentage of the electorate. Ever since Ronald Reagan became President, Democrats have worried about their declining share of this vote. In 2012, Obama captured just thirty-six per cent of white voters without college degrees, down three per cent from 2008—partly owing to the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act, and skewed by Obama’s abysmal numbers among white Southerners. The emergence of the reformocons shows that more thoughtful Republicans have also grown concerned about the allegiance of the Party’s presumed base.","3280","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Last year, a Gallup poll found that forty-five per cent of Republicans think that the rich should pay more in taxes. Another poll, by the Pew Research Center, showed that more Republicans favor increased spending on Social Security, Medicare, education, and infrastructure than favor cutting those programs. Although government activism is anathema to conservative donors and Grover Norquist, it’s fine with a lot of Republicans making less than fifty thousand dollars a year. April Ponnuru’s husband, Ramesh, a contributor to “Room to Grow” and a senior editor at National Review, said, “Trump shows that Republican voters are not especially dogmatic conservatives—not as much as I’d like them to be.”","3281","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Reihan Salam, the executive editor of National Review, told me, “Trump is not someone I consider an ideal candidate—he does not represent my line of thinking. But he is proving that certain beliefs the professional political class had about who Republican primary voters are—what they respond to, what they care about—were just incorrect.” In 2008, Salam, along with Ross Douthat, the Times columnist, published a manifesto that presaged the reformocon movement: “Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.” Salam grew up in lower-middle-class, multi-ethnic Brooklyn. At Harvard, where he met Douthat, he became interested in wage subsidies “as a way to enhance the legitimacy of market economies,” he said. “There’s a natural marriage between a belief in a dynamic economy and a belief in solidarity and mutual trust, because the one tempers the other. Most human beings seek stability.

He points to evidence that second-generation Hispanic Americans have less faith in the country’s promise than their parents did—that the vaunted American talent for absorbing people from other places is waning under economic pressure. Salam’s idea of a national community, united by a sense of mutual obligations and a belief in legitimate institutions, evokes the type of conservatism found in Europe. Trump, meanwhile, calls to mind Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi: a strongman, a nationalist, and a nativist, who appeals to voters of limited means by tapping into their gauzy aspirations, echoing their anxieties about decline, and assuring them a secure place in a country restored to greatness.

His sustained popularity shows how contradictory and irrational the Party has become. It’s as if, in 1992, Democrats had thrown their support to Ross Perot, not Bill Clinton, because Perot—while departing from much of the Party’s basic ideology and offering only crude policy simplifications—voiced the submerged feelings of many Democrats whose presence hadn’t registered with national leaders and pundits.","3285","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"“This is like a lunar eclipse,” Wehner told me in August, when many Republicans still believed that Trump would fade by September. “The damage he’s doing—while he’s leading in the polls, that’s the face and voice of the Party, and it’s toxic.” Wehner insisted that Trump is the antithesis of real conservatism: his confidence in his ability to fix America’s problems single-handedly shows no understanding of the restraints embedded in the Constitution and the separation of powers. “In no traditional sense could you call him a conservative,” Wehner said. “Conservatism in the spirit of Madison is the idea of taking popular passions and channelling them in a constructive way. Trump is doing the opposite—he’s taking popular passions and stoking them, by demonizing the Other.” Since then, Trump’s front-runner status has been challenged by another outsider, Ben Carson, who presents even more extreme ideas, but with a whisper instead of a shout. In late September, Wehner posted an essay on the Commentary Web site called “The G.O.P. Is Killing Itself.”","3288","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Conservatism in the spirit of Madison” has almost ceased to exist. The outlook of the Republican grass roots, and of many Party leaders, is what Richard Hofstadter, writing toward the end of the McCarthy era, called “pseudo-conservative,” because “its exponents, although they believe themselves to be conservatives and usually employ the rhetoric of conservatism, show signs of a serious and restless dissatisfaction with American life, traditions, and institutions.” Republicans today have given the country conservatism in the spirit of Sarah Palin, whose ignorance about the world, contempt for expertise, and raw appeals to white identity politics presaged Trump’s incendiary campaign. So did the spectacle, in 2009, of a Republican congressman calling the President a liar during a speech Obama gave to a joint session of Congress, and Party leaders comparing Obamacare to Nazism and slavery. Earlier this year, forty-seven Republican senators wrote the Supreme Leader of Iran and declared that the President didn’t speak for the country. There have been regular threats to close the federal government in order to accomplish limited political goals. (In September, another shutdown, over the defunding of Planned Parenthood, was narrowly avoided, despite the support of nearly all the Republican Presidential candidates.) On right-wing radio, Obama is constantly accused of tyranny and treason. Once the restraints are lifted, they’re hard to restore.

"In mid-September, I travelled to a small town in southeastern New Hampshire called Raymond, where John Kasich was holding a town-hall meeting in a middle-school auditorium. Eighty chairs were arranged around a stool. One of the early arrivals was a twenty-six-year-old named Mark Lynch, who had come with his grandmother. Lynch, the son of a firefighter and a factory worker, had a crewcut and stubble, and wore a Red Sox T-shirt that exposed the tattoos on his biceps. He had just finished four years of service in the Navy and was training to be a policeman. Lynch wanted to hear what Kasich had to say, but he was more interested in the billionaire with the copper comb-over.","3290","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“Trump is tapping into this belief that politicians are self-serving,” Lynch told me. “He’s telling these donors, ‘I don’t need your money, I’ll finance my own campaign.’ If you look at what’s controlling government these days, it’s lobbyists and all these big corporations.” Lynch liked Trump’s positions on trade, taxes, and Wall Street. “People don’t want to see billionaires getting richer,” he said. “If Donald Trump, a billionaire in his own right, is saying billionaires in Washington and New York should be paying more—that says something.”","3291","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Lynch sounded a bit like a Sanders guy. When I pointed this out, his grandmother made a face. Lynch said that he couldn’t possibly vote for Sanders—“a self-proclaimed socialist from Vermont.” Lynch was a conservative, not so much on specific policies but in his values and in his ideas about America’s character. He didn’t want an overweening government creating costly programs and interfering in people’s lives. He just wanted a system that wasn’t rigged in favor of the rich and well-connected.","3292","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In Lynch’s eyes, his antipathy toward this privileged class didn’t make him an unwitting Democrat. “I don’t think Republicans are the party of big corporations and billionaires,” he said. “They’re for ordinary middle-class people.” The problem wasn’t conservatism but the dirty role of money in politics. Change would have to come at the hands of someone who wasn’t beholden to the system—a rich outsider like Trump.","3293","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich entered the room, dressed casually, all in black. At sixty-three, he’s lean and combative, with a slump in his posture and a jutting neck. He served nine terms in Congress, and, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, in the nineties, he was a key lieutenant of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and a crusader for balanced budgets. As he never fails to tell audiences, he helped craft the 1997 deal that brought surpluses to the federal government for the first time in three decades, though most of the credit belonged to a booming economy. Elected governor of Ohio in 2010, and reëlected overwhelmingly last year, Kasich turned the state’s deficits into surpluses, while cutting taxes. This is the essence of his stump speech.","3294","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"“I’m running for President ’cause I know how to land the plane,” he said, without mentioning the name of the candidate who could well crash it. “I understand that people are frustrated. My dad carried mail on his back. My mother was a blue-collar housewife. I understand anxieties about losing jobs and ringing up college debt. I know all this. But we can beat these things.” The way to beat them was to cut the deficit and say no to special interests in Washington. He offered no policy proposals to help the middle class, besides balancing the federal budget and deregulating business.","3295","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich added a dose of spiritual uplift to this starchy message. “We need to live a life bigger than ourselves,” he said. “Life is not just about me, me, me, me, me. Do you agree with that? It’s about living a life that’s bigger than yourself. . . . I am the most flawed in this room, but at least I know I give grace and every day I can start over and try to do something positive.” There’s a strain of George W. Bush’s compassionate conservatism in Kasich. (During a run for the Presidency in 2000, Kasich admitted to wishing that he’d thought up the term.) He often mentions the working poor in the same breath as the addicted and the mentally ill, as if all three groups needed charitable help. He has supported the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio, to the abhorrence of many conservatives; he likes to say that he’ll have this accomplishment in hand when St. Peter asks him what he did for the poor. “Be a center of justice and healing,” Kasich told the audience in Raymond.","3296","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

The best alternative, he felt, was Rubio. When I pointed out that Rubio was a Washington insider, Lynch sighed. “That’s the pickle I’m in, and a lot of people are in,” he said. “No matter who gets elected, it’s just going to be more of the same.

"Over the past few years, the key phrase for Democrats has been “income inequality.” The relentlessly widening gap between wealthy Americans and the rest—accelerated by the Great Recession and the not-so-great recovery—is at the heart of Sanders’s campaign, animates many of Hillary Clinton’s policies, and would make Warren an instant contender were she to enter the race. But “inequality” is a word that Republicans don’t like to use. Romney, during his Presidential campaign, characterized “inequality” as a code word: “I think it’s about envy. I think it’s about class warfare.”","3305","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"In other words, the way to think about inequality is by looking down, not up. It’s not the wealth amassed at the top but, rather, the lack of “skills, values, and habits” at the bottom that accounts for the widening income gap. Oddly, Wehner’s essay barely mentions the economic struggles of the middle class. A close look at the three middle quintiles of income, where Americans with an education, a job, and a spouse can be found treading water or sinking, would have forced him to reconsider the notion that a lack of “social capital”—as opposed to just capital—explains the entire problem.","3307","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though the reformocons recognize the difficulties of the middle class, they prefer to focus not on income disparities but on “mobility,” which describes how individuals fare across their own life span and in comparison with past generations. Levin told me that the word “growth”—the unconvincing mantra of supply-siders—was losing its hold on conservatives. When Jeb Bush predicted that his economic policies would lead to four-per-cent economic growth, a level not seen since the late nineties, the claim was either ignored or derided. “ ‘Mobility’ is much healthier,” Levin said. “It’s the right lens to talk about the economy.”","3308","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"But there’s a reason to look up as well as down the economic ladder, and it has nothing to do with envy or with punishing the rich. Economic stratification, and the rise of a super-wealthy class, threatens our democracy. Americans are growing increasingly separated from one another along lines of class, in every aspect of life: where they’re born and grow up, where they go to school, what they eat, how they travel, whom they marry, what their children do, how long they live, how they die. What kind of “national community” built on “mutual obligation” is possible when Americans have so little shared experience? The Princeton economist Alan Krueger has demonstrated that societies with higher levels of income inequality are societies with lower levels of social mobility. As America has grown less economically equal, a citizen’s ability to move upward has fallen behind that of citizens in other Western democracies. We are no longer the country where anyone can become anything.","3309","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality saps the economy by draining the buying power of Americans whose incomes have stagnated, forcing them to rely on debt to fund education, housing, and health care. At the top, it creates deep pools of wealth that have nowhere productive to go, leading to asset bubbles in capital markets bearing little or no relation to the health of the over-all economy. (Critics call this the “financialization” of the economy.) These fallouts from inequality were among the causes of the Great Recession.","3310","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Inequality is also warping America’s political system. Greatly concentrated wealth leads to outsized political power in the hands of the few—even in a democracy with free and fair elections—which pushes government to create rules that favor the rich. It’s no accident that we’re in the era of Citizens United. Such rulings give ordinary Americans the strong suspicion that the game is rigged. Democratic institutions no longer feel legitimate when they continue to produce blatantly unfair outcomes; it’s one of those insights that only an élite could miss. And it’s backed up by evidence as well as by common sense. Last year, two political scientists found that, in recent times, policy ideas have rarely been adopted by the U.S. government unless they’re favored by corporations and the wealthy—even when those ideas are supported by most Americans. The persistence of the highly unpopular carried-interest loophole for hedge-fund managers is simply the most unseemly example.","3311","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"Thus far in the campaign, the ideas of the reformocons have scarcely made an appearance among the Republican candidates. In Washington in June, Rubio—the favorite of the reformers—gave a speech to a group of them summarizing the arguments of his book. And he became the first Republican candidate to support paid family leave when, in September, he proposed a tax credit for businesses that offer their employees between four and twelve weeks off to care for newborns or sick family members. (Critics say that the tax credit wouldn’t offset enough of the costs in wages to induce companies to permit such leaves.) For the most part, though, Rubio has left the proposals in “American Dreams” on the shelf. “Rubio has the most interesting platform, but he’s not using it,” Ramesh Ponnuru said. Rubio, the son of a bartender and a maid who both emigrated from Cuba, “has established himself as the articulate, different Republican in a biographical sense,” Ponnuru added. “He’s not working to establish himself as a problem-solver. His campaign guys must be saying, ‘You have a good story, and voters aren’t interested in policy ideas.’ ”","3313","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In April, Rubio announced a tax proposal that hardly diverges from the Republican Party line. It offers families a twenty-five-hundred-dollar tax credit per child. But the proposal also reduces income taxes beyond the levels of George W. Bush’s cuts, making them even more regressive; cuts corporate taxes by ten per cent; and eliminates taxes on most investment income and inheritance. It gives a huge windfall to the rich, amounting to trillions of dollars in tax revenue. At the same time, Rubio promises to increase defense spending and pass a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Ponnuru offered an explanation for Rubio’s lapse into conventional conservative thinking: “The problem with the campaign-finance system is that it forces the candidates to spend too much time with rich people.”","3314","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Even though Rubio’s tax plan included the usual deep cuts for the wealthy, it was unacceptable to the Wall Street Journal, which criticized the child tax credit as a giveaway. Stephen Moore, the former president of the Club for Growth, explained his opposition to the columnist Albert R. Hunt: “The more you increase things like the child tax credit, the more you will move back to the 1960s and 70s tax system with higher tax rates.”","3315","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Jeb Bush, another hope of the reformocons, issued his tax plan in September. He framed it as an attempt to support social mobility and the “right to rise”—the name of his Super PAC, which, in the first half of the year, raised more than a hundred million dollars. Such rhetoric fooled some political reporters into characterizing the plan as “populist.” Though it does eliminate the carried-interest loophole, it offers the rich more than ample compensation, in the form of a large cut in income and capital-gains taxes. According to the Times, people making ten million dollars or more a year would see their effective tax rates reduced from twenty-six to twenty-one per cent, saving them an average of a million and a half dollars a year. Bush’s plan would drain up to $3.4 trillion dollars from the Treasury.","3316","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"In the end, the reformocon candidates haven’t sounded that much different from Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, and Rand Paul. All of them have had more to say about defunding Planned Parenthood, shutting down the federal government, repealing Obamacare, balancing the budget, and building a wall along the border with Mexico than about the problems of the middle class. The mantle of economic populism has essentially been handed to Donald Trump.","3317","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"At a press conference at Trump Tower on September 28th, Trump unveiled his own tax plan. “Too few Americans are working, too many jobs are being shipped overseas, and too many middle-income families cannot make ends meet,” he proclaimed. “This plan directly meets these challenges, and the challenges also of business.” What followed was a tax cut for just about everybody. Seventy-five million Americans—single people making less than twenty-five thousand dollars a year and married couples making less than fifty—would be dropped from the tax rolls altogether. But the biggest winners would be the rich: Trump would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, and would cut the rates of the top earners by fourteen per cent, below the level proposed by Bush. Even Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform blessed Trump’s plan.

The Presidential campaign felt far away—Ohio’s primary isn’t until next March—but the state remains key to the general election. “Part of it is that Trump’s an emblem of success, and the other part of it is he taps people’s anger,” Green said. “It’s not the same anger as a few years ago, when it was ‘Where are the jobs?’ Now it’s ‘Where’s our share of the American dream?’ ” Green, who does polling research on Ohio and American politics, went on, “A lot of white working-class votes are up for grabs in this election. In recent years, they’ve gone Republican, but this year the Democrats could get a slice of them.” The Republican coalition of business interests and the white working class, he said, “is under more stress this year than it’s been for a while.”","3319","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

Canton is one of those American towns where industrial decline and population loss give a sense of uninhabited space. The Hoover vacuum company, once headquartered in North Canton, was acquired in 2007 by a Hong Kong firm that moved production to Mexico and China. An abandoned brick factory is being redeveloped for white-collar service companies and apartments.

"After a winter of continuous below-zero temperatures, many of Canton’s streets crumbled, and nearly a year later they remain impassable. The Democratic mayor, William Healy, laid the blame for the city’s infrastructure woes on climate change and John Kasich. In balancing Ohio’s budget, the Governor dramatically reduced state contributions to local governments while cutting certain business taxes and eliminating the estate tax. The result, Healy said, was a loss of seventeen million dollars to Canton—twenty per cent of its revenue—bringing spending below the level of 2007. The Mayor had to choose between keeping policemen and firemen employed or repairing broken streets. “That tells you the impact of John Kasich,” he said. “But on the national front, where you’ve got Trump, Kasich comes across as a moderate! Damaging as Kasich has been to my city, as mayor, if I had to vote for a Republican for President I would vote for Kasich over the entire field.

"Around Ohio, local governments are being forced to choose between raising taxes and neglecting services, even though the state now has a two-billion-dollar “rainy-day fund.” In his stump speech in New Hampshire, Kasich claimed that his fiscal policies helped create three hundred thousand jobs. In fact, Ohio remains below its pre-recession employment rate, meaning that the state has lagged behind most of the country during the recovery. Zach Schiller, the head of research at the nonpartisan group Policy Matters Ohio, in Cleveland, told me, “Kasich’s claims to good economic performance? I don’t know if I want to say ‘deceptive,’ but they’re certainly misleading.”","3322","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"According to Policy Matters Ohio, since 2013 Kasich’s policies, including a higher sales tax and cigarette tax, have raised average annual taxes on the state’s poorest fifth by seventeen dollars, given middle-income people a ninety-four-dollar cut, and returned seventeen thousand dollars to members of the one per cent. “We’ve engineered a tax shift to lower- and middle-income Ohioans,” Schiller said. “And we’ve reduced over-all tax revenue.”","3323","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"
"Kasich’s tax policies have earned him the approval of Arthur Laffer, a native of nearby Youngstown, whose famous curve—supposedly demonstrating that lower income taxes generate higher revenue by stimulating economic growth—started the revolution in supply-side economics, forty years ago. Schiller pointed out that nothing in Ohio’s recent economic experience supports supply-side theory. The same is true nationally: growth has accelerated in periods when tax rates have been higher on top earners and stalled when rates came down. Kasich, who has positioned himself as the capable, reasonable, experienced “grownup” on the G.O.P. stage, is a supply-sider at his core. As long as Republicans cling to the warped logic of trickle-down economics, their efforts to help middle-class Americans will be largely rhetorical.","3324","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/the-republican-class-war"

"In an essay in “Room to Grow,” Yuval Levin describes what makes conservatives different from liberals. Conservatives don’t emphasize the individual and the state; they focus on the space between—where families, communities, religious groups, associations, and private enterprises create a web of interrelationships. “What happens in that space generally happens face to face—between parents and children, neighbors and friends, buyers and sellers,” he writes. “It therefore answers to immediately felt needs, and is tailored to the characters, sentiments, priorities, and preferences of the people involved.

"If there is one thing most Americans have been able to agree on over the years, it is that getting an education, particularly a college education, is a key to human betterment and prosperity. The consensus dates back at least to 1636, when the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony established Harvard College as America’s first institution of higher learning. It extended through the establishment of “land-grant colleges” during and after the Civil War, the passage of the G.I. Bill during the Second World War, the expansion of federal funding for higher education during the Great Society era, and President Obama’s efforts to make college more affordable. Already, the cost of higher education has become a big issue in the 2016 Presidential campaign. Three Democratic candidates—Hillary Clinton, Martin O’Malley, and Bernie Sanders—have offered plans to reform the student-loan program and make college more accessible.","3337","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Promoters of higher education have long emphasized its role in meeting civic needs. The Puritans who established Harvard were concerned about a shortage of clergy; during the Progressive Era, John Dewey insisted that a proper education would make people better citizens, with enlarged moral imaginations. Recently, as wage stagnation and rising inequality have emerged as serious problems, the economic arguments for higher education have come to the fore. “Earning a post-secondary degree or credential is no longer just a pathway to opportunity for a talented few,” the White House Web site states. “Rather, it is a prerequisite for the growing jobs of the new economy.” Commentators and academic economists have claimed that college doesn’t merely help individuals get higher-paying jobs; it raises wages throughout the economy and helps ameliorate rising inequality. In an influential 2008 book, “The Race Between Education and Technology,” the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz argued that technological progress has dramatically increased the demand for skilled workers, and that, in recent decades, the American educational system has failed to meet the challenge by supplying enough graduates who can carry out the tasks that a high-tech economy requires. “Not so long ago, the American economy grew rapidly and wages grew in tandem, with education playing a large, positive role in both,” they wrote in a subsequent paper. “The challenge now is to revitalize education-based mobility.”","3338","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"The “message from the media, from the business community, and even from many parts of the government has been that a college degree is more important than ever in order to have a good career,” Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at Wharton, notes in his informative and refreshingly skeptical new book, “Will College Pay Off?” (PublicAffairs). “As a result, families feel even more pressure to send their kids to college. This is at a time when more families find those costs to be a serious burden.” During recent decades, tuition and other charges have risen sharply—many colleges charge more than fifty thousand dollars a year in tuition and fees. Even if you factor in the expansion of financial aid, Cappelli reports, “students in the United States pay about four times more than their peers in countries elsewhere.”","3339","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Despite the increasing costs—and the claims about a shortage of college graduates—the number of people attending and graduating from four-year educational institutions keeps going up. In the 2000-01 academic year, American colleges awarded almost 1.3 million bachelor’s degrees. A decade later, the figure had jumped nearly forty per cent, to more than 1.7 million. About seventy per cent of all high-school graduates now go on to college, and half of all Americans between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four have a college degree. That’s a big change. In 1980, only one in six Americans twenty-five and older were college graduates. Fifty years ago, it was fewer than one in ten. To cater to all the new students, colleges keep expanding and adding courses, many of them vocationally inclined. At Kansas State, undergraduates can major in Bakery Science and Management or Wildlife and Outdoor Enterprise Management. They can minor in Unmanned Aircraft Systems or Pet Food Science. Oklahoma State offers a degree in Fire Protection and Safety Engineering and Technology. At Utica College, you can major in Economic Crime Detection.","3340","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"In the fast-growing for-profit college sector, which now accounts for more than ten per cent of all students, vocational degrees are the norm. DeVry University—which last year taught more than sixty thousand students, at more than seventy-five campuses—offers majors in everything from multimedia design and development to health-care administration. On its Web site, DeVry boasts, “In 2013, 90% of DeVry University associate and bachelor’s degree grads actively seeking employment had careers in their field within six months of graduation.” That sounds impressive—until you notice that the figure includes those graduates who had jobs in their field before graduation. (Many DeVry students are working adults who attend college part-time to further their careers.) Nor is the phrase “in their field” clearly defined. “Would you be okay rolling the dice on a degree in communications based on information like that?” Cappelli writes. He notes that research by the nonprofit National Association of Colleges and Employers found that, in the same year, just 6.5 per cent of graduates with communications degrees were offered jobs in the field. It may be unfair to single out DeVry, which is one of the more reputable for-profit education providers. But the example illustrates Cappelli’s larger point: many of the claims that are made about higher education don’t stand up to scrutiny.","3341","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"“It is certainly true that college has been life changing for most people and a tremendous financial investment for many of them,” Cappelli writes. “It is also true that for some people, it has been financially crippling. . . .The world of college education is different now than it was a generation ago, when many of the people driving policy decisions on education went to college, and the theoretical ideas about why college should pay off do not comport well with the reality.”","3342","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"No idea has had more influence on education policy than the notion that colleges teach their students specific, marketable skills, which they can use to get a good job. Economists refer to this as the “human capital” theory of education, and for the past twenty or thirty years it has gone largely unchallenged. If you’ve completed a two-year associate’s degree, you’ve got more “human capital” than a high-school graduate. And if you’ve completed a four-year bachelor’s degree you’ve got more “human capital” than someone who attended a community college. Once you enter the labor market, the theory says, you will be rewarded with a better job, brighter career prospects, and higher wages.","3343","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"There’s no doubt that college graduates earn more money, on average, than people who don’t have a degree. And for many years the so-called “college wage premium” grew. In 1970, according to a recent study by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, people with a bachelor’s degree earned about sixty thousand dollars a year, on average, and people with a high-school diploma earned about forty-five thousand dollars. Thirty-five years later, in 2005, the average earnings of college graduates had risen to more than seventy thousand dollars, while high-school graduates had seen their earnings fall slightly. (All these figures are inflation-adjusted.) The fact that the college wage premium went up at a time when the supply of graduates was expanding significantly seemed to confirm the Goldin-Katz theory that technological change was creating an ever-increasing demand for workers with a lot of human capital.","3344","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"During the past decade or so, however, a number of things have happened that don’t easily mesh with that theory. If college graduates remain in short supply, their wages should still be rising. But they aren’t. In 2001, according to the Economic Policy Institute*, a liberal think tank in Washington, workers with undergraduate degrees (but not graduate degrees) earned, on average, $30.05 an hour; last year, they earned $29.55 an hour. Other sources show even more dramatic falls. “Between 2001 and 2013, the average wage of workers with a bachelor’s degree declined 10.3 percent, and the average wage of those with an associate’s degree declined 11.1 percent,” the New York Fed reported in its study. Wages have been falling most steeply of all among newly minted college graduates. And jobless rates have been rising. In 2007, 5.5 per cent of college graduates under the age of twenty-five were out of work. Today, the figure is close to nine per cent. If getting a bachelor’s degree is meant to guarantee entry to an arena in which jobs are plentiful and wages rise steadily, the education system has been failing for some time.","3345","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"And, while college graduates are still doing a lot better than nongraduates, some studies show that the earnings gap has stopped growing. The figures need careful parsing. If you lump college graduates in with people with advanced degrees, the picture looks brighter. But almost all the recent gains have gone to folks with graduate degrees. “The four-year-degree premium has remained flat over the past decade,” the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reported. And one of the main reasons it went up in the first place wasn’t that college graduates were enjoying significantly higher wages. It was that the earnings of nongraduates were falling.","3346","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Many students and their families extend themselves to pay for a college education out of fear of falling into the low-wage economy. That’s perfectly understandable. But how sound an investment is it? One way to figure this out is to treat a college degree like a stock or a bond and compare the cost of obtaining one with the accumulated returns that it generates over the years. (In this case, the returns come in the form of wages over and above those earned by people who don’t hold degrees.) When the research firm PayScale did this a few years ago, it found that the average inflation-adjusted return on a college education is about seven per cent, which is a bit lower than the historical rate of return on the stock market. Cappelli cites this study along with one from the Hamilton Project, a Washington-based research group that came up with a much higher figure—about fifteen per cent—but by assuming, for example, that all college students graduate in four years. (In fact, the four-year graduation rate for full-time, first-degree students is less than forty per cent, and the six-year graduation rate is less than sixty per cent.)","3347","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"These types of studies, and there are lots of them, usually find that the financial benefits of getting a college degree are much larger than the financial costs. But Cappelli points out that for parents and students the average figures may not mean much, because they disguise enormous differences in outcomes from school to school. He cites a survey, carried out by PayScale for Businessweek in 2012, that showed that students who attend M.I.T., Caltech, and Harvey Mudd College enjoy an annual return of more than ten per cent on their “investment.” But the survey also found almost two hundred colleges where students, on average, never fully recouped the costs of their education. “The big news about the payoff from college should be the incredible variation in it across colleges,” Cappelli writes. “Looking at the actual return on the costs of attending college, careful analyses suggest that the payoff from many college programs—as much as one in four—is actually negative. Incredibly, the schools seem to add nothing to the market value of the students.”","3348","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"So what purpose does college really serve for students and employers? Before the human-capital theory became so popular, there was another view of higher education—as, in part, a filter, or screening device, that sorted individuals according to their aptitudes and conveyed this information to businesses and other hiring institutions. By completing a four-year degree, students could signal to potential employers that they had a certain level of cognitive competence and could carry out assigned tasks and work in a group setting. But a college education didn’t necessarily imbue students with specific work skills that employers needed, or make them more productive.","3349","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Kenneth Arrow, one of the giants of twentieth-century economics, came up with this account, and if you take it seriously you can’t assume that it’s always a good thing to persuade more people to go to college. If almost everybody has a college degree, getting one doesn’t differentiate you from the pack. To get the job you want, you might have to go to a fancy (and expensive) college, or get a higher degree. Education turns into an arms race, which primarily benefits the arms manufacturers—in this case, colleges and universities.","3350","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"The screening model isn’t very fashionable these days, partly because it seems perverse to suggest that education doesn’t boost productivity. But there’s quite a bit of evidence that seems to support Arrow’s theory. In recent years, more jobs have come to demand a college degree as an entry requirement, even though the demands of the jobs haven’t changed much. Some nursing positions are on the list, along with jobs for executive secretaries, salespeople, and distribution managers. According to one study, just twenty per cent of executive assistants and insurance-claims clerks have college degrees but more than forty-five per cent of the job openings in the field require one. “This suggests that employers may be relying on a B.A. as a broad recruitment filter that may or may not correspond to specific capabilities needed to do the job,” the study concluded.","3351","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"It is well established that students who go to élite colleges tend to earn more than graduates of less selective institutions. But is this because Harvard and Princeton do a better job of teaching valuable skills than other places, or because employers believe that they get more talented students to begin with? An exercise carried out by Lauren Rivera, of the Kellogg School of Management, at Northwestern, strongly suggests that it’s the latter. Rivera interviewed more than a hundred recruiters from investment banks, law firms, and management consulting firms, and she found that they recruited almost exclusively from the very top-ranked schools, and simply ignored most other applicants. The recruiters didn’t pay much attention to things like grades and majors. “It was not the content of education that elite employers valued but rather its prestige,” Rivera concluded.","3352","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"If higher education serves primarily as a sorting mechanism, that might help explain another disturbing development: the tendency of many college graduates to take jobs that don’t require college degrees. Practically everyone seems to know a well-educated young person who is working in a bar or a mundane clerical job, because he or she can’t find anything better. Doubtless, the Great Recession and its aftermath are partly to blame. But something deeper, and more lasting, also seems to be happening.","3353","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"In the Goldin-Katz view of things, technological progress generates an ever-increasing need for highly educated, highly skilled workers. But, beginning in about 2000, for reasons that are still not fully understood, the pace of job creation in high-paying, highly skilled fields slowed significantly. To demonstrate this, three Canadian economists, Paul Beaudry, David A. Green, and Benjamin M. Sand, divided the U.S. workforce into a hundred occupations, ranked by their average wages, and looked at how employment has changed in each category. Since 2000, the economists showed, the demand for highly educated workers declined, while job growth in low-paying occupations increased strongly. “High-skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder and have begun to perform jobs traditionally performed by lower-skilled workers,” they concluded, thus “pushing low-skilled workers even further down the occupational ladder.”","3354","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Increasingly, the competition for jobs is taking place in areas of the labor market where college graduates didn’t previously tend to compete. As Beaudry, Green, and Sand put it, “having a B.A. is less about obtaining access to high paying managerial and technology jobs and more about beating out less educated workers for the Barista or clerical job.” Even many graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—the so-called STEM subjects, which receive so much official encouragement—are having a tough time getting the jobs they’d like. Cappelli reports that only about a fifth of recent graduates with STEM degrees got jobs that made use of that training. “The evidence for recent grads suggests clearly that there is no overall shortage of STEM grads,” he writes.","3355","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Why is this happening? The short answer is that nobody knows for sure. One theory is that corporate cost-cutting, having thinned the ranks of workers on the factory floor and in routine office jobs, is now targeting supervisors, managers, and other highly educated people. Another theory is that technological progress, after favoring highly educated workers for a long time, is now turning on them. With rapid advances in processing power, data analysis, voice recognition, and other forms of artificial intelligence, computers can perform tasks that were previously carried out by college graduates, such as analyzing trends, translating foreign-language documents, and filing tax returns. In “The Second Machine Age” (Norton), the M.I.T. professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee sketch a future where computers will start replacing doctors, lawyers, and many other highly educated professionals. “As digital labor becomes more pervasive, capable, and powerful,” they write, “companies will be increasingly unwilling to pay people wages that they’ll accept, and that will allow them to maintain the standard of living to which they’ve been accustomed.”","3356","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Cappelli stresses the change in corporate hiring patterns. In the old days, Fortune 500 companies such as General Motors, Citigroup, and I.B.M. took on large numbers of college graduates and trained them for a lifetime at the company. But corporations now invest less in education and training, and, instead of promoting someone, or finding someone in the company to fill a specialized role, they tend to hire from outside. Grooming the next generation of leadership is much less of a concern. “What employers want from college graduates now is the same thing they want from applicants who have been out of school for years, and that is job skills and the ability to contribute now,” Cappelli writes. “That change is fundamental, and it is the reason that getting a good job out of college is now such a challenge.”","3357","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Obtaining a vocational degree or certificate is one strategy that many students employ to make themselves attractive to employers, and, on the face of it, this seems sensible. If you’d like to be a radiology technician, shouldn’t you get a B.A. in radiology? If you want to run a bakery, why not apply to Kansas State and sign up for that major in Bakery Science? But narrowly focussed degrees are risky. “If you graduate in a year when gambling is up and the casinos like your casino management degree, you probably have hit it big,” Cappelli writes. “If they aren’t hiring when you graduate, you may be even worse off getting a first job with that degree anywhere else precisely because it was so tuned to that group of employers.” During the dot-com era, enrollment in computer-science and information-technology programs rose sharply. After the bursting of the stock-market bubble, many of these graduates couldn’t find work. “Employers who say that we need more engineers or IT grads are not promising to hire them when they graduate in four years,” Cappelli notes. “Pushing kids into a field like health care because someone believes there is a need there now will not guarantee that they all get jobs and, if they do, that those jobs will be as good as workers in that field have now.”","3358","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"So what’s the solution? Some people believe that online learning will provide a viable low-cost alternative to a live-in college education. Bernie Sanders would get rid of tuition fees at public universities, raising some of the funds with a new tax on financial transactions. Clinton and O’Malley would also expand federal support for state universities, coupling this funding with lower interest rates on student loans and incentives for colleges to hold down costs. Another approach is to direct more students and resources to two-year community colleges and other educational institutions that cost less than four-year colleges. President Obama recently called for all qualified high-school students to be guaranteed a place in community college, and for tuition fees to be eliminated. Such policies would reverse recent history. In a new book, “Learning by Doing: The Real Connection between Innovation, Wages, and Wealth” (Yale), James Bessen, a technology entrepreneur who also teaches at Boston University School of Law, points out that “the policy trend over the last decade has been to starve community colleges in order to feed four-year colleges, especially private research universities.” Some of the discrepancies are glaring. Richard Vedder, who teaches economics at Ohio University, calculated that in 2010 Princeton, which had an endowment of close to fifteen billion dollars, received state and federal benefits equivalent to roughly fifty thousand dollars per student, whereas the nearby College of New Jersey got benefits of just two thousand dollars per student. There are sound reasons for rewarding excellence and sponsoring institutions that do important scientific research. But is a twenty-five-to-one difference in government support really justified?","3359","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Perhaps the strongest argument for caring about higher education is that it can increase social mobility, regardless of whether the human-capital theory or the signalling theory is correct. A recent study by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco showed that children who are born into households in the poorest fifth of the income distribution are six times as likely to reach the top fifth if they graduate from college. Providing access to college for more kids from deprived backgrounds helps nurture talents that might otherwise go to waste, and it’s the right thing to do. (Of course, if college attendance were practically universal, having a degree would send a weaker signal to employers.) But increasing the number of graduates seems unlikely to reverse the over-all decline of high-paying jobs, and it won’t resolve the income-inequality problem, either. As the economist Lawrence Summers and two colleagues showed in a recent simulation, even if we magically summoned up college degrees for a tenth of all the working-age American men who don’t have them—by historical standards, a big boost in college-graduation rates—we’d scarcely change the existing concentration of income at the very top of the earnings distribution, where C.E.O.s and hedge-fund managers live.","3360","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"
"Being more realistic about the role that college degrees play would help families and politicians make better choices. It could also help us appreciate the actual merits of a traditional broad-based education, often called a liberal-arts education, rather than trying to reduce everything to an economic cost-benefit analysis. “To be clear, the idea is not that there will be a big financial payoff to a liberal arts degree,” Cappelli writes. “It is that there is no guarantee of a payoff from very practical, work-based degrees either, yet that is all those degrees promise. For liberal arts, the claim is different and seems more accurate, that it will enrich your life and provide lessons that extend beyond any individual job. There are centuries of experience providing support for that notion.” ♦","3361","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus"

Dore Gold, the director-general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told Israel’s Army Radio that Netanyahu never intended to keep the deal from being approved but rather to raise awareness about its perils. “Most of Congress is against the deal,” as is Isaac Herzog, who leads the opposition in the Knesset, Gold added. He then returned to the claims that Netanyahu made in his speech before Congress in March—that the deal was bad, that it endangered Israel—which might have been mistaken for an attempt to convince American legislators to reject it.","3364","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"AIPAC’s influence was first advanced, in the nineteen-seventies, by hard-line Democratic senators like Henry Jackson and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who felt that the State Department was controlled by Eisenhower-era Republicans who were too indebted to oil interests and not adequately sympathetic to Israel’s plight. Ever since AIPAC managed to coördinate the defeat of Republican Senator Charles Percy, in 1984 (Percy was then the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and had argued that Jewish settlements preëmpt Palestinian rights), AIPAC has been able to present itself as a powerhouse, flush with money, focussed on Congress, and with strong claims on both Republican hawks and evangelicals and the Democratic center. Tom Dine and Steven Grossman, AIPAC leaders in the eighties and nineties, were Democratic operatives; Grossman went on to become the chairman of the Democratic National Committee under Bill Clinton. President Obama courted AIPAC’s support in 2008, assuring attendees of its yearly conference that Jerusalem would be “undivided.”","3365","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Israel, in AIPAC’s playbook, is the best judge of its defense needs, a sister democracy, and, besides, a strategic asset in a volatile region. (It proved this for the first time in September, 1970, when Israeli jets helped protect the Jordanian monarch from a Palestinian insurgency and Syrian invasion.) Schumer’s opposition to the Iran deal was supposed to signal that AIPAC remained influential among Democratic principals and fund-raisers, and that the man who chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2005 to 2009, and is now the favorite to lead Senate Democrats when Harry Reid retires, could still fend off challenges to Israeli policy—if, for example, the U.N. Security Council were to vote on another resolution condemning West Bank settlements. The signal, meant to be cautionary, seems rather weak.","3366","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Even if, as some claim, Schumer came out against Obama only because he knew he could not muster the votes to override a Presidential veto, he surely expected to make a better showing. Now progressive groups like MoveOn have rallied Democratic insurgents to call Schumer’s prospective Senate leadership into question. AIPAC officials know that Netanyahu is to blame for emancipating Democrats from AIPAC’s embrace. “Netanyahu’s speech in Congress made the Iranian issue a partisan one,” an AIPAC official told Israel’s Walla!News. “As soon as he insisted on going ahead with this move, which was perceived as a Republican maneuver against the President, we lost a significant part of the Democratic Party, without which it was impossible to block the agreement.” AIPAC’s efforts to exploit Herzog’s opposition to the deal were almost as counterproductive, given that the deal has the support of Israeli Army and intelligence leaders. Amos Yadlin, the man who Herzog said would have been his defense minister, had he defeated Netanyahu, said that the deal should not be opposed.* As Channel Two’s veteran analyst Amnon Abramovitch told me, “Herzog’s effort to gain some reputation for ‘security’ and lean to the center is an understandable political move. But Iran is a subject that inevitably involves Israeli-American relations, and here Herzog got messed up.”","3367","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Schumer’s declaration of guardianship is not only a political but also a personal statement, and part of how many Jewish Americans of his generation understand their secular Jewish distinctiveness. It conjures the embattled, vulnerable Jews of their parents’ generation, in what often appears to be a passion play. If there is a Netanyahu at the center of this history, it is not Benjamin, the son, but Benzion, the father, who, in the early nineteen-forties, was one of the leaders of the Revisionist Zionism movement in the U.S. and, with Hillel Kook (then known as Peter Bergson), helped found the Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe. Kook and Netanyahu publicly railed against American Jewish leaders like Rabbi Stephen Wise, who was close to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for not doing enough to raise public consciousness about the plight of European Jews. “They cannot claim, with a clear conscience, to have done everything within their power to save those condemned people,” Benzion Netanyahu wrote in 1944. “They have been too cautious, too appeasing, and too ready to swallow the meaningless statements of sympathy that were issued from high places.”","3368","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"American Jewish leaders of his son’s generation won’t make that mistake again. AIPAC’s push against the deal included a write-in campaign and a multimillion-dollar stream of television ads, under a new 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization called Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran. When Obama and the Administration’s nuclear experts appeared to be persuasive on nuclear issues, AIPAC tried to shift the conversation from Iran’s nuclear threat to its capacity, if sanctions were lifted, to fund violence in the region. (“Iran will receive up to $150 billion,” an AIPAC fact sheet warns. “Iran could then dramatically bolster its support for international terrorism.”) More and more, the Iran deal became more symbolic than strategic: if the President really cared about Israel, then he would take its side. “He accommodated radical Islamist theocrats when he should have insisted on the opposite, that the survival of Israel is non-negotiable. In effect, he betrayed the trust of the Jewish state,” Mort Zuckerman wrote even before the deal was done. In other words, as Leon Wieseltier told a reporter last month, Obama is “the first U.S. President who doesn’t really have a special feeling for Israel.”","3369","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Fortunately, that sensibility has not passed down easily to younger generations. AIPAC’s liberal rival, J Street, strongly advocated for the deal; it has an endorsement list that has grown from about two dozen candidates in 2008 to nearly a hundred for the coming election year. On the whole, Todd Gitlin and Steven M. Cohen wrote last month in the Washington Post, Jewish Americans are more likely than other Americans to support the deal. Only a fifth of Jewish Americans under forty, who are also less likely to be affiliated with synagogues and communal organizations, oppose it, according to an L.A. Jewish Journal survey from mid-July, which Cohen directed. But Jewish leaders tend to be older and more conservative than the Jewish population as a whole, as Cohen found in an earlier study, and more grounded in what the historian Salo Baron famously called the “lachrymose conception of Jewish history.”","3370","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"(Ironically, Hillel Kook, who died in 2001—and whom I knew at the end of his life—could not adjust to AIPAC’s rhetoric, either. He had returned to Tel Aviv in 1948 and sat in the first Knesset, but he rejected Likud’s evolution, including its satisfaction with a religious “Jewish state,” with which American Jews easily identified. For Kook, Zionism meant a secular “Hebrew republic,” which would have a Western-style constitution with a Bill of Rights, and exist beside a Palestinian state. He hoped Israelis would avoid what the writer Arthur Koestler called “claustrophilia.” Kook lacked, presumably, “a special feeling for Israel.”)","3371","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"
"Netanyahu wants us to believe that the fifteen-year duration of the Iran deal is a historical “blink of an eye,” as he told Congress in March. His implicit message is that he does not expect the regional status quo to significantly change: he assumes that the settlement project will continue growing, that Palestinians will remain in despair and disarray, and that ayatollahs will remain fixated on Israel. Democrats have rejected that message, but Netanyahu retains some influence over the deal’s eventual implementation. “The provisions are complex,” Steven Simon, the former senior director for Middle East and North Africa affairs in the Obama White House, told me. “Iran will exploit this, and Israeli analysts will claim cheating.” If Iran can be presented as not in compliance, it does “raise the spectre of military action,” Simon added. Still, the presumption that any Israeli government deserves the benefit of the doubt seems obsolete. In 2010, after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton complained about Netanyahu’s settlement policy, Schumer told a conservative radio host that he had persuaded three-quarters of the Senate to sign a letter “rebuking the Administration for these confrontational stances toward Israel.” Would he even attempt this today?","3372","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chuck-schumers-humiliation"

"On Friday, October 2nd, Jeb Bush was onstage at a college auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, for a public interview with Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general and a prominent figure in the right-wing firmament. Bush is sixty-two, but, thanks to a low-carb Paleo diet, he looks younger than he did when he left the Florida governor’s office eight years ago for a life in the business world. A trim physique, however, hasn’t boosted his appeal to potential voters. A new national poll showed that Bush’s support had sunk to four per cent; South Carolina, which has one of the most conservative Republican electorates in the country, and will hold its primary early next year, just after Iowa and New Hampshire, is crucial to winning the nomination. Once considered the front-runner, Bush is trailing a clutch of candidates, among them Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who have never held public office and encourage comparison to buffoons.","3374","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb has presented himself as the most electable Republican candidate: willing to break with Republican orthodoxy on domestic issues such as immigration and education, and committed to breaking, if vaguely, with his brother’s legacy on foreign policy and to being, as he has said, his “own man.” Before Bush officially entered the 2016 campaign, he remarked to a group of C.E.O.s at a conference in Washington, D.C., that a successful candidate had to be willing to “lose the primary to win the general,” and should campaign “without violating your principles.” He meant that one must avoid the perennial trap of party primaries, in which “base voters,” the hard-core conservatives, force politicians to take extreme positions that will prove unpopular in a general election and, when later disavowed, expose the candidate as a phony. “It’s not an easy task, to be honest with you,” he noted. (Hillary Clinton faces a similar problem in her race for the Democratic nomination.)","3375","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But in his conversation with Wilson, and in a subsequent interview with me and other reporters, Bush veered toward the right. On domestic affairs, his view was neatly summarized by his answer to a question about gun control. It was the day after the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, and yet Bush rejected any calls for new legislation. He noted that he had confronted similar pressure for government action after tragedies while he was governor: “Look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”","3376","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush was pilloried by Democrats for his “stuff happens” remark, but he defended it, telling me that the government doesn’t have a solution to every problem, and that sometimes government action makes matters worse. Some variety of a laissez-faire philosophy is standard for modern Republicans, at least on most domestic issues. But, increasingly in recent months, Bush, like a number of his colleagues, has been making the case for aggressive intervention abroad. Two days earlier, Russia had carried out its first air strikes in Syria. When I asked Bush how he would respond if he were President, he said that it was the lack of American action that had created the dire situation in Iraq and Syria, and invited the Russian military to bolster the Assad regime.","3377","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I think we need to stand up to Putin, not just as it relates to Syria,” Bush told me. “This sends a signal all around the world of the United States pulling back, not being serious. Our allies don’t believe that we’re going to have their back. And this emboldens our enemies.” Bush offered no details on how to “stand up to Putin” or what, exactly, he would do to pacify the killing floor of the Middle East and South Asia and reconcile the tangled rivalries and interests there. But his message to the base was clear: We must do something. And we must do it now.","3378","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Bush’s view represents a return to a simplistic interventionism that seemed discredited in the wake of the Iraq debacle. For decades, the G.O.P. has been split into two camps. The realists, who dominated the Presidency of Bush’s father, George H. W. Bush, emphasized diplomacy and coalitions over go-it-alone displays of force, and a skepticism about America’s ability to shape the internal dynamics of foreign countries. They also expressed a willingness to tolerate tyrannical regimes that advance U.S. interests or create greater stability in volatile regions of the world. The other camp—variously described as idealists, hawks, and neoconservatives—dominated the Presidency of Bush’s brother. They have more often called for the overthrow rather than the containment of hostile regimes, and they remain committed to exporting American-style democracy to places where it has never flourished.","3379","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The hyper-interventionist foreign policy of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney was widely blamed for the Republican Party’s loss of Congress in 2006 and of the Presidency in 2008. But many hawks, once more in full voice, now believe that the Obama years—the emergence of ISIS, the crisis in Syria and Iraq, Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, the rise of Putin at a time of Russian isolation and economic weakness—have vindicated Bush. “Any Presidential candidate, the first thing he or she needs to do is put up a map of the Middle East in 2009 and one today,” John McCain, a leading hawk in the Senate, told me, as we discussed foreign policy in his office. “And point out that it is this President’s failures. He said he got out of conflicts. He got out of conflicts, but the conflicts didn’t end.”","3380","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama thinks that intractable foreign-policy crises should be guided by the physician’s maxim of “first, do no harm”—or, as his aides have said privately, “Don’t do stupid shit.” To Republican hawks, this sounds like a willful and dangerous abdication of American power and influence. Lindsey Graham, who is one of the long-shot Presidential candidates and McCain’s closest ally in the Senate, has called for ten thousand American troops to be sent back to Iraq. Last week, Chris Christie said that he would set up a no-fly zone in the Syrian airspace in which the Russians are now operating, and shoot down any planes that entered it.","3381","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But of all the Republican candidates vying to reform the world of foreign affairs only one belongs to a family of Presidents that, for better or worse, did so much to give that world its present shape. When Jeb Bush began his campaign, he enlisted as advisers some of the realists from his father’s camp, including the former Secretary of State James Baker. But the heaviest contingent consisted of his brother’s liege men: Paul Wolfowitz, the Defense Department official who made the ideological case for invading Iraq; John Hannah, who had been an adviser to Dick Cheney and pushed bad intelligence into Colin Powell’s famous speech at the U.N. making the case for war; Porter Goss, the former C.I.A. director who condoned waterboarding as an interrogation technique; and Stephen Hadley, the former national-security adviser, who took the blame for false assertions that President Bush made about nuclear yellowcake allegedly sought by Saddam Hussein from Niger.","3382","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Another adviser on his team is Otto Reich, who served in various foreign-policy roles in the Reagan Administration and in both Bush Administrations, and is perhaps best known for his participation in the 2002 attempted coup against Hugo Chávez, the late socialist leader of Venezuela. (Reich denies that he or the U.S. played any role in the coup.) In May, Jeb Bush, after providing a series of confusing responses on the issue, said that, given what is now known about the condition of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear-, biological-, and chemical-weapons program in 2003, he would not have invaded Iraq. Not all of his advisers share this sentiment.","3383","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I can defend the invasion of Iraq,” Reich told me. “What did the invasion of Iraq do? It caused all of the people who would’ve otherwise come and attacked us and killed Americans on our soil—it caused them to go to Iraq and die there. That may sound very brutal, or whatever, but we have seen what has happened when you have an Administration like the current one, that did not realize what Bush had done; sent the troops home from Iraq; created a vacuum that was filled by ISIS. And they’re killing Americans and everyone else—they’re mostly killing Muslims. I lay that at the feet of the Obama Administration.”","3384","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He added, “All Republicans say what I just did . . . but it’s not reported. Nobody listens. It goes against conventional wisdom. Conventional wisdom is that Bush was a failure in foreign policy, because of Iraq. Well, history is beginning to tell a different story.”","3385","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"The American public’s appetite for military interventions runs in cycles. After the triumph of the Second World War, policymakers were emboldened to roll back Communism, but the miasma of Vietnam instilled a wariness of major overseas military entanglements that spanned the Carter and Reagan Presidencies. In 1991, the relatively quick and successful Gulf War sparked a new bipartisan consensus that American force could again be deployed wisely if it was undertaken with overwhelming strength and with the benefit of an international coalition. The lack of intervention in Rwanda was widely seen as a moral calamity for which politicians, including Bill Clinton, have apologized.","3386","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"That uneasy consensus lasted through the 2001 toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the invasion of Iraq in 2003 came to be seen as such a catastrophic mistake that even its progenitor could not avoid casting blame on his own circle. George W. Bush, during his last two years in office, forced out Donald Rumsfeld and marginalized Dick Cheney. It was too late to save his own popularity. When voters went to the polls in November, 2008, Bush’s job-approval rating dipped to twenty per cent, the lowest of any outgoing President in the history of polling.","3387","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Voices of restraint can still be heard in the Party’s debates, including on Jeb Bush’s team. One adviser, in contrast to Reich, told me, “I’m sure he’s not going to invade Iraq again. We did that one. You can’t compare him to his brother, because his brother was operating in a different environment. We had just been attacked; we didn’t know what was coming next.”","3388","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Senator Lindsey Graham, whose candidacy is essentially limited to a hard-line foreign policy, said his opponents were trying to sort out the politics of interventionism. “Here’s the problem,” he said, “Republicans know it’s not popular to be for Obama’s foreign policy, but they’re nervous about how far to go. They’re trying to find out where the public is, and trying to take the public’s pulse.

"Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, who is also running for President, told me that he thinks he’s found it: a foreign policy that channels Reagan, by far the most popular Republican in modern history. In Cruz’s Senate office, we sat under an enormous painting depicting Ronald Reagan’s 1987 speech at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, in which he declared, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”","3390","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz is forty-four, eighteen years younger than Jeb Bush. Other politicians of his generation, including Marco Rubio, also forty-four, were strongly influenced by 9/11, but Cruz told me that he draws more lessons from Reagan’s fight against Communism than from Bush’s and Obama’s fight against terrorism. “The foreign-policy events that shaped my world view the most did not occur in the past two Presidencies,” he said. “I believe in peace through strength. It’s worth underscoring. Reagan went through eight years in the Presidency, and the biggest country he ever invaded was Grenada.”","3391","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He emphasized that “among Republicans there is a spectrum of views of foreign policy. At one end, there is Rand Paul”—a non-interventionist who is the most skeptical of further involvement in Syria and Iraq. “At the other end, I would put John McCain. Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio are very similar to McCain. I would describe my views as a third point on the triangle.” He believes that “America should always be a clarion voice of liberty, and that the bully pulpit of the Presidency has enormous power. There is power to speaking the truth on a global stage.” He added, “However, speaking for freedom is not the same thing as using U.S. military force. Historically, America has always been reluctant to engage in military force.”","3392","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Reagan’s foreign policy was rhetorically idealistic but also deeply pragmatic. Although he described the Soviet Union as “the evil empire,” he was quick to negotiate with Gorbachev. Soon after Hezbollah attacked the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, in 1983, killing two hundred and forty-one Americans, Reagan said that a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon would send a “signal to terrorists everywhere: they can gain by waging war against innocent people.” But then he did it anyway, after concluding that the troops’ mission was unclear and that their presence offered too inviting a target to extremists.","3393","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This strain of pragmatism was powerful enough that George W. Bush called for a “humble” foreign policy in his 2000 campaign, and condemned the kinds of democracy-building interventions for which he would later become known. Cruz strives to return the G.O.P. to its pre-9/11 philosophy. “If and when U.S. military force is required,” he told me, “it should, No. 1, always be to directly further the vital national security of the United States. No. 2, we should use overwhelming force. And, No. 3, we should get the heck out. It should not be the objective of our armed forces to engage in nation-building, to transform foreign nations into robust, utopian democracies.”","3394","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"While many Republicans now criticize Obama for not doing enough in Syria, Cruz was among those who opposed Obama’s 2013 request to strike Syria. “He repeatedly tried to justify this as ‘vindicating international norms,’ or as ‘the violation of international law,’ ” Cruz said. “It’s not the job of our military to behave like a law professor in a faculty lounge, vindicating international law. It’s the job of our military to protect the safety and security of three hundred and thirty million Americans.” He said that although “Assad is a monster” who “has used poison gas” and “killed hundreds of thousands of his own citizens,” he worries about what might happen “if the attack succeeds and you topple Assad, and the weapons then fall into the hands of Al Qaeda or Al Nusra or ISIS or any of the other radical Islamic terrorists.” (Donald Trump has said that he’s happy to have Russia in Syria fighting ISIS, though he failed to note that, so far, Russia has been mainly targeting U.S.-trained rebels, not ISIS.)","3395","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz added that the military commanders he has consulted insist that “the most potent tool to use against ISIS is overwhelming airpower.” He maintained that arming the Kurds in northern Iraq was a better alternative to sending U.S. troops. “We need boots on the ground, but they don’t necessarily need to be American boots,” he said. “The Kurds are our boots on the ground.”","3396","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But Cruz’s prescription may be more like Reagan’s supply-side tax cuts than like Reagan’s foreign policy: it promises enormous benefits with very little sacrifice. Graham, who wants American troops to lead the fight, scoffed at Cruz’s argument. “The Kurds don’t have any offensive capability,” he said, pointing out that Shiites and non-Kurdish Sunnis in Iraq and Syria would be as concerned about Kurdish advances as they are about ISIS. “They’re not gonna go down to Ramadi! Go ask the Kurds, ‘Would you help us liberate Syria?’ And they’d say, ‘Thank you, but no thank you.’ If you want to create a war to end all wars, have a marauding band of Kurds going through the Middle East.”","3397","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Cruz has calculated that, despite the rise of ISIS, Republican voters are still hungover from the costly interventions of the Bush years, and that they share his skepticism about the ability of American troops to accomplish much in Iraq and Syria. “There are some politicians in Washington who approach foreign military action as if they’re playing Risk,” he said. “They want to deploy troops and command them in battle.” He added, “A number of politicians treat American boots on the ground as a talisman to demonstrate that they’re really tough.”","3398","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Obama, who has said that he was elected to end wars, not start them, has bombed more countries than George W. Bush did. But in fighting terrorism he has chosen to use drones and other forms of airpower, Special Forces, and proxy armies. Obama was skeptical about intervening to stop Muammar Qaddafi’s forces as they marched on a helpless population in Benghazi, Libya. He had to be talked into the operation by, among others, Hillary Clinton, and the result—a failed state in Libya that has created a haven for terrorists—shaped his skepticism about intervening in Syria.","3399","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Early on, key Republicans seemed to endorse Obama’s cautious approach. When Marco Rubio ran for the Senate in 2010, he supported Obama’s drawdown of troops in Iraq. As a former city commissioner in West Miami and then a state legislator, Rubio knew the foreign-policy issues that important Florida constituencies care about, such as the Jewish community’s staunchly pro-Israel views and the Cuban-American community’s fierce opposition to Castro. He had little experience with broader foreign-policy questions. In his early months in Congress, he supported attempts at diplomacy with Iran. During the 2013 fight over budget cuts, Rubio advocated for government-spending reform. He has since grown less cautionary, arguing for an increase in military spending and calling it the “most important obligation of the federal government.”","3400","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, who was a leader in the Florida House while Jeb Bush was governor and is now his nearest opponent in the race, though they are both well behind Trump and Carson in most national polls, has recently positioned himself as one of the most hawkish Republicans running for President. McCain noted that Rubio, like others, had shifted into his camp after the emergence of ISIS, and he joked that Rubio has a history of switching positions, which McCain gently mocked by licking his finger and holding it in the air.","3401","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Recently, Rubio told me that he no longer believes that Obama’s drawdown was wise. “We are retreating from Afghanistan and Iraq, not anticipating the vacuum that would be left behind and the potential that creates for radicalism,” he said. His shift might seem political, but he suggested that it was the result of becoming immersed in issues, as a senator, to which, as a candidate, he had given little thought. He noted that some of his opponents, including Jeb Bush, have never held federal office. “I’m a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee,” Rubio said. “I spend a significant amount of time working on these issues on a daily basis. So most certainly I’m going to have more insight than someone reading briefings from the staffers.”","3402","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio’s foreign policy is a clear response to Obama’s alleged retreat from the world. The President’s biggest mistakes, in this view, were all failures to intervene more aggressively. Rubio has said that he would have forcefully taken the side of demonstrators in Iran during the 2009 Green Revolution. “The President was so intent on negotiating with Iran’s tyrants that he did little to help its people,” he remarked in a speech in Washington in 2011.","3403","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"But the key issue for many emerging Republican hawks was Obama’s failure to attack Assad when he used chemical weapons. Obama had drawn a “red line,” but then retreated. Instead, he accepted a deal negotiated with Putin to place the weapons under international control. “Everyone heard him,” Reich said. “He said, ‘I didn’t draw the red line, the world drew a red line.’ No, Mr. President, the world didn’t stand before the cameras in the White House and say that it was drawing a red line; you did. . . . It’s very dangerous.”","3404","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"George Shultz, who is ninety-four and is also a Bush adviser, was Reagan’s Secretary of State. He said that the red line was one of the biggest mistakes of Obama’s Presidency. “I don’t think the President realizes how much damage was done,” he said. “I remember when I was in marine boot camp, at the start of World War Two, and the sergeant hands me this rifle and says, ‘Take good care of this rifle—this is your best friend. Remember one thing: never point this rifle at anybody unless you’re willing to pull the trigger.’ No empty threats. That’s boot-camp wisdom. With Obama there are empty threats lying all over the place, and they undermine his credibility.”","3405","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"This outlook relies on some revisionist history. When Obama asked Congress for authorization to bomb Syria in 2013, several Republicans, Rubio among them, voted against the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others announced that they would oppose it on the Senate floor. It never came to a vote. Rubio said that the Administration’s proposed attack was not sufficiently robust; now he cites the failure to use force as the reason for much of the current chaos, including Putin’s recent involvement.","3406","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio told me that years ago he warned that the power vacuums in the Middle East were being filled by Islamic extremists, and he noted ISIS’s growing role in Afghanistan, where it had previously had little presence. “If they continue unabated a year from now, we could live in a world where ISIS is now operating in vacated spaces in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya,” he said. Rubio is a favorite of G.O.P. hawks. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas billionaire who spent some $100 million in the 2012 election and is wooed by almost every Republican candidate, is reportedly also a fan. But Rubio sounds more cautious when asked for details about how to defeat ISIS.","3407","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“Intervening doesn’t mean ground troops,” he said. “Intervening can be a lot of things.” He went on, “A full-scale invasion, sending a hundred thousand troops to Iraq right now, is probably not the best way to defeat ISIS. Because it very well may be what they hope will happen, because it will allow them to point to radicals around the world and attract more recruits and more funding. I think that the better approach is to empower Sunni tribes to defeat them. And they need a lot of help from us, including air strikes and special-op forces.”","3408","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"What Rubio laid out wasn’t very different from Obama’s current plan. When pressed, he conceded that many more American troops might be necessary. “There’s no magic number,” he said. “I don’t know if nine thousand is worse than eleven thousand. What matters is: first you have to establish a mission—what are you trying to achieve? Then you have to allow the military to come up with operations and how to achieve that mission. And that will determine the number in the mission, not the other way around.”","3409","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Rubio, Graham, and many other Republicans believe that the nation’s foreign policy suffers from timidity, not from overexertion. The problem is in the execution, not the intervention itself. “Here’s what I’ve learned,” Graham told me. “If you don’t have a plan after you take Afghanistan down, after you take Iraq down, after you take Libya down, after you take Syria down, you’re going to regret it.”","3410","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Given the failed states and the civil wars gripping Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, I asked Graham for an example of a successful intervention that would bolster his case for a more hawkish foreign policy. We were sitting outside, in Manchester, New Hampshire, and he was eating nachos. He looked at me excitedly, racing to swallow so that he could get to his answer: “How about Germany and Japan?”","3411","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Even as Bush watches his opponents solidify their foreign-policy positions, he has struggled to come to terms with his brother’s ideology. His opponents criticize him for being vague or unengaged. Graham told me, “I think he’s a work-in-progress. I think he’s been out of the game for ten years. . . . He’s gotta convince people that three Bushes are not one too many.”","3412","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Jeb Bush’s troubles began almost as soon as he declared his candidacy and included the eighty-five-year-old James Baker on his list. As Communism began to collapse, in 1989, Bush and Baker helped engineer a soft landing for the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the gradual reorientation of Europe’s Eastern Bloc countries toward the West. Hawks pilloried them for not asserting themselves strongly enough. When Bush went to Kiev, Ukraine, for instance, and warned Ukrainians not to secede from the Soviet Union, the address was mocked as the “chicken Kiev” speech. In 1991, after assembling a United Nations-backed coalition to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, Bush and Baker ignored the pleas of American neoconservatives who wanted U.S. forces to march on Baghdad and overthrow Saddam following the uprisings against his rule. They were again demonized. Wolfowitz said that it was as if America were “idly watching a mugging.” In 2006, Baker co-chaired the Iraq Study Group, which recommended a dramatic change in Bush’s policy in the Middle East, including the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq and diplomatic engagement with Iran and Syria, policies that Bush rejected.","3413","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"When Baker appeared on Jeb Bush’s list, neoconservatives expressed alarm. His foreign-policy views—diplomacy, stability, and serious doubts about interventions requiring large numbers of U.S. troops—are closer to Obama’s than to George W. Bush’s. Jeb Bush faced a revolt from donors and excoriation in neoconservative publications. A few weeks after Jeb’s announcement, Baker was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a Washington gala dinner for J Street, the liberal-leaning pro-Israel group founded in 2008 to act as a counterweight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Commentary published an article about “Jeb Bush’s James Baker Problem” and warned that Jeb may be Baker’s “kindred spirit.” Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, wrote that “Jeb Bush turns to Israel-hater, Jim Baker, for foreign policy advice.” Adelson reportedly sent word to Bush that he should pressure Baker to cancel the speech. Bush declined, and Adelson’s allies leaked that Adelson wouldn’t support Bush.","3414","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At the J Street dinner, Baker criticized Benjamin Netanyahu for “diplomatic missteps and political gamesmanship,” and spoke about his own role in the first Bush Administration’s withholding of loan guarantees to Israel in order to pressure the government to halt settlement construction. William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, called Baker “anti-Israel,” and tweeted, “Thankfully, James Baker doesn’t speak for today’s Republican Party.” Morton Klein, the president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, told Bloomberg that Bush’s association with Baker would cost the candidate: “There are many mega-donors who will not be with him because of that.”","3415","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In May, Bush appeared in New York, at the Metropolitan Club, before an audience of financiers organized by Paul Singer, a hedge-fund manager and the kind of Republican mega-donor Klein had warned about. Someone asked Bush to explain Baker’s influence on his policymaking. According to the Washington Post, Jeb “said that he respected Baker, but maintained that he is not part of his foreign-policy team.” CNN, which cited four sources and the notes of someone present, quotes Bush as saying, “What you need to know is that who I listen to when I need advice on the Middle East is George W. Bush.” The Bush campaign later insisted that Jeb was speaking narrowly about Israeli policy. Either way, the message was clear: the hawks were back in control of Republican foreign policy.","3416","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Lately, in his effort to be his “own man,” Bush has displayed a willingness to move even further to the right than his brother. At the October 2nd interview in South Carolina, Wilson asked him about the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay. During George W. Bush’s tenure, the prison became such a source of shame for America that even Bush, who was loath to acknowledge mistakes or to bow to international pressure, said in 2007, “It should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantánamo.” Jeb disagrees. Wilson asked if Guantánamo prisoners should be moved to maximum-security facilities in the U.S. “No,” Jeb said. “There is no option for these folks. They should stay where they are. Even if it’s—it’s expensive. It’s the nicest prison you’ll ever want to be in, by the way. And the rights of these terrorists are way beyond what a lot of people get in a lot of different circumstances. They’re not being mistreated at all. But there is no other option.”","3417","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"If the economy improves, and Democrats continue to maintain an advantage on domestic issues, the Republican candidates will increasingly highlight foreign policy, an area of perceived vulnerability for Obama and Clinton. McCain, who lost to Obama in 2008, said, perhaps hopefully, “National security, foreign policy, and terrorism will play a greater role in the decision-making of the American people than at any time since 1980.” He insisted that although Bush’s record on foreign policy contributed to his own defeat, “it has gone from a significant negative” at the start of the Obama Administration “to what has become more and more of a positive.”","3418","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"In August, Bush travelled to Simi Valley, California, to give a speech on foreign policy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Bush called Reagan “a leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words,” someone “who took command of events, rebuilt America’s strength, and moved the world toward peace.” But when he shifted from Reagan’s Cold War successes to more recent events his speech sounded more like a tribute to the Administration of George W. Bush.","3419","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially,” he said. But he argued that, whatever mistakes were made, it was the surge of troops in 2007 that “turned events toward victory.” The surge “was a success—brilliant, heroic, and costly.” It was Obama who lost Iraq, not his brother. The “premature withdrawal was the fatal error,” Jeb said, referring to Obama’s gradual drawdown, “creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill—and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.”","3420","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He then turned this logic against the Democrats’ most likely nominee. “ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat,” he said. “And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the President himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.”","3421","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"Clinton herself has tried to create some distance from Obama’s record. Since leaving the Administration, she has repeatedly said that as Secretary of State she urged Obama to do more in the early days of the Syrian uprising against Assad, when moderates could still be found in that country and American intervention could, arguably, have made a difference. Obama has dismissed that view as “a fantasy.” But, whatever Clinton actually believes about the correct course in the Middle East, she has already shown that she will adopt the campaign position that best suits her politically. In early October, facing a challenge from the left from Bernie Sanders, she reversed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that she championed as Secretary of State.","3422","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"It’s easy to attack Obama as feckless in the face of the chaos in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Less apparent is how to translate vague campaign promises to do something into a plan that won’t put more American lives at risk. After Jeb Bush spoke with Wilson in South Carolina, he met with reporters backstage. His aides were scrambling to contain any fallout from the “stuff happens” remark, which had immediately elicited a response from President Obama, and echoed one of the most notorious statements of the Bush Administration: Rumsfeld’s declaration during the chaos in Iraq that “stuff happens.” After defending his remark, Jeb Bush then took some questions about Syria, Iraq, and Putin.","3423","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria that would help a Sunni-led army fight a two-front war against Assad and ISIS, but it’s unclear who would make up the forces. He told reporters that American airpower in Syria is “restricted by lawyers kind of imposing all sorts of conditions.” He would change the rules, he said, so “that it would be there to fight to win.” He didn’t specify which rules he would lift, but, as Graham noted, almost every military expert dismisses the idea that airpower alone can defeat ISIS. “The only way you destroy a big ground opponent is with another big ground opponent,” Graham told me. “You’re not going to bomb ISIL into submission. You gotta go tear the caliphate up by the roots. That means going into Syria on the ground.”","3424","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"To fight ISIS in Iraq, Bush made the familiar argument that America should arm the Kurds and “embed with the Iraqi military,” both of which Obama is effectively doing. When asked whether he would send more troops, Bush said that the U.S. already has thirty-five hundred troops in Iraq and that the real issue was how to better integrate them into Iraqi forces. Pressed further, he conceded, in a roundabout way, that he would be willing to send more American troops back to Iraq.","3425","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I would listen to the military commanders and I would create a strategy,” he said, a phrase that politicians revert to whenever they want to avoid details. “If it required more supportive troops, fine.” The statement was a reminder of Bush’s continuing dilemma: can he get the nomination without violating his principles? In the months since the start of his campaign, he has only clouded the matter of what, precisely, he stands for.","3426","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"At one point, someone asked Bush a churlish question about his father’s 1991 statement regarding the possibility of “a new world order” after the Cold War ended. Bush used it as an opportunity to talk about Obama’s alleged retreat from the world.","3427","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"
"“I don’t even know what that means anymore,” he said. “In 1992, it meant the end of Communism, and that the United States needed to play a constructive role in forging peace and security, and we still have that role to play. We have threats that are created by our absence. Just look at what’s going on in Syria as an example of that, where we have no strategy, where Putin, agile as he is, ends up injecting himself into something that makes it harder for me to imagine that this brutal Assad regime will depart.” He thought for a moment and added, “American leadership matters.” ♦","3428","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/what-would-jeb-do"

"Lately, she has been getting inquiries about the provenance of Donald Trump’s hair style. “The comb-over goes back to ancient Rome, at least,” she said. “Roman comb-overs were not based on the side part, as they are today. To part the hair was an exclusively feminine practice avoided by ‘manly’ Roman men. If a Roman man’s hair was thinning, but still present, he allowed the hair at the crown to grow longer and combed it forward. This type of comb-over is visible on portrait statues of Emperor Hadrian. If a man was hippocratically bald”—hairless on top, like Hippocrates—“he would grow any remaining side hair longer and comb each side up over the top to meet in the middle. These comb-overs were unstable, because of gravity and wind. They were likely held in place with pomade or primitive hair gels made from acacia gum—ancient versions of the hairspray, in other words, that keeps Donald Trump’s signature comb-over in place.","3467","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“I can talk about pretty much every candidate,” Stephens went on. “A few general points: Carly Fiorina, Jim Webb, Ted Cruz, and Trump all would have mocking epigrams written about their dye jobs. Jeb Bush would fit right into the first century A.D., the bridge between the Republic and the principate. Ben Carson looks more like a third-century soldier: he has great dignity, but he doesn’t really resemble any Roman emperors. Chris Christie could be Emperor Vespasian, but he’d have to lose a little more hair. He’d also have to brush forward and trim his bangs. He resembles Vespasian mostly in facial shape and attitude.","3468","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“Ted Cruz would fit perfectly in ancient Rome. Carly Fiorina, absolutely not: short hair was a sign you’d been conquered. Jim Gilmore vaguely resembles Emperor Galba, from the first century. I’m amazed at how many styles Bobby Jindal has had. He’d fit into the Trajanic period, early second century. Perfect throughout the Mediterranean world.”","3469","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"As for Lindsey Graham, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, George Pataki, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, and Rick Santorum, “they’d all be fine in ancient Rome if they combed forward. Rand Paul has a kind of disturbing resemblance to Patrick Stewart in ‘I, Claudius.’ That curly hair with a very slight leftward part: you could just drop him into the middle of ancient Rome and, except for eye color, he’d fit.","3470","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“Scott Walker resembles Emperor Tiberius. Lincoln Chafee bears an interesting similarity to Emperor Trajan, but he’d need a cleft chin. Hillary Clinton, because of her short hair and blue eyes, would be a captive like Fiorina. Bernie Sanders carries the spirit of Rome. He lets his hair grow out between cuts, perfect for ancient Roman portraiture: ‘uncared-for beauty,’ as Ovid would have said.","3471","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"“Donald Trump is the outlier. Definitely the Gallus comatus, or long-haired Gaul. His comb-over is just too much for ancient Rome.” She paused to look up a line of verse. “Martial wrote a funny poem about an acquaintance with a comb-over, Epigram 10.83. I’m partial to a translation that ends, ‘Why not be straightforward and admit to being an old man / so that at last you look like one man? / Nothing is uglier than a bald head with a lot of hair.’ ” ♦","3472","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/by-a-hair"
"In 1998, David Mamet, the acclaimed playwright, published a short treatise, “Three Uses of the Knife,” on “the nature and purpose of drama.” The book, based on lectures he delivered the previous year at Columbia University, is well regarded in the theatre world and among screenwriters for its philosophical approach to explaining what makes good drama. But Mamet’s book also offers some shrewd observations on politics and serves as a useful tool for understanding the rise, and potential fall, of Donald Trump.","September 18, 2015","3473","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"On Wednesday evening, during the Republican Presidential debate on CNN, Trump was exposed as ignorant of basic policy details (he was a bystander during the foreign-policy exchanges), boorish (he refused to apologize to Columba Bush for saying that her background influenced Jeb’s allegedly permissive views on undocumented immigrants), and he seemed—no other way to put it—“low energy” as the debate dragged on into its third hour. (As my colleague Amy Davidson put it, “he seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake.”) Political observers then spent the day after the debate ruminating on whether we may be witnessing the beginning of Trump’s decline, and whether his fate will look similar to that of the five Republican candidates—Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum—who all experienced similar polling surges in the 2012 G.O.P. Presidential contest, before Republican voters wised up and picked Mitt Romney.","3474","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Why did Trump’s support shoot up to an average of almost thirty-five per cent in national polls? The (boring) political-science answer is that Trump’s support was a function of his news coverage. His rise correlates perfectly with the amount of attention he received from the media. When voters, most of whom don’t pay close attention to politics, are asked to choose from a long list of names, a third mention the one that they’ve heard in the news most recently or most frequently.","3475","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"But that explanation seems to leave a lot out. Why does the media cover Trump so much? Are voters, especially “the likely voters” who are often polled, really that passive and ignorant? Why did they express increasingly positive views of him, as measured by favorability ratings, as the summer of Trump rolled on? How did Trump seize our attention?","3476","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"He did it by stepping onto the summer stage in a way that none of his rivals did. The other Republican candidates spent 2015 attending to the traditional business of the so-called invisible primary: hiring staff, studying up on policy, building political networks in Iowa and New Hampshire, wooing elected officials whose endorsements might make a difference, and—most of all—courting donors.","3477","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Most of the invisible primary is, well, invisible. Getting inside the rooms in New York and Miami and Dallas and Washington where the transactions of the invisible primary take place is nearly impossible. Sometimes good stories drip out, but they make for terrible TV. Meanwhile, much of the public portion of the invisible primary bores the media. Generally, the policy speeches and town-hall events in the early stages of the campaign are vague and uninteresting, as candidates resist taking firm and detailed positions on controversial topics for fear of opening themselves up to attacks later on.","3478","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"But the political press demands drama. If it is not given a plot, it will create one. As Mamet argues, this is hardly unique to reporters. Humans are hardwired to turn mundane experiences into dramatic ones. “It is in our nature to dramatize,” he writes. “We dramatize the weather, the traffic, and other impersonal phenomena by employing exaggeration, ironic juxtaposition, inversion, projection, all the tools the dramatist uses to create, and the psychoanalyst uses to interpret, emotionally significant phenomena.”","3479","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"A political campaign that is organized around a drama has an immediate advantage over one that is not. Mamet argues, and he’s right, that politics “sticks closer to traditional drama than does The Stage itself. A problem is stated, the play begins, the hero (candidate) offers herself as the protagonist who will find the solution, and the audience gives its attention.”","3480","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Which of the candidates has done that this year? Trump—and, to some extent, Bernie Sanders—has provided a plot and fared well. Trump has identified a clear problem to which many Republican voters respond: America doesn’t “win anymore.” And he has offered a simple solution that only he can provide: Trump “will make America great again.”","3481","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"The fact that the problem and solution are laughably vague is a virtue. Hillary Clinton’s campaign has been forgettable exactly because she has insisted on promoting a myriad of highly specific solutions to very concrete problems before she has laid out the one big problem she wants to solve. (In fact, it’s not so different from how Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign of “hope and change” crushed Clinton’s campaign of policy white papers.) Mamet argues that a politician “who promises drama and then delivers only social concern” rarely excites the public. That’s why it’s “essential to the healthy political campaign that the issues be largely or perhaps totally symbolic—i.e. non-quantifiable.” He recites a long list of slogans from recent American history, to which Trump’s could easily be added: “Peace with Honor, Communists in the State Department, Supply Side Economics, Recapture the Dream, Bring Back the Pride.” The less detail, he argues, the more engaged the audience will be: “A loose abstraction allows audience members to project their own desires onto an essentially featureless goal.”","3482","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Trump realized all of this, and he has had a great first act. But Wednesday night’s debate suggested that he has no plan for a second act. First acts are famously easy to pull off. “It has often been remarked that anyone can write a good first act,” Mamet notes. “When the curtain goes up, we’ve got your attention. So we dramatists don’t have to do anything for a while. Later, either the plot will kick in or the audience will start yawning and eating popcorn.”","3483","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"The struggle of the second act in a political campaign, as in any drama, is that the problem identified at the beginning—the one that seized our attention—must be translated into the more mundane tasks that propel the protagonist toward his or her goal. Won’t even the most committed Trump supporter start to wonder why this self-proclaimed savior hasn’t prepared himself to answer standard policy questions? Will Trump build a staff and campaign infrastructure in Iowa and New Hampshire to handle all the dull mechanics of finding voters and getting them to the polls? Again, Obama’s historic 2008 campaign is a good point of comparison: the vague promise of “hope and change” was married to an enormously sophisticated national operation that tended to the mechanics of winning the delegates needed to capture his party’s nomination.","3484","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Mamet illustrates second-act problems—and their solutions—by pointing to the real-life examples of political actors who actually changed history. The most ambitious and inspirational leaders are also the ones who, after articulating what seemed to be an impossibly lofty goal, soon found themselves mired in the tedious work required to realize it. “In the middle term the high-minded goal has devolved into what seem to be quotidian, mechanical, and ordinary drudgery,” Mamet writes. Trump seems more ill-prepared to bother with the ordinary drudgery of politics than anyone in the race.","3485","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Perhaps Trump can keep the first act going a little longer, but it is far more likely—and the debate made it seem obvious—that he hasn’t a clue how to move beyond the bluster and bromides that initially seized our attention. The curtain may come down soon.","3486","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act"
"Politico has posted a fifty-one-second compilation video of what it calls “unfortunate comments” by Jeb Bush—“stuff happens,” “free stuff,” “anchor babies,” “I’m not sure we need to spend half a billion dollars for women’s-health issues,” and so on. The implication is that it’s a mystery why a sixty-two-year-old third-generation politician, the grandson of a senator and the son and brother of Presidents (his own son George P. Bush, an office-holder in Texas, is fourth-generation), would be capable of making stupid mistakes in a campaign that he has to have been thinking about for decades.","October 7, 2015","3487","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"All of the unfortunate comments are presumably impolitic, but all of them also seem to reveal what Bush really thinks: mass shootings ought not give rise to gun-control legislation, government payments engender dependency, illegal immigrants have babies so that they can stay in the United States, women’s-health issues (especially birth control!) should not be government’s responsibility. Bush, as an insider, is supposed to know better than to be this candid, especially when he is confronted with the difficult task of persuading a very conservative Republican primary electorate to trust him, while in full view, via the press, of the much more liberal general electorate. Candor is for people like Donald Trump.","3488","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Jeb Bush seems to be, to descend into New Age lingo, a left-brain politician: rational to a fault. George W. Bush was right-brain: instinctive. Left-brain politicians think about policy. Right-brain politicians think about politics, and about how to connect with people. George W.’s description of himself, in the 2000 campaign, as a “compassionate conservative” was brilliantly vague—liberals heard it as “I’m not all that conservative,” and conservatives heard it as “I’m deeply religious.” It was about him as a person, not a program. Jeb’s slogan, “Right to rise,” is harder-edged, more specific in its implications, less personal, and easier to attack.","3489","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Jeb Bush has said that he is the most ideologically conservative member of his family, and he’s also known for being fascinated by the details of government. His brother preferred to have issues boiled down into very short memos. He prided himself on decisiveness, not knowledge or intellectual consistency.","3490","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"It may not be so easy for liberals in 2015 to understand why many conservatives regard George W. as a sellout. His sins, in conservatives’ view, included getting the federal government much more involved with local public schools through No Child Left Behind, creating a very expensive new entitlement program in the prescription-drug benefit for senior citizens, and going to war for reasons beyond an immediate need to protect the homeland.","3491","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Jeb, compared to his brother, seems much more sincerely devoted to the great theoretical cause of American conservatism, limited government. You can sense his impulse to turn each news event to which he must respond into a teachable moment about how government isn’t the solution to every problem. No less than liberals, conservatives feel themselves to be perpetual underdogs, because the other side’s main selling point, the provision of government benefits to people, is far more immediately appealing. Conservatives see themselves as having the challenge of arguing that you really shouldn’t want the goodies the Democrats are offering you. That’s the place where Bush’s unfortunate comment about taking care of you with free stuff seems to come from.","3492","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"For a very long time, Presidential politics have been stuck in a dynamic in which Republicans attack “government” without getting too specific about which of the government’s activities they have in mind, and Democrats defend popular programs but not the over-all idea of the welfare state. Bill Clinton’s typically centrist attempt to address the larger issue was to say, in his second inaugural address, that government was not the problem but neither was it the solution. Who can argue with that?","3493","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"Anyone who has found this situation frustrating ought to be happy with the way this campaign season is going. The legacy of the financial crisis and the rise of Bernie Sanders have pushed Hillary Clinton to be more open about offering government as a corrective to the excesses of the market than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama has generally been. And Jeb Bush is one of several Republican candidates—one of whom isn’t Trump—to make specific, non-consensus proposals.","3494","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments"
"It seems possible that, in a year, we might have two candidates who openly disagree, both about the proper role of government in theory and about many specific programs in practice.

"“President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America—it is nothing less than lunacy,” Ted Cruz said on Fox News, the day after the attacks on Paris. If there are Syrian Muslims who are really being persecuted, he said, they should be sent to “majority-Muslim countries.” Then he reset his eyebrows, which had been angled in a peak of concern, as if he had something pious to say. And he did: “On the other hand,” he added, “Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them. But President Obama refuses to do that.”","November 16, 2015","3496","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The next day, at a middle school in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Cruz spoke even more openly about those whom he considers to be the good people in the world. He told reporters that we should accept Christians from Syria, and only Christians, because, he said, “There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.” This will come as a profound surprise to the people of Oklahoma City and Charleston, to all parties in Ireland, and to the families of the teen-agers whom Anders Breivik killed in Norway, among many others. The Washington Post noted that Cruz “did not say how he would determine that refugees were Christian or Muslim.” Would he accept baptismal certificates, or notes from pastors? Does he just want to hear the refugees pray?","3497","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"On Monday, President Barack Obama reacted to this suggestion with some anger. “When I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims, when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who’s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefitted from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that’s shameful,” Obama said. (That last bit, about “families who’ve benefitted” when fleeing persecution, was an unmistakable reference to Cruz and Marco Rubio.) Obama continued, “That’s not who we are. We don’t have religious tests to our compassion.” The question is whether Obama can put that compassion to use, in this precipitous moment after Paris, when so many bad choices will seem appealing, including attacks on our fellow-citizens. (On Monday, Donald Trump said that, though he’d “hate to do it,” as President he would “seriously consider” closing mosques that were viewed as centers of radicalism.) The real criticism is that the United States has taken so few Syrian refugees of any religion—just about fifteen hundred, all of whom have been screened by a process that can take up to two years.","3498","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Cruz is cruder than some, but he is not alone among Republicans. On Sunday, Jeb Bush also said that, although he isn’t entirely opposed to helping refugees who’d been screened, “I think our focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore.” (Christians were ten per cent of Syria’s population when the civil war broke out.) On Monday morning, Bush spoke about how “we should focus on creating safe havens for refugees in Syria rather than bringing them all the way across the United States”—a life in no-fly zones, while, according to a vision Bush also laid out over the weekend, a major land war involving U.S. troops was launched around them. He quickly added, “But I do think there is a special, important need to make sure that Syrians are being protected, because they are being slaughtered in the country and, but for us, who—who would take care of the number of Christians that right now are completely displaced?” Others, like Rubio, have avoided the Christian question by saying that they don’t think we should take refugees at all. Ben Carson, speaking to Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday,” said that taking in refugees “from that area of the world, I think, is a huge mistake. … To bring them over here, under these circumstances, is a suspension of intellect,” and would ignore “the reason the human brain has these big frontal lobes, as opposed to other animals.” (He then talked at greater length about “brain stems.”) Trump, in the past, has claimed that Syrian Muslim refugees can get into America “easily” (they cannot), while “if you’re from Syria and you’re Christian you cannot come into this country” (again, not the case). But, mostly, Trump doesn’t want to let anybody in, at least not anybody of the tempest-tossed type. Indeed, it’s not clear that the talk of Christian refugees is meant, even by the loudest Republicans, to translate into the appearance of Syrian Christians in America, as opposed to being an acknowledgment that some of the crowds that cheer when they hear anti-immigrant rhetoric might have qualms of conscience. The problem, they can be told, is just that our Muslim-sympathizing, cowardly leaders would bring in the wrong refugees.","3499","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"Christians are in danger in Syria. Their danger is distinct but not unique. The Yazidis, an even more isolated religious minority, have been a particular target of ISIS. Shiites and Alawites have been targeted, too. Refugee policies have at times rightly recognized the urgent danger that certain religious or otherwise distinct groups are in, and have properly responded. This is something quite different than saying, as Cruz does, that being a Muslim should be a basis for exclusion. Would he let in atheists, for that matter? It seems strange, when moderate Muslims are trying to distance themselves from a milieu of terror, that we would insist that such a thing is impossible. There are international and American laws that recognize people who need protection. There are principles of common decency which do the same. What they do not do is use faith, or the lack of it, as a basis for rejection. (America should have let in more Jewish refugees during the Second World War; that wouldn’t have meant turning away Thomas Mann.) And it is a brutal insult to Syrians who have gone through four and half years of carnage to say that the fact that they are Sunnis gives them some sort of immunity from ISIS or from the Assad regime. There are four million Syrian refugees outside of the country now, and many more inside it. There will likely be some bad people among them. That fact does not obviate their suffering. Taking more of them in can be an unpopular position at a moment when the news is full of speculation that one of the Paris attackers had passed through a refugee camp in Greece with a Syrian passport. But their desperation will not disappear if we lose interest in it; it may just take a different and more destructive form. We have a role in deciding where they will go next.","3500","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"One of the more dishonest aspects of Cruz’s comments on Fox was his characterization of who the Syrian refugees are. He mentioned an estimate that, in the “early waves” of refugees entering Europe, “seventy-seven per cent of those refugees were young men. That is a very odd demographic for a refugee wave.” Perhaps it would be, if the number were accurate. A bare majority of the Syrian refugees are women, as FactCheck.org noted in September, when Ben Carson and Scott Walker raised similar alarms. About twenty-two per cent are men between the ages of eighteen and fifty-nine—a broad definition of “young.” Cruz is smart enough to know this. He may be referring to a number given for migrants who arrived in Europe, from nine different countries, by taking a specific, dangerous Mediterranean sea route in 2014 (seventy-two per cent). Among the two million Syrian refugees the United Nations has registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon, a full thirty-eight per cent are under the age of twelve.","3501","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"For that matter, why shouldn’t there be young men among the refugees? In stories about why people emigrate, like the one told by Nicholas Schmidle last month in The New Yorker, one reason young men give as a motivating factor for leaving their countries is the fear of being conscripted by one side or the other. They don’t want to be killed, and they don’t want to be killers. Is it Cruz’s view that a nineteen-year-old, just out of high school, should head for the hills, looking for the moderate Syrian opposition that even the C.I.A. has been unable to find? Or should he languish in a camp, with no prospects of really settling anywhere, as a target for the wrong type of tutor? That is not going to make Europe or the United States any safer. What Cruz and the others are saying is that the threat people are living under, which has been enough to drive them from their homes, should not matter. What does matter is whether we feel threatened by them.","3502","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"
"The other insinuation that Cruz and others are making is that Obama doesn’t like Christians, and refuses to acknowledge the Islamic character of terrorism—maybe, they suggest, because of his character, or because of who he is. “I recognize that Barack Obama does not wish to defend this country,” Cruz said. And saying that was shameful, too.","3503","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/ted-cruzs-religious-test-for-syrian-refugees"

Two nights earlier, the guest, Jeb Bush, had put in a serviceable performance: hands clasped, a look on his face that was only slightly terrified.

Colbert asked Biden how he kept a “soul” in Washington, and Biden replied with an old line about Amtrak—“I commuted every day for thirty-six years”—before turning serious. He admitted that the culture of falsity in D.C. baffled him. He wondered “why in the world would you want the job if you couldn’t say what you believe.” Colbert offered condolences, and asked him for a story about Beau. “I never once—my word as a Biden—never ever heard my child complain.” He recalled a conversation shortly before Beau died, when Beau said, “Dad, I know how much you love me.

(Earlier that day, Bobby Jindal, a low-polling governor of Louisiana, had said, “It’s clear Donald Trump has never read the Bible.”) Of his own faith, Biden said, “I go to Mass, and I’m able to be just alone. Even in a crowd, you’re alone.” These days, he said, his wife, Jill, sometimes sticks notes on his bathroom mirror to read while he shaves; not long ago, she put up a quote from Kierkegaard: “Faith sees best in the dark.” He said, “The faith doesn’t always stay with you.”","3508","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"

When Colbert was ten, his father and two brothers were killed in a plane crash. Biden went on, “Losing your dad when you’re a kid . . . It’s like asking what made your mother do it every day?

"Eventually, Colbert got around to asking about the campaign, recalling that Biden had said recently that he wasn’t sure if he is “emotionally prepared” to run for President. Biden looked up at the klieg lights and gave a jut of the chin. “Look, I don’t think any man or woman should run for President unless, No. 1, they know exactly why they would want to be President. And, No. 2, they can look at folks out there and say, ‘I promise you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this.’ And, and, I’d be lying if I said that I knew I was there. I’m being completely honest. But nobody has a right in my view to seek that office unless they are willing to give it a hundred and ten per cent of who they are.”","3516","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"Biden circled back to Beau. The Vice-President said that he was recently meeting troops and their families, in Denver. “It was going great,” Biden said. “And then a guy in the back yells, ‘Major Beau Biden! Bronze star, sir! Served with him in Iraq.’ And all of a sudden, I lost it.” Biden smiled—a grateful but haunted smile. “How can you—That’s not—I shouldn’t be saying this.” He trailed off.","3517","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"The eighteen minutes that Joe Biden spoke with Stephen Colbert produced the most public and painful demonstration of emotional honesty by any politician in months, if not years. Biden could never speak in a campaign quite the way that he spoke on Colbert. But a version of that would be powerful, and it was impossible not to see, in the Biden interview, a rebuttal to Trump’s moment in America—to the notion of self-promotion as success, of cruelty as candor, of empathy as weakness. Biden is no naïf; after a half-century in politics, he knew that he was doing well on that stage, and one suspects that he also knows the delicate risks inherent in seeking to convert deep good will into political capital.","3518","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"The familiar reasons why Biden would be a long-shot candidate remain what they were a week ago. Most importantly, a candidate is never more popular than on the day before he announces. But, already, the 2016 campaign has upturned expectations about what the political class thought Americans want most. Hillary Clinton is confronting more than a strategic deficit. (A Times headline this week: “Hillary Clinton to Show More Humor and Heart, Aides Say.”) If Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump can excite voters by simply suggesting the presence of candor, real or imagined, what would be the reaction to a candidate who doesn’t need to strain to say what he believes?","3519","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/biden-alone-in-a-crowd"
"“I don’t mean to be disrespectful,” Donald Trump said, about a dozen insults into his speech in Dallas, at the American Airlines Center, on Monday night. “But when a man has a problem, and he’s got his wife or his girlfriend, and they move her over the border for one day, has the baby on the other side of the border—our side—now that baby is a citizen of our country for however long the baby lives.” Perhaps sensing that the last phrase might sound a bit ominous, he quickly added, “hopefully, a long time,” then continued his immigration-as-paternity-suit-fraud riff: “It’s wrong. It’s wrong. And by the way, by the way, the law doesn’t call that. That’s not what the law says. And people are finding out now that I’m right. We didn’t say that someone could be pregnant for nine months, come across the border, have the baby, and now it’s ours and we have to take care of that baby forever. It doesn’t say that. It does not say that.”","September 15, 2015","3520","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"The law that Trump was referring to was, presumably, the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which is, indeed, not worded in terms of a man having “a problem.” It is phrased like this: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Maybe your parents have just arrived on what is, when you take your first breath, your side of the border. Maybe your ancestors have been here for four hundred years—and, perhaps, for two hundred and fifty of them, until the adoption of that amendment, in 1868, they were, as the Supreme Court affirmed in the notorious Dred Scott decision, deprived of full citizenship themselves because they were held as slaves. (The Fourteenth Amendment voided Dred Scott. It is telling that Mike Huckabee, who has been spuriously attacking the Court’s marriage-equality decision by comparing it to Dred Scott, has also said that he wants the Citizenship Clause abrogated.) In either case, you have what has come to be referred to as “birthright citizenship.” But birthright citizenship has become a contentious issue in the Republican primary race, with outright calls that it should be done away with or disavowed (Trump, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham); that it “doesn’t make any sense” (Ben Carson); that it needs to be “reëxamined” (Chris Christie); or that it is being “taken advantage” of in ways that should be countered (Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush)—or just a waffling unwillingness to defend it (Scott Walker). If there is a single question that the candidates should be confronted about in the debate on Wednesday night, it is the nature of their commitment to birthright citizenship, because there are few issues that reveal more about their ideas of America, and about their willingness to play on the country’s fears and divisions.","3521","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"In the debate, there is likely to be mention of “anchor babies,” a term that serves to hook certain Republican audiences with its insinuations. In his speech in Dallas, Trump moved directly from immigrant criminals—“It’s disgusting what’s happening to our country. We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world”—to “the whole subject of anchor babies,” as if they were mini vectors of destruction. In fact, an American child cannot help his or her parents gain residency until he or she is twenty-one. The suspicion of alien identity attached to the phrase has already moved beyond the realm of rhetoric to affect the lives of American children: some babies born in Texas have had a hard time getting birth certificates, because their parents don’t have proper identification. But what is an “anchor baby”? Insofar as a slur can have a technical definition, it refers to a child born in the United States to parents who are undocumented, whether those parents have been here for years or for a day, and regardless of how long they hope to stay. This definition, at any rate, has been the basis for claims that two, three, or four hundred thousand such babies are born in this country each year. (The Wall Street Journal did a survey of various studies.) But those numbers have, in the Republican campaign, been joined with definitions that are anecdotal and demagogic—like Trump’s talk of a woman practically in labor stumbling over the border for twenty-four hours to give birth, or accounts of “maternity tourism.” Jeb Bush, acting puzzled that anyone thought his use of the term “anchor babies” was an insult to Latinos, said, “Frankly, it’s more related to Asian people—coming into our country, having children in that organized effort, taking advantage of a noble concept, which is birthright citizenship.” Those babies, he said, were involved in a “fraud.”","3522","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"As it happens, fear-mongering about Asian immigrants was part of an early effort, in the eighteen-nineties, to compromise the Fourteenth Amendment. Chinese workers had come to build the railroads and a good part of the state of California; the Chinese Exclusion Act denied them citizenship, but some of them had children here. One of those children was Wong Kim Ark, who was born at 751 Sacramento Street, in San Francisco, in an apartment above his father’s store. Twice, as a young adult, he took trips to China. The first time, in 1890, he was readmitted as a matter of course—he was American. The second time, in 1895, he was denied entry. As Fred Barbash recently recounted in the Washington Post, opponents of Chinese immigration had been looking for a test case that could be used to get courts to do something that, partly because it went against the plain meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, they hadn’t done before: to read the phrase about being born in and “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States as excluding people with foreign parents. Why it would do so is a little baffling: San Francisco was certainly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Wong’s parents, as they went about their business in California, were certainly not exempt from its laws. (The jurisdiction phrase is generally understood to deal with special areas within the United States, such as Native American reservations and embassies.) Part of the argument that the U.S. Attorney trying to deport Wong made was that Wong’s parents were, nonetheless, “subjects” of someone else, namely the Emperor of China—which might be a valid reading of a sentence including a different meaning of the word “subject,” but not the one in the citizenship clause. That the amendment’s language was, in truth, not the heart of the matter was made clear when the U.S. Attorney added, “The said Wong Kim Ark has been at all times, by reason of his race, language, color and dress, a Chinese person.”","3523","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"Wong Kim Ark’s case went to the Supreme Court, and he won. The decision cited the “clear words and manifest intent” of the Fourteenth Amendment. The principle in the decision has since been affirmed and codified. But the idea that there is a qualification to the Citizenship Clause, one that is being ignored by forces willing to see America overrun by foreigners, has gained a sort of murmuring traction. It is what Trump is referring to when he says, “people are finding out now that I’m right.” Last month, Sean Hannity, of Fox News, introduced Mark Levin, the author of “Plunder and Deceit,” a book that argues that the Fourteenth Amendment is being misread, by saying, “Rand Paul was right on this. Trump was right on this. Cruz is right on this. Walker is right on this,” and asking, “Why are so many people getting this wrong?” Levin explained that it was thanks to “some phony constitutional lawyers” focussed on the “results” of greater immigration. He added that anyone who thought otherwise didn’t know “the history.” “Agree completely,” Hannity said. It is as though “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” was just a bar of white noise, which could be filled in with anything—dual citizenship, the illegal crossing of a border, a strange language, religion, or clothing—to ignore the claim of an American child.","3524","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"Ted Cruz says that birthright citizenship should “absolutely” be limited, but he believes that the constitutional arguments on both sides are made in “good faith.” He said on “Face the Nation” that Congress could start by passing “a law defining what the words in the Fourteenth Amendment ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ means,” but that amending the Fourteenth Amendment would be more effective. It might just take a lot of time.","3525","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"One might better ask what vision of America it would require. Trump, in his speech in Dallas, said that he had been told that “anchor babies” was “not a nice term,” but said that it was one “we have to use.” (Hillary Clinton has suggested another option: “babies.”) Trump’s embrace of the phrase points to another use of “anchor baby,” one that seems to tempt candidates like Jeb Bush: as something that cool conservatives can say to show that they are not subject to the jurisdiction of “political correctness”—that they are brave enough to insult babies. But protestations on that count should not, in the debate on Wednesday, substitute for an engagement with the real ugliness of what is being proposed by the frontrunners in the Republican race. Are any of them willing to say that they value, rather than fear, birthright citizenship? Do they envision people with certain names or skin colors being asked not only for their own papers but for those of their parents and grandparents? A better question might be this: since when has the idea that an immigrant hopes that her child will be born in America, because she believes in America, been something to scorn? Aspirations like that have always been the country’s foundation—and, one might say, its true anchors.","3526","http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate"
"One day in the fall of 1997, Gloria Steinem was unpacking a carry-on bag that in the course of a few weeks had seen the inside of more airplane overhead bins than most travellers’ do in a year, and, as she tells the story, that was when she knew it was time to write a book about her life on the road, rallying women to the fight for equal rights. Steinem was sixty-three then. She had been travelling for more than thirty years, speaking, advising, fund-raising, organizing, testifying, demonstrating, educating, campaigning, and, in the process, introducing millions of girls and women to the feminist cause—and during that time she had also founded and presided over the magazine Ms., written books, published and edited collections, and, through the Ms. Foundation, which she and three friends of the magazine established, nurtured the talent of generations of younger feminists. But she had never stopped travelling, and she wasn’t about to now, with a road book planned. “I’ve spent more time on the road than not,” she told me this past summer. “It’s been the most important part of my life—and a big antidote to the idea that there is ‘one’ American people.”","3527","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem finished the book in February this year, or, as she puts it, “seventeen deadlines late,” and in March she celebrated her eighty-first birthday, with a small dinner cooked by a group of friends. “A relief!” she told me. “My eightieth birthday had gone on for a year. People were starting to think that the movement began with me and, worse, was going to end with me.” It wasn’t the first time this had happened. Steinem’s decennials, marked by her enduringly beautiful face, have been a source of fascination (and huge spikes in feminist fund-raising) since she turned forty and a clueless reporter remarked, by way of a compliment, “Oh, you don’t look forty”—to which she replied, “This is what forty looks like. We’ve been lying for so long, who would know?” Every ten years since then, that face, with its iconic curtain of long, straight hair falling from a center part, begins to appear on magazine covers, television screens, dorm posters, and even T-shirts: this is what fifty looks like, what sixty looks like, this is seventy. Her eightieth-birthday marathon kicked off with a benefit in Philadelphia, and, while she spent her actual birthday on an elephant in Botswana, she spent the rest of the year “using myself” to promote the cause and the work of other feminists—and to finally finish her book. “I was out of excuses,” she told me. “Embarrassing!”","3528","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Toward the end of May, Steinem, her galleys corrected and delivered, boarded a plane to Beijing, where thirty-one peace activists—among them two Nobel laureates—from thirteen countries were gathering to fly to North Korea on a peace mission. Their intention, as Steinem explained it, was to cross the DMZ into South Korea, “standing in” for the Korean women on both sides of a longitudinal line they had been forbidden to cross since the war there ended, in 1953. “We were hoping to walk the entire DMZ, because we were all in white, wearing peace scarves,” she said. “But they put us on a bus instead. While we were still in Beijing, a friend called and asked what I was doing. I said, ‘I’m being a parody of myself.’ True. But I learned an enormous amount—most of all, that those years of isolation and hostility didn’t work. North Korea is the most controlling place I’ve ever been. The day we crossed the DMZ was the longest day of my life. In every way.”","3529","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Twelve days later, Steinem was in Vermont, giving the commencement address at Bennington College, and on her way home she e-mailed to say that she was ready for conversation. “I’ve got a slow few weeks—plenty of time to talk,” she said when I joined her that afternoon, in the garden of the Upper East Side brownstone where she has lived since the late sixties, when she was a rent-controlled tenant, and now owns the first two floors. “Well, slow for me,” she added, given that in a few days she would be flying to Alaska to speak to an audience of three thousand at the University of Alaska’s Fairbanks campus.","3530","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"She had leaped at the invitation. Alaska was the one state she had never visited, and college campuses, she said, had always been “the single largest slice of my travelling pie”—laboratories of social activism and, in the end, social change. Typically, her schedule was packed. Among other things, she would be paying a visit to the city’s “victim-services shelter,” the Interior Alaska Center for Non-Violent Living, where more than half the residents were Native Alaskan women from isolated settlements, many with their children. She would also be lunching with ten well-heeled white women, who had bid to join her for an “intimate” Fabulous Feminist Fundraiser. And she would be arguing the case for choice at a big Fairbanks co-operative that was under attack from a conservative borough assemblyman for condoning murder by stocking an issue of Ms. with an article about abortion.","3531","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"“The best part was the shelter, listening to those amazing women,” Steinem told me when she got home. “For them—women in trouble, in need, terrified, beaten, suicidal women, women with kids at risk—the question is where do you go when you’ve got no way to go, no roads, no cars, no way out. The violence rate in Alaska is high, and at first the shelter was secret. Now there’s always a state trooper on guard.”","3532","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"I asked Steinem what she thought she could do for those women, and she said, “I’m a media worker, in the parlance of the nineteen-thirties. It’s what I do. I’m an entrepreneur of social change. I raise money. I talk. I write. I tell stories. I want to do justice to the women I meet, to tell their stories. There was one young woman who asked me, ‘How do you stand up for yourself when you have no right to stand up for yourself?’ No one had ever told her that she had that right. The first time she tried, her husband had said no, she had no rights. I want to reach women like her.”","3533","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem is not a theorist, or even much interested in theory. “Feminist theory came from feminist activism—it wasn’t the other way around,” she said. “I accept that important theorists like Judith Butler may arrive at enlightening conclusions, but theory can be exclusionary, and that’s not my path. My path is to open the door to this house, to get out of the world I know, and to experience new worlds, new voices. It’s making connections, and using myself to listen, because you can’t empower women without listening to their stories. It’s why I was going to call my book ‘America—As If Everyone Matters.’ I liked that title—the irony in it—but I changed my mind after three black women founded the group Black Lives Matter. I didn’t want to detract from that powerful name or to suggest in any way that my ‘irony’ was a comment on it. Somebody at the publisher’s suggested ‘Memoir.’ I thought, That’s such an élite word. Wrong! Finally, we settled on ‘My Life on the Road.’ ” (Steinem, who doesn’t drive, says, “Well, not quite ‘on,’ more like ‘above.’ ”) It comes out this month.","3534","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"

"Steinem has a mantra that she says she lives by. She calls it “Ask the Turtle,” because it involves a turtle she rescued—or thought she had—on a geology-class field trip to the Connecticut River Valley in the spring of her freshman year at Smith. “I found a mud turtle on the riverbank, up by the asphalt road,” she told me. “A big snapping turtle, more than a foot long, but I picked it up—carefully—and lugged it down to the river and slipped it in. The professor saw me just as the turtle disappeared in the water. He said that the turtle had been making its way to dry land for a reason—in order to lay its eggs—and that now it was going to take that turtle months more to lay them. It was a lesson I learned to apply to people a few years later, in India—though I didn’t realize it then—when I was going from village to village with Gandhian women organizers, listening to them ask, ‘Tell us your stories. You’ve lived them, you’re the experts.’ ”","3536","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem comes from Toledo, Ohio, which, as she said one night, standing in her kitchen scrutinizing take-out menus, explains why she won’t eat sushi or rare meat, “like New Yorkers do.” She doesn’t blame Toledo, although her loyalty was seriously tested when the city presented her with a “Son of Ohio” plaque. But the road itself was something her father, Leo Steinem, taught her. Leo was the black-sheep son of a German-Jewish Toledo family—his father was a businessman and his mother a prominent local suffragist, the first woman to be elected to the Toledo Board of Education—which is to say that he was not enchanted by his parents’ comfortably progressive bourgeois Toledo life.","3537","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"“He was the real gypsy, not me,” Steinem said. “He was kind, loving, funny, but never in one place for long, which meant that we weren’t, either.” The longest times were summers in southern Michigan, where he had bought farmland. He built a small resort on it, with a lakeside dance pavilion, and booked the bands that were playing the summer circuit. But as soon as the season ended he would pack his wife, Ruth, and their two girls (Steinem’s sister was nine years older) into a trailer. For the rest of the year, the family moved slowly south, with Leo stopping in every town they passed, buying and selling and trading antiques, a peripatetic dealer. Steinem’s first full year of school anywhere was “maybe the seventh grade,” but by then she was reading a book a day—“Librarians saved my life,” she says—and had witnessed her parents’ mournful separation.","3538","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"It had been years in coming. When Steinem was born, her mother—the daughter of working-class Protestant parents and, when she met Leo, a successful young journalist—had already suffered one severe breakdown and spent nearly two years in a sanitarium. By the time they divorced, Ruth was addicted to sodium pentothal—“the same drug they fed to Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath,” Steinem says—and Leo was living out of a car in California, visiting once a year.","3539","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem, who lived alone with her mother from the age of ten until she left for college, says that, as a girl, she used to think that her mother was crazy. “It was only much later, when I began to understand how unjust the position of women was in this country, that I knew my mother had never been ‘ill,’ as the doctors claimed. It was that her spirit had been broken. Until then, I had always worried that I might have inherited something—that I’d start disappearing into the street in my nightgown, the way she had.”","3540","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"It isn’t surprising that Steinem had what she calls “a Hollywood vision of school.” She dreamed of becoming a dancer and maybe, eventually, a Rockette. “I imagined myself, with some impracticality, as dancing my way out of Toledo,” she told me. By the time she started high school, she had mastered tap dancing while twirling a baton, as well as dancing down a flight of stairs, like a Busby Berkeley showgirl, playing “Anchors Aweigh” on ankle bells. And though she balked at “sinking so low as to put taps on toe shoes”—in late-forties Toledo, the ultimate female talent test—dancing remains on her list of life’s fulfilling pleasures (along with organizing and great sex). She has been spotted dancing in elevators and office corridors, and even, for a few months in the nineteen-nineties, at the old Roseland Ballroom, taking tango lessons. “It’s a sick, authoritarian dance, but I loved it,” she says.","3541","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"I once asked Steinem what the real-estate developer and publisher Mort Zuckerman—a man I had seen, years earlier, signalling her to light his cigar—was doing on her otherwise egalitarian list of former lovers, which includes, most enduringly, Franklin Thomas, who for seventeen years was the head of the Ford Foundation (“the longtime love of my life, and best friend”), along with the great alto saxophonist and composer of “Take Five,” Paul Desmond (“a close friend and a short romance”), the director Mike Nichols (“more like three or four years of a smart date”), the Ford Administration’s Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Stan Pottinger (“We’d been together long enough, so we stopped the affair”), and the Olympic decathlete and actor Rafer Johnson, who helped tackle Sirhan Sirhan, moments after he shot Bobby Kennedy (“I have lasting respect for him”).

"“My father gave new meaning to the term ‘financially irresponsible,’ and after years of it my mom crashed,” Steinem told the actress and director Christine Lahti one night this summer. Lahti was debating putting together a theatre piece based on stories about the women in her own family, and the two friends went out to dinner and traded reminiscences about “the unlived lives of our moms.” Once, when Steinem was visiting, her mother told her, “Your sister just got a fur coat and didn’t have to pay for it”—meaning that her sister was married and Steinem, who was not, had to buy her own coats. “My mother wasn’t criticizing me—she was advising me,” Steinem told Lahti, laughing.","3543","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The women talked for a long time about the kind of liberation that comes from laughing—Steinem having watched six female comics perform at the Gotham Comedy Club the night before. The show was called Sisters of Comedy, and the impresario was the young feminist producer and writer Agunda Okeyo, who, at the time, was staying in Steinem’s guest room. “The power of laughter—that’s power!” she said. “It’s our only free emotion, the one that nobody can control.”","3544","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"“One of the hard things for me, starting out as an actress, was to laugh,” Lahti said. “To find a visual memory or image that let me laugh.” Today, it might be the look on her father’s face—he was a surgeon, partial to the ubiquitous male adage of his generation “Why buy the whole cow if you can get the milk free?”—if, as a teen-age girl, she had come back with the feminist retort “Why buy the whole pig just to get one little sausage?”","3545","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Lahti married in her thirties and has three children. Steinem married for the first time in her mid-sixties, inherited three stepchildren (among them the actor Christian Bale), and was widowed three years later, when her husband, David Bale, died of brain cancer, at the age of sixty-two. Bale was a South African-born British businessman and environmentalist. They met when he walked up to her at a Los Angeles Voters for Choice benefit. It was a happy marriage, “a green-card marriage, because we would have been together anyway,” Steinem told me. She says that caring for him that last year, when he was ill and “needed someone to help him out of life, and I needed someone to force me to live in the present,” had actually helped her “expiate the pain of my old terrors”—the terrors of caring for her mother when she was too young to understand or cope.","3546","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem has compared marriage to slavery law in this country. As a young woman, she fled one brief, ill-advised engagement. And, in her early forties, she amiably dissolved a second, to Robert Benton, who went on to write and direct “Kramer vs. Kramer.” “Neither of us was really sure we wanted to marry, so we took it in steps. The first was to do the blood tests and get the license. We did. The second was for him to buy the new suit. He did. The third was for me to buy the dress. I never got to the dress, I just couldn’t do it, and the marriage license expired.”","3547","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Four years after David Bale died, a reporter from Pakistan asked Steinem why she had changed her mind about marriage. “I didn’t change,” she told him. “Marriage changed. We spent thirty years in the United States changing the marriage laws. If I had married when I was supposed to get married, I would have lost my name, my legal residence, my credit rating, many of my civil rights. That’s not true anymore. It’s possible to make an equal marriage.”","3548","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem’s archives are at Smith. She is devoted to the college, which was founded, in the eighteen-seventies, with an endowment from Sophia Smith, a Massachusetts woman with a family fortune at her disposal and a strong desire to provide young women with what she described in her will as the “means and facilities” for higher education equal to any available to young men. In Steinem’s senior year, Chester Bowles, who would shortly be named Ambassador to India, came to speak. He was so taken by the students’ response that he donated his lecture fee of two thousand dollars—serious money, in those days, when a year’s room, board, and tuition at Smith cost about half that—to help finance a year in India for two seniors after graduation. Steinem got one of the fellowships.","3549","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"“The first organizing I did was in India, though I didn’t realize it then, only that I wanted to stay,” she told me. She stayed two years, having talked the press office at Pan Am into free tickets with the promise of “writing something that would make people want to fly to India. I had figured out how to do that. My writing was what I’d depended on to get through exams. I’d make up a great quote and attribute it to an important thinker. The professor would be impressed.”","3550","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem’s oldest friend from India, the feminist organizer and economist Devaki Jain, flew to New York this summer to spend a couple of weeks in Steinem’s guest room, going over the manuscript of an autobiography that Steinem had been urging her to write. They had met in Delhi at the beginning of 1957, when Jain, just home on a break from Oxford, was doing research for a Gandhian co-operative union. “We became friends so fast, and with such ease, and we had a wonderful time,” Jain told me. “But Gloria was already inspired. Like Gandhi, she walked the road. She had the humility to do that. It was what she wanted.”","3551","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Jain, who was one of the first women in India to use the word “feminist,” lost touch with Steinem after she went home. In 1974, they reconnected in New York, and a few years later Jain arranged for Steinem to return to India. It was on that trip, Steinem told me—“and only after the great conflagration of feminist consciousness in America”—that she understood how much those first two years had shaped her.","3552","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"For one thing, she had quickly learned to eschew the car-with-driver distance preserved by many Westerners in India then, and, instead, to embrace the “dormitory on wheels” of rickety buses and the third-class women-only carriages of local trains—“leaving behind all my possessions except a cup, a comb, and the sari I had on” and discovering groups of women of all ages, sharing food and stories with other women they had just met. She had trekked to villages cordoned off by the government because of caste riots, and watched, at night, as the villagers emerged from mud huts to sit in circles, lit by kerosene lamps, and tell their stories of burnings, murders, thefts, and rapes, “with fear and trauma that needed no translation” but with the relief that came from talking and being heard. In her road book, she calls it “the first time I witnessed the ancient and modern magic of talking circles, those groups in which anyone may speak in turn, everyone must listen, and consensus is more important than time.”","3553","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"When Steinem returned from India, she started making the rounds of magazines and newspapers in New York, looking for a reporting job. It was not an experience that she would recommend. In those days, the news side of the business was a men’s club, and its prerogatives were rarely challenged. “We need a reporter, not a pretty girl” is how she remembers being shown the door by an editor at Life. She made her way freelancing. Her work from those days was direct, accessible, and often very funny, and in 1963 an editor at the magazine Show turned her loose on the Playboy Club. She went undercover as “Marie Catherine Ochs”—her grandmother’s name—applied to become a Playboy Bunny, got the job, and began her investigation into a world of puerile male fantasy, keeping a journal in which she recorded in deadpan detail her eleven days of Bunny life, from the physical exam and the pushup, waist-crunching costume to the sleazy, oblivious men who would tweak her cottontail whenever she passed their table with a tray of drinks. The piece she produced made her famous.","3554","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"“The rest of the Playboy story has two parts,” she told me. “First came the ‘looks’ attacks. I was accused of being noticed because of my ‘beauty.’ Well, let me tell you something from the bottom of my soul. When I was young, in high school, in college, I was considered a pretty girl. But beautiful? I wasn’t considered beautiful until the women’s movement.” She laughed and said, “The threshold was lower then!” The second part was that most of the attacks came from men—furious that an undercover Bunny had invaded a male playground, and that people were reading what she wrote and, worse, laughing at them. (“Men fear ridicule the way women fear violence,” she says.) If those men thought of feminism at all, it was as a historic blip that began and ended with the “suffragettes”—who in fact campaigned and crusaded for eighty-some years before American women won voting rights, in 1920.","3555","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The struggle for women’s suffrage is known today in the movement as “first wave” feminism, though it’s unlikely that the kind of man who, nearly fifty years ago, paid for the privilege of tweaking cottontails at a Playboy Club had ever heard the term, let alone knew that a second wave was on the way. Not even Steinem knew that at the time. What she knew was that there was something wrong in those waning days of America’s postwar suburban idyll, in which happily entitled men rushed home from work on their commuter trains to wives who greeted them at the door, holding out a perfectly calibrated Martini. In those days, feminism was best known as the refuge and revenge of ugly women—women who couldn’t find a man to marry them.","3556","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"I asked Steinem how she had dealt with the attacks, and she allowed that, at first, it wasn’t easy. “Other women in the movement helped me enormously, but there was one old woman in particular. I was giving a talk and the ‘looks’ thing came up. Before I could answer, she stood up and said, ‘It’s important for someone who could play the game, and win, to say, The game isn’t worth shit!’ I was so grateful to her for understanding that I could use who I was to say who we were and what we represent.”","3557","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"By then, of course, the feminist movement was undeniably resurgent. The National Organization for Women dates from 1966. La Raza Unida, one of the first political parties with a feminist agenda, was founded by Mexican-Americans in 1970. Black women’s groups had long been active, particularly in the South, fighting the double discrimination of race and gender; women artists’ and women writers’ collectives were springing up in California, demanding a place in museums and on publishers’ lists; and, in the big cities of the East, students and young working women were meeting in dorms and walkups for consciousness-raising sessions, talking about their lives and trying to figure out how to change them. Steinem was savvy enough to understand that the thorny gift of brains and beauty had made her attractive to the mass media and an unexpectedly useful servant of the cause.","3558","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"In England, en route to India at the beginning of 1957, Steinem discovered that she was pregnant by her erstwhile fiancé. She ended the pregnancy when a doctor, at considerable risk to himself, referred her for an abortion, in a country where, as in the United States, abortions were still illegal when the life of the mother was not at stake. The doctor, knowing only that she “had broken an engagement at home to seek an unknown fate,” exacted two promises from Steinem: “First, you will not tell anyone my name. Second, you will do what you want to do with your life.” For nearly ten years, nobody, not even her closest friends, knew that she had had an abortion.","3559","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"In 1968, Clay Felker, the former features editor of Esquire, founded New York and invited Steinem to join his editorial board. “There was Clay, Pete Hamill, Jimmy Breslin, Tom Wolfe, a few other guys, and me,” she said. Four years earlier, she had covered one of her first political campaigns, when Bobby Kennedy was running for senator in New York (an experience she still sums up as sharing a taxi with Gay Talese and Saul Bellow, to whom Talese said, “You know how every year there’s a pretty girl who comes to New York and pretends to be a writer. Well, Gloria is this year’s pretty girl”).","3560","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"“I was doing politics, but even at the magazine I was still the girl writer,” she said, “and the guys there, whom I loved, their advice about feminism was, ‘Don’t get involved with those crazy women.’ I thought, These guys are my friends, and they don’t know who I am, because I haven’t said. So I covered an abortion-rights speak-out at Judson Memorial Church, in Greenwich Village. Courtesy of that meeting, I learned that one in three American women had needed an abortion at some point in her life. The question was: Why is this illegal? I could see from my response to the meeting, and the response of the others, that we as women needed to talk about ourselves.” The article that Steinem wrote that week counts among the first mainstream reporting on the women’s movement.","3561","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"There are certain “mothers” of second-wave feminism, and who they are depends largely on whom you ask. If you ask an academic, she might say Simone de Beauvoir, whose book “The Second Sex” was published in French in 1949 (and in English four years later). If you ask a middle-class suburban housewife of the postwar generation, she is likely to credit Betty Friedan, whose “The Feminine Mystique” appeared in 1963. But if you ask American feminists who came of age in the seventies they will as often as not tell you that the movement came to political life when Gloria Steinem first said, “If it’s not good for all women, it’s not good for any living thing.”","3562","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Beauvoir brought a philosophical and biological history of “female” to the table, lived and travelled with the philandering Jean-Paul Sartre, and was not much given to the cause or company of other women. Friedan brought the career ambitions of white, well-to-do women like her, craved the spotlight, and eventually was written off by much of the movement as a “glass-ceiling feminist.” But what Steinem brought, as a writer, an organizer, and an activist, was the then radical conviction that gender, race, class, age, and ethnicity were all targets of inequality, and belonged together in any over-arching struggle for human and civil rights.","3563","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"In December, 1971, a forty-page preview issue of what would become Ms. appeared as a supplement in the year-end issue of New York. (“Ms.” was a status-free form of address dating from the seventeenth century. In 1971, the New York Democratic congresswoman and take-no-prisoners feminist firebrand Bella Abzug introduced the bill that made it legal.) In return for those forty pages, Felker paid for the printing and publishing of the first issue, which went on the stands, at a hundred and forty pages, in January. “Clay had the sense to know that he couldn’t start a women’s magazine,” Steinem said. “He said—I mean this! He said, ‘If more women were imported from the islands, you wouldn’t need a feminist movement, since it’s really all about child care.’ ”","3564","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The cover of the Ms. preview issue was a housewife “goddess,” painted bright blue (the color of Krishna). She had a baby glowing in her belly and eight arms, each one holding up a tool of her unpaid trade: an iron, a steering wheel, a mirror, a ringing phone, a clock, a duster, a frying pan, and a typewriter. The features included Jane O’Reilly’s instant classic “The Housewife’s Moment of Truth”; Steinem’s essay “On Sisterhood”; a feminist evaluation of the Presidential candidates that year; and a declaration, “We Have Had Abortions,” that was signed by Steinem and fifty-two other well-known women, among them Nora Ephron, Lee Grant, Lillian Hellman, Billie Jean King, and Anaïs Nin. The issue sold out in eight days. Within a few years, there were half a million subscribers.","3565","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Once a month, Steinem spends an evening with a few old friends from the magazine. She calls those evenings “our group-therapy sessions,” and by the time I joined them one night, she was sharing desserts with Joanne Edgar and Suzanne Braun Levine.","3566","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Levine was the editor of Ms. for its first seventeen years. She arrived there a magazine veteran. “I was lucky,” she told me. “I was the right age and had the right amount of experience, and I came with a whole color-coded production chart. I arrived at the office for my interview, and right away Gloria brought me coffee. I never looked back.” Edgar, a founding editor, had met Steinem in the summer of ’71, shortly before the long-anticipated Equal Rights Amendment passed the House of Representatives. (It passed the Senate in the spring, only to be defeated, a few years later, when a state-by-state referendum fell three states short of the number required to become law.) Bella Abzug, rallying America’s feminists to fight with their votes, had helped put together the National Women’s Political Caucus that summer. Steinem, a founding member, travelled the country, organizing and speaking, and Edgar, a Southerner, was dispatched to Mississippi and Missouri to work on political campaigns. Back in New York, after the elections, she joined the ranks of feminists with mattress privileges in the loft that Steinem had built above her dining table and went to work at Ms.","3567","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"A few minutes into dessert, the women began reminiscing about Ms. “before the Australians”—meaning the Australian media group that took over the magazine during a slump in 1987. Two years later, a group of American feminists was able to buy it back, and eventually Steinem helped form a foundation to keep the magazine in print, ad-free, as a monthly. It is a quarterly now, and its moment is in some ways past, but the message it sent was clearly heard, and today mass women’s magazines like Cosmopolitan vet political candidates for their stands on women’s issues, and groups like Emily’s List raise money to rank and support feminists among those candidates.","3568","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"In the early nineties, Steinem decided that something important was missing in the peripatetic life that she describes as “the mixture of freedom and insecurity I needed.” By then, she owned two floors of the brownstone, but the only part that felt like home to her, and not a way station and movement hostel, was her desk and the garden off her study—and that was thanks to a green-thumbed reporter named Irene Kubota Neves, who had interviewed her, years earlier, for People, and, lacking a garden of her own to love, adopted Steinem’s.","3569","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The result was that Steinem went shopping. She started collecting furniture and fabrics. She bought frames for the photographs, pictures, poems, and letters that document the stages of her life on the road, including an almost comically deranged Christmas letter sent in 1971 to friends and family by a right-wing second cousin whom she had met four times, when she was in her teens. After wishing everyone a Merry Christmas, the cousin digressed, accusing Steinem, who at the time was raising money for the Angela Davis defense fund, of letting herself be “brainwashed” into endorsing such an “un-American” cause as the Black Panthers. “Gloria is the first of our name to depart from the American principles as to help our sworn enemies, so we must repudiate her pronouncements and disclaim the cousinship. Love and kisses.” Steinem told me, “I was thrilled to get it. Suppose he had liked me?”","3570","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The walls of her living room are painted a warm, deep Indian yellow. There are pillows everywhere, kilims on the floor, and an old wooden fireplace, with a couple of painted wooden figures, carved like mermaids—“I think from an Indian carrousel,” Steinem told me—lying on the mantelpiece, and, hanging between them, a long, thick, heavily decorated black tunic from Afghanistan, or maybe Kashmir. The room is cozy and crowded. When it gets too crowded, Steinem gives something away. “It’s how I redecorate,” she says.","3571","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Posters cover the walls of the front hall—a time line of the movement as it has changed during the course of her life. For years, Steinem made it a rule never to lecture or organize unless a woman of color was invited with her—a woman who could reach women whose problems of discrimination were far greater than her own—and also for courage, because she is prone to stagefright. (“Ironic,” she told me. “A media worker who loses her saliva before a talk and has to carry a mouth spray in her bag.”) There are posters of Steinem on the road with Dorothy Pitman-Hughes, the African-American activist who had opened a multiracial feminist day-care center in New York, and, later in the seventies, with the great black activist Flo Kennedy (who brought down the house one night when a redneck in the audience demanded to know if she and Steinem were lesbians, and she replied, “Are you my alternative?”). And there are posters from fund-raising galas of the past few decades, when feminism became a fashionable liberal cause, and women with money began sitting on movement boards.","3572","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem welcomed them all—the rich, the celebrities, the climbers for the cause. She was a radical but, consciously, never an outsider. She enjoyed the world where she plied her trade as an entrepreneur of social change, and, with her mouth spray at hand, she had long since mastered the subterfuges of talking truth to power. You could call it consciousness-raising—on a wider canvas. When she went to Los Angeles to speak at a big Equality Now benefit last fall, she told me how much she was looking forward to a meeting with the honchos at Creative Artists Agency the next day. They were going to discuss the status of women in the film industry—their comparatively low numbers, their discrepant salaries—and it didn’t matter if those women were movie stars or grips, or if her meeting required a large application of charm, dazzle, and good humor. She was ready for that.","3573","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"For Steinem, the “conflagration of consciousness” that transformed second-wave feminism into a national movement occurred on November 18, 1977, when Bella Abzug—having persuaded Congress to authorize, and fund, a National Women’s Conference, in Houston—took the stage. It was an occasion that Steinem describes in her new book, beginning with the sentence “This conference may take the prize as the most important event nobody knows about.” Steinem had already spent nearly a year organizing with Abzug, her congressional colleagues Patsy Mink and Shirley Chisholm, and a commission, appointed by President Carter, asking other American women what they, as women, wanted. She had travelled, state by state, to insure a more or less consistent process for the election of Houston delegates, and discovered, to her shock, the extent to which grass-roots groups of ultra-conservative women were prepared to co-opt that process—or, as she puts it, “Success can be as disastrous as failure—and it almost was.”","3574","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Two thousand official delegates came to the conference to discuss and vote on twenty-six different planks, from child care and lesbian rights, to foreign policy, and they were joined by eighteen thousand observers, making it, Steinem says, “probably the most geographically, racially, and economically representative body this nation has ever seen.”","3575","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem describes her “surprise duty” at the conference as that of a scribe, since she had been asked by the various caucuses of women of color to collect and coördinate both their particular and their shared concerns and put them together in a plank that would replace the “so-called Minority Women’s Plank” submitted by various state conferences. What Steinem doesn’t describe is the extent of the women’s trust in her to do that. She had fought in solidarity with these women for years. “There is no competition of tears in feminism,” she once told me. “If you’ve suffered discrimination, you’re sensitive to it on every level. I learned feminism largely from black women. Women of color basically invented feminism.”","3576","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The women of color who came as delegates to Houston were scattered across the country. They had never met as a group before. “It was the first time I realized that being a writer was also being an activist,” Steinem told me. The African-American women raised “the umbrella issues of racism and poverty.” The Asian-Americans added language barriers, sweatshops, and isolation. The Chicana women added the ever-present fear of deportation—and of having to leave their children behind to be brought up by strangers. But Steinem says that nothing prepared her for the Native American women, who wanted to protect their languages and their culture, and to reclaim something of the tribal sovereignty guaranteed by the treaties that, as often as not, had betrayed them. They had one of the toughest jobs in Houston: to educate the only country we have, as one of the delegates put it, to the fact that we are also here.","3577","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The conference was a green light for millions of American women, including liberal Republican women—an endangered species now. (Betty Ford, who had campaigned for the E.R.A. and been a strong supporter of abortion rights, spoke there, along with Lady Bird Johnson and Rosalynn Carter.) The N.W.C. delivered a political program that included equal employment, equal pay, and, crucially, full reproductive rights.","3578","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"In the decades since then, feminists here and abroad have travelled, connected, and discovered that, in a new “world economy” of labor migration, immigration, and capital exploitation, women everywhere are at risk. The Global Fund for Women was founded by three Palo Alto feminists in 1987 and Equality Now in 1992, by Jessica Neuwirth, an American lawyer who had worked for Amnesty International; Navi Pillay, a South African lawyer; and Feryal Gharahi, an Iranian women’s-rights lawyer. A year later, the Iraqi-American activist Zainab Salbi put together Women for Women International. The issues for those groups now involve the kinds of violence against women that cross borders and increase as wars proliferate and the gaps in wealth widen.","3579","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"In America, sex trafficking is said to be as high today as in any other country. Honor killings and forced marriages have been reported. Female genital mutilation, which affects ninety per cent of girls and women in countries like Somalia and Egypt, is now practiced within the diaspora here, despite a ban dating from the Clinton Presidency. According to Yasmeen Hassan, the global executive director of Equality Now, and the author of the first book on domestic violence to appear in Pakistan, more than five hundred thousand girls and women in the United States either are at risk of having F.G.M. or have already had it.","3580","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem’s friends say that she can spot a strong feminist like Hassan from a helicopter, the way Sarah Palin claims she can spot a moose. It’s part of Steinem’s organizational agenda, and it can happen anywhere—on the street, or in a restaurant, or in line at a movie, when a stranger comes up to her and they begin to talk. It can even happen on the telephone. Pamela Shifman was a young white American working in South Africa, four years after apartheid ended, as a legal adviser to the parliamentary women’s caucus of the African National Congress, when someone in her office said, “This woman from your country, someone named Gloria Steinem, keeps calling. She wants to be helpful, so here’s her phone number.” Shifman called. “We’d never met, but Gloria was coming to South Africa for a conference, and she said, ‘I can stay on. Just tell me for how long, and let me do whatever you need me for,’ ” Shifman said. “She stayed a week. She worked with me on organizing strategies, and went to meetings with me, from morning to night. The only thing she asked of me was to take her to see the Rain Queen of the Balobedu”—whose job was to make rain, and to carry and pass on the oral history of her people. “Gloria had a ring, from her friend Wilma Mankiller, the Chief of the Cherokee Nation, to give to the queen, and she did.”","3581","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem was determined that I speak with other women who, like Shifman, came of age during the eighties and nineties and are known in the movement as “third wave” feminists. Amy Richards was the first. “The smartest person I know,” Steinem said. Richards went to work for Steinem as a Barnard intern and now works alongside her on nearly every project, while at the same time, with a partner, writing books, running a young-feminist speakers bureau called Soapbox, and shepherding groups of college students through an intensive week of consultations and tough encounters at a Feminist Boot Camp.","3582","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"One night, Steinem crossed Central Park to visit Jessica Neuwirth, the later second-wave feminist who co-founded Equality Now but who, in the spirit of the third wave, had launched an online feminist nonprofit called Donor Direct Action, designed to connect donors with the grass-roots groups they support abroad. Neuwirth was grappling with a crisis involving one of her most at-risk recipient groups—a highly visible women’s-rights organization in Libya, whose director, Salwa Bugaighis, a fearless lawyer, had just been murdered by five assassins in her home, in Benghazi; Bugaighis’s husband had been abducted and her sister threatened that she was “next.”","3583","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Neuwirth had also invited Navi Pillay over and she wanted Steinem and Pillay—until last year, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights—to help talk her through her choices and advise her on what to do to avoid exposing any successors to Bugaighis to the same risks. Steinem pointed out that every feminist active in Libya knew them, and, by being active, had chosen to take them on. Pillay listened, reserving judgment. Ten days later, Neuwirth introduced her donors to the Salwa Fund, using a video made by Bugaighis before her death. The video was now called “Rest in Peace, Salwa.” And the crisis remains unresolved.","3584","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Ai-jen Poo, the advocate for domestic workers and caregivers who won a MacArthur “genius award” last year, was another woman on Steinem’s list. Poo had started organizing as a student, and at twenty-two, with a grant from the Ms. Foundation, she began to organize domestic workers nationally—ninety per cent of them minority women—into associations. Today, at forty-one, she is the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, with forty-seven affiliates across the country, representing fifteen thousand members. Poo once described Steinem to me as the feminist “who broke down all the silos of separation”—a second-wave feminist with a third-wave commitment to collective leadership and voice. “A lot of people talk about ‘network theory’ now,” she said. “It’s become an all-feminist strategy. But Gloria was always dedicated to lifting other women up, to sharing leadership with them. It was never about herself. And, because of that, for young feminists, it’s the new norm.”","3585","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"This was evident when three of those younger feminists arrived at Steinem’s house one night for a few hours of vegetarian take-out, catching up, and sharing stories. Salamishah Tillet, a professor of English and African Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, came with her sister Scheherazade, an artist-in-residence at the Art Institute of Chicago. Scheherazade is the director of A Long Walk Home, the nonprofit they founded together, “to educate, inspire, and mobilize young people to end violence against girls and women.” Salamishah, six months pregnant with her second child (her husband was at home with the first), reluctantly took the roomiest armchair, at Steinem’s urging. Scheherazade tucked herself into the corner of a couch. Pamela Shifman, who is now the executive director of NoVo Foundation, one of America’s largest nonprofits for girls and women (it was founded by Warren Buffett’s son Peter and Peter’s wife, Jennifer), opted for the floor, having made the shortest commute, from Brooklyn. And the playwright and performer Sarah Jones, best known for her Tony Award-winning multi-character piece “Bridge & Tunnel,” joined us, by way of a Skype video stream, from the West Village, where she was in jet-lag meltdown after three weeks in Europe, interviewing prostitutes for a new show she was developing called “Sell/Buy/Date.”","3586","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Jones had spent some of her trip sitting in a red-lit storefront window in Amsterdam, soliciting. “I wanted to have this experience,” she told her friends at Steinem’s. But it was the prostitutes themselves—“the politics” of their indoctrination—who unsettled her. “It was very fraught for me to hear them rage against the anti-trafficking movement in America,” Jones said. “They talked about ‘sex workers’ rights’ in Western Europe. They said, ‘We are voluntary migrant labor here. We have health care, education, a safety net. We like our jobs.’ I asked those women, ‘If you had a daughter, would you want this for her?’ ”","3587","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The women responded to Jones with some preoccupations of their own. Salamishah, who had been raped herself, talked about rape victims, who become “super invisible,” even and especially to themselves, and asked the group, “How do you intervene without using the language of pathology?” Scheherazade asked, “How do we create” a new language? Steinem quoted the runaway slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman—who, on forays into the South, freed hundreds of other slaves—saying, “I could have saved thousands if only they knew they were slaves.” And Shifman talked about the women who used to be housed at the Bayview Correctional Facility, in Manhattan, across from Chelsea Piers. Bayview, a notoriously cruel women’s prison, was closed three years ago, and its prisoners were transferred. Shifman said that at one point the prison—its women scarred from puberty by the inextricable triad of poverty, prostitution, and drugs—had the highest percentage of staff sexual misconduct of any prison in the United States.","3588","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The conversation was wide-ranging, but by the end of the evening no one, including Jones, knew what, exactly, to make of that week in Amsterdam.","3589","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"It’s safe to say that for feminists in their twenties—think “fourth wave” feminists—social media has put an expiration date on many of the old certainties. The Internet effect has arguably been paradoxical, something that is at once concentrating and diluting the political energy and solidarity of the women’s movement, leaving young women free to confront new issues in necessarily new ways.","3590","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Those issues—sex-work issues, race issues, sexual-assault issues, police-brutality issues, even transgender issues and language-identity issues—have in fact always been movement issues and, in particular, Steinem’s issues. She worked hard to get lesbian rights included in the platform of the N.W.C. in 1977. (Even Friedan, who called lesbians “the lavender menace,” voted for it.) And her record on racism and police brutality has been unimpeachable. (“Violence in any patriarchy begins at home, in the family,” she told me.)","3591","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"She likes to point out that today’s generational byword, “intersectionality,” was in fact coined in the late eighties, by the African-American law professor and race theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw, who used it to describe interconnected forms of discrimination, whose consequences each woman has to balance and negotiate, and feminists have to acknowledge and understand.","3592","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Steinem readily acknowledges that the Internet has been revolutionary in giving feminists—particularly black and gay feminists, who in the past were largely unheard by the mainstream media—a voice, and that some important young feminists are now emerging through platforms like Twitter. But she is wary about calling the Internet effect unequivocally “democratizing,” as many of those feminists claim.","3593","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"“It’s great that we can now sidestep the editorial judgments of the mainstream media,” she told me. “But it’s important to remember that conflict makes news, conflict gets attention, and the Internet thrives on conflict. You have to ask where a lot of these posts about our so-called divisions on issues like race and gender come from. What’s the context? Who’s arguing? And, remember, you have to be able to afford an iPhone or a computer; you have to be literate, which a lot of women in the world are not; and you still have to make change happen in real life, because empathy—the ability not just to know but to feel—only happens when we are together with all five senses. This is part of the reason people can be so hostile to each other on the Web, and women, especially, are subject to so much Web harassment.”","3594","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Two debates that have played out online particularly trouble Steinem. One involves the idea of prostitution as sex work—a legitimate trade that women can decide to practice, and which should be protected through legal regulation, as advocates argue, rather than one that women are forced into, as Steinem is inclined to believe. “The word ‘work’ can be double-edged,” she told me. “The problem of legitimizing the sex trade as work, the way it’s done in Germany, for example, is that ‘work’ has consequences, one being that you are required to do just that—work—and if you refuse to accept a client, or to do something a client wants, you can be fired, or worse.” Then, there’s the matter of choice. Steinem finds it unlikely that anyone actually chooses to be a sex worker, certainly not when she’s twelve years old—roughly the average age of entry into prostitution—or when the rate of trauma and injury among prostitutes is comparable to that of soldiers in wartime, or when what qualifies as consent, in legal terms, may not be consensual at all but enforced. There are exceptions, she says: “Women who make their own arrangements, privately and directly, with a client, and whose only worry is likely to be a big bill from the I.R.S.”","3595","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Late last month, Sarah Jones introduced her working version of “Sell /Buy / Date” at a packed preview, playing fourteen characters, women and men, each with a different story, and view, of his or her experience in the sex trade. After the preview, Steinem joined her onstage for a conversation. She said that the only system that, for now, seems to work for women in the trade and not against them is one called the Nordic Model, which originated in Sweden and has been adopted by several other northern European countries. Sex traffickers, sex-tour managers, brothel owners, and pimps—the people selling the bodies of men, women, and children for their own profit—are arrested. Their clients are fined. The sex workers themselves are free to continue working, and are offered alternative work and training, which they can choose whether or not to take.","3596","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"The other battle that troubles Steinem began in 2008, when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were competing for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Steinem does not officially join political campaigns, on principle, “because if you work on a campaign anything you say reflects on your candidate, and I want—no, I need—to be free to disagree.” But over the years she has stumped independently for countless candidates, as she did for Clinton in the run-up to the Democratic Convention that year (and hopes to do again in the run-up to 2016). Early in the campaign, she had written an Op-Ed in the Times, which the editors entitled, to her surprise and distress, “Women Are Never Front-Runners.”","3597","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"In it, she presented a hypothetical female Obama, with all of Obama’s characteristics and credentials but the Y chromosome—her point being that, at that moment in the country’s history, the combination of “black” and “woman” still amounted to a kind of double negative and would be deadly at the polls. In her view, gender was the greater hindrance. “Actually, I didn’t think either of them had a chance, but if one did it would be Obama,” she told me. “In fact, I said that what we needed was eight years of a President Clinton and eight more years of a President Obama. (When Obama won the nomination, she stumped enthusiastically for him, and, four years later, did it again.) In her Op-Ed, she said that she was backing Clinton, because of her greater experience. “What worries me,” she wrote, “is that he is seen as unifying by his race while she is seen as divisive by her sex. . . . It’s time to take equal pride in breaking all the barriers. We have to be able to say: ‘I’m supporting her because she’ll be a great president and because she’s a woman.’ ”","3598","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Mainstream media paid modest attention to Steinem’s piece. Online, however, it fed a divisive debate that, according to Rebecca Traister, the author of a book about the 2008 campaign, “Big Girls Don’t Cry,” was simmering beneath the surface. Steinem was attacked for being a privileged white woman out of touch with the times.","3599","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"In August this year, Daunasia Yancey and Julius Jones, two young activists from Black Lives Matter, had a backstage confrontation with Hillary Clinton that was taped, and the video made its way online. The subject was “three strikes and you’re out,” a habitual-offenders law introduced by Bill Clinton in 1994 and adopted over the years, in various forms, by twenty-four states. Yancey and Jones accused Hillary Clinton of complicity in that law, which, although it was drafted to discourage serious offenders and keep them off the streets, had in fact contributed to mass incarceration of black men, often for minor offenses, swelling a prison population that was already about fifty per cent black. At the end of a demonstrably tense exchange, Clinton said, “Look, I don’t believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws, you change the allocation of resources, you change the way systems operate.”","3600","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"I asked Alicia Garza, the thirty-four-year-old co-founder of B.L.M.—who also works as the special-projects director of Ai-jen Poo’s National Domestic Workers Alliance—about that exchange. “We have twenty-six chapters nationally, and no one leader speaks for black people,” she said. “But what you saw on that video was the dialectic between policy change and culture change. I was disappointed in Hillary—to be honest, I was sad to see her admonishing two young people. She advocated new laws, when what she should have said is ‘The movement has made this issue front and center and changed my heart.’ Hillary should take notes from Gloria, who has always pushed boundaries around,” Garza, who works closely with Steinem, told me. “Gloria spoke to the fact—it was in her bones—that race was and has to be a feminist issue.”","3601","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"A few days later, Steinem was in New Jersey, giving a talk that ended—as all her talks have since she marched in a Black Lives Matter demonstration—with B.L.M.’s three principles: “Lead with love. Low ego, high impact. Move at the speed of trust.” She also wrote a post on Facebook that read “Trump’s greatest damage to women was to raise sympathy for Carly Fiorina by attacking her appearance. . . . If you thought Republicans could find no woman more damaging to the diversity and needs of the female half of this country than Sarah Palin, take a good look at Carly Fiorina and what she stands for.” Steinem told me that, given platforms like Fiorina’s and those of virtually all the other Republican Presidential candidates—defunding Planned Parenthood, rescinding reproductive rights, abolishing Obamacare, criminalizing immigration, and, with a big nod to industry, denying or ignoring climate change—the left will have to pull together and win.","3602","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"Five years ago, Steinem’s friend Wilma Mankiller died, at the age of sixty-five, with Steinem among the friends and family at her bedside. Mankiller had been the first elected chief of the Cherokee Nation, and she and Steinem had been close ever since she joined the board of the Ms. Foundation. Over the years, Mankiller had become, for Steinem, a kind of spiritual guide—the way Abzug had been her guide through the corridors of Washington power. It was Mankiller, she says, who continued her education in the “deep history” of matrilineality, and the communal talking circles that expressed it. “We have always started our ‘history’ with when hierarchy, patriarchy, and nationalism started,” Steinem told me. “But democracy did not come from Greece. It is much, much older, and it came from women and men together.” She added, “The Iroquois Confederacy had circles of consensus—it was matrilineal.”","3603","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"A few years before Mankiller died, she and Steinem finished an outline and a preface for a book that they were planning to write together. “It was going to be a brief, practical book, citing moments and practices from the past that could be useful to women now,” Steinem said. She intends to finish the book now. “I want to contribute our idea that most of human history was very different from what we have today, with our monotheistic patriarchies and their ‘pyramid’ structures of authority from the top,” she said. “Many peoples were—and some still are—not gender-based in their languages. And there was rarely a single chief. There was always a chief for peace, and a different one for war. Their societies were not polarized, and not violence-based.” The jury is out on that. Many archeologists and anthropologists would disagree. But, as an organizing principle for Steinem, and for the feminists she has brought together, the evocation of an ancient tradition of talking circles for sharing stories, bridging differences, and coming to acceptable common solutions has been a remarkably effective tool.","3604","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"
"One night, I asked Steinem about the future. “I learn, I give,” she told me. “I have the greatest luxury of thinking I might make a difference. I say to myself, ask myself: Can anyone else do what I do? If not, I should keep doing what I can uniquely do. For me, it’s a combination of responsibility and pleasure.","3605","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"

There shouldn’t have been a ‘first’ Gloria Steinem, and there won’t be a last one.” Steinem has placed her house in trust as a place where feminists can meet, work, write, and, if they need to, stay. “I don’t plan to die,” she said, laughing. “I’ll be at home, with those women. I’ll live with them here.” Steinem says, sometimes, that her funeral will be a benefit.","3606","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/road-warrior-profiles-jane-kramer"

"Like many parents, I suspect, my first reaction to the news of the shootings at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, on Thursday was to think of the families of the victims, and my second reaction was to turn away and mutter some obscenities. With the implacable grip that the gun lobby has on Congress, there is virtually no prospect of the United States following the example of nearly every other advanced country and restricting the supply of deadly firearms to civilians. Given that seemingly immutable reality, what is there left to say? Quite a lot, it turns out.","October 2, 2015","3619","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Evidently, President Obama felt the same frustration and hopelessness that many others did. But rather than resigning himself to the situation, he went down to the White House briefing room and issued one of the most powerful statements that he has delivered since taking office. We should be grateful that he did. Even if it doesn’t do much immediate good, it will be there in the record, to remind historians where the primary blame lies for this ongoing national disgrace.","3620","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The President started out by saying some words about the victims and their families, and said, “America will wrap everyone who’s grieving with our prayers and our love.” Then he said, “It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America—next week, or a couple of months from now…. We are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.”","3621","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Earlier this year, the President recalled, he made this point in an interview, noting that the country persists with lax gun laws despite repeated mass killings. “And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day! Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this.”","3622","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Obama’s emotion—his anger—was palpable. He went on: “We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. We need more guns, they’ll argue. Fewer gun-safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?”","3623","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"Whether they believe it or not, supporters of the gun lobby were already out there making this argument—on cable shows, on conservative Web sites, and on social media. Some of them argued that the shooter targeted Umpqua Community College because it was a “gun-free zone,” a claim that has been disputed. Others accused President Obama of playing politics—apparently ignorant of, or oblivious to, the fact that he had already addressed this very criticism.","3624","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"“What’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere, will comment and say, ‘Obama politicized this issue,’ ” the President said. “Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.” He challenged news organizations to “tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.” He went on: “We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?”","3625","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"We all know the answer.","3626","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Republican Party has long exercised a veto on any meaningful addition to the gun laws. And among its current crop of Presidential candidates, there is no sign of anybody breaking ranks. Reaction to the shooting ranged from nonexistent to predictably depressing. As far as I could see, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina, the third- and fourth-place candidates in the polls, didn’t say anything on Thursday about what had happened in Oregon. In a message on Twitter, Jeb Bush called the massacre a “senseless tragedy.” Donald Trump, in an interview with the Washington Post, referred to it as a “terrible tragedy.” He also said, “It sounds like another mental-health problem. So many of these people, they’re coming out of the woodwork.” Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, took a similar line. “Obviously, there are those who are going to be calling for gun control,” he said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.”","3627","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is a familiar trope, of course: it’s not the guns that are the problem, it’s the shooters. There was no suggestion from anybody on the Republican side that what had happened might justify a reconsideration of gun laws, let alone a significant recasting of them. Even those G.O.P. candidates who have previously expressed support for some forms of gun control, such as Chris Christie and George Pataki, didn’t have anything to say on that subject.","3628","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"The Democratic candidates, by contrast, were united in calling for action. Speaking to reporters in Massachusetts, Hillary Clinton said, “We have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe.” She suggested that it wasn’t a hopeless task: “I know there is a way to have sensible gun-control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, and save lives. And I am committed to doing everything I can to achieve that.” Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said in a tweet, “Tweets won’t stop this. Thoughts and prayers won’t either. Only real gun reforms will stop mass shootings from occurring nearly every day.” Bernie Sanders, who has been accused by Clinton allies of shifting his positions on gun control, called for “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.”","3629","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"But Democrats aren’t entirely blameless. After experiencing a political backlash during the nineteen-nineties, when the Clinton Administration pushed through gun-control measures that included a ban on assault weapons, too many members of the Party adopted a craven approach as, during the Bush years, Republicans in Congress rolled back some of the reforms. Even President Obama, who urged for stricter gun control during his 2008 campaign, can’t entirely escape criticism. During his first term, when for two years the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, his Administration didn’t propose any actual gun-control legislation. It wasn’t until 2013, after the massacre in Newtown, that the White House made a serious effort to persuade Congress to act—one that failed in the face of implacable Republican opposition.","3630","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"If you listened closely to Obama on Thursday, you would have noticed that, in his words of anger and despair, he didn’t entirely spare himself, or the rest of us, from responsibility. “This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,” he said. “We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.”","3631","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"That is true. But it is also true, as Obama pointed out, that “this is not something I can do by myself.” To break through the politics of hopelessness, it will evidently take something more than blood—the blood of women, men, children, teachers, pastors, janitors, pensioners, first responders, anybody who happens to be in the way—being shed. “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,” Obama said. “But based on my experience as President, I can’t guarantee that.”","3632","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obama-guns-and-the-politics-of-hopelessness"
"One day last fall, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, appeared on “Meet the Press” to talk about the tense relationship between many African-American communities and the police departments charged with protecting them. In Ferguson, Missouri, the governor had declared a state of emergency as a grand jury considered whether to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American. (In the end, Wilson was not indicted.) Chuck Todd, the host, asked about white officers patrolling African-American neighborhoods, but Giuliani wanted to talk about crime, not punishment. “I find it very disappointing that you’re not discussing the fact that ninety-three per cent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks,” he said, adding, “It is the reason for the heavy police presence in the black community.” The next day, on Fox News, Giuliani said that protesters who chanted “Black lives matter!” should be supporting police officers, not demonizing them. He suggested that the people who really valued black lives were people like him, who worked to reduce the African-American murder rate. “When I came into office, thousands of blacks were being killed every year,” he said. “By the time I left office, it was down to about two hundred.”","3633","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"These comments inspired a backlash, but they were not, in themselves, surprising. Giuliani has never evinced much sympathy for critics of the police; in 2007, when he launched his Presidential campaign, his law-and-order approach helped make him, for a time, the most popular candidate in either party. But the national mood has grown less punitive, and when Giuliani made his remarks last year few allies emerged to support him. Many Republicans, including John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, now say that they support criminal-justice reform; Jeb Bush has signed a reform pledge affirming that prison sentences are “not the solution for every type of offender.” And, among Democrats, fears of being labelled soft on crime seem to have subsided since the nineteen-nineties. As First Lady, Hillary Clinton called for “tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders” while campaigning for her husband’s 1994 crime bill; the law instituted “three strikes and you’re out” sentences, and the federal-prison population almost doubled over the next ten years. But in Clinton’s current Presidential campaign she calls for reforming the police and ending “mass incarceration.” In response to pressure from protesters, she has used the phrase that has come to signify outrage at police brutality: “Black lives matter.”","3634","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"This summer, the Black Lives Matter movement got a literary manifesto, in the form of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “Between the World and Me” (Spiegel & Grau), a slender but deeply resonant book that made its début atop the Times best-seller list. Coates, a writer for The Atlantic, has been chronicling recent police killings, and he has responded with a polemic, in the tradition of James Baldwin, that takes the form of a lyrical letter to his fourteen-year-old son. Coates lists Michael Brown alongside other recent victims: Eric Garner, John Crawford, Tamir Rice, Marlene Pinnock. He writes, “You know now, if you did not before, that the police departments of your country have been endowed with the authority to destroy your body.” And he reminds his son that this destruction is so often unpunished as to be tacitly sanctioned:","3635","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"He means to confirm what his son suspects: that the shocking stories in the news are not anomalous; that police abuse is just another manifestation of the violence that has afflicted black people in America ever since slavery; that officers who kill are not rogues but, rather, enforcers of a brutal social order. One of the most severe lines in the book is also one of the most frequently quoted: “In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body—it is heritage.”","3636","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Four decades ago, a number of black leaders were talking in similarly urgent terms about the threats to the black body. The threats were, in the words of one activist, “cruel, inhuman, and ungodly”: black people faced the prospect not just of physical assault and murder but of “genocide”—the horror of slavery, reborn in a new guise. The activist who said this was Oberia D. Dempsey, a Baptist pastor in Harlem, who carried a loaded revolver, the better to defend himself and his community. Dempsey’s main foe was not the police and the prisons; it was drugs, and the criminal havoc wreaked by dealers and addicts.","3637","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Dempsey is the most vivid character in “Black Silent Majority” (Harvard), a provocative new history by Michael Javen Fortner, a professor of urban studies who wants to complicate our understanding of crime and punishment in black America. He points out that while African-Americans have long been disproportionately arrested and incarcerated for committing crime, they have also, for just as long, been disproportionately victimized by it. His focus is New York in the nineteen-sixties and early seventies, when crime rates shot up, creating a demand in African-American communities for more police officers, more arrests, more convictions, and longer prison sentences. The book begins near the end, on a January day in 1973, when Dempsey joined Governor Nelson Rockefeller at a press conference in support of what became known as the Rockefeller drug laws—a passel of anti-drug statutes that helped make New York a mass-incarceration pioneer, increasing the number of “friskings, detainings, beatings, and humiliations” that Coates writes about.","3638","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Like many scholars and activists, Fortner is profoundly disturbed by our modern system of criminal justice, calling mass incarceration “a glaring and dreadful stain on the fabric of American history.” But he thinks this history is incomplete if it ignores what he calls “black agency”: he wants us to see African-Americans not merely as victims of politics but as active participants in it, too. At a moment of growing concern about how our criminal-justice system harms African-Americans, Fortner seeks to show that African-American leaders, urged on by members of the community, helped create that system in the first place.","3639","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Last year, Coates used his blog to host an online book club devoted to Michelle Alexander’s unsparing “The New Jim Crow,” which came out in 2010 and is still finding new readers. Alexander is a law professor at Ohio State who was radicalized by her time at the American Civil Liberties Union, where she battled racial profiling. She eventually concluded that bias was inherent in the criminal-justice system, and that the system relegated African-Americans to second-class citizenship. The book’s focus was the war on drugs, which helped produce this country’s enormous prison population. She noted that President Reagan made fighting drugs a priority even before anyone was talking about the crack-cocaine epidemic of the nineteen-eighties, and she showed that penalties were disproportionately applied to African-Americans, even though blacks and whites used and sold drugs at roughly equal rates. She argued, convincingly, that our punitive solution to the trade in illegal drugs was an overreaction, and one that would never have been tolerated if more of its victims had been white. She urged activists to fight back in explicitly racial terms, demanding that prison rolls be slashed and police departments remade, not merely in the name of pragmatic reform but in the name of black liberation. In many ways, the Black Lives Matter movement is an answer to her call.","3640","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Coates shares Alexander’s skepticism about law-and-order rhetoric, and he is especially critical of what he has called the “Gospel of Giuliani,” which parries complaints about police and prisons with scary statistics about black people killing black people. In Coates’s view, the term “black-on-black crime” ignores the fact that most violent crime is intraracial, and also obscures the government policies that gave rise to segregated African-American neighborhoods and their high crime rates. “To yell ‘black-on-black crime’ is to shoot a man and then shame him for bleeding,” he writes. The formulation, he believes, encourages us to imagine that something is wrong with black people, instead of seeing that something is wrong with America.","3641","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Coates writes with a preacher’s sensitivity to the rhythms and patterns of language, and of history, too, which means that he slips almost imperceptibly between piercing outrage and something close to fatalism. In his previous book, “The Beautiful Struggle,” Coates described how his boyhood was shaped by his father, Paul Coates, an independent scholar and publisher whose booklist is a bibliography of black liberation. Theirs was not a religious household, and Coates has kept faith with faithlessness, which helps explain his profound distaste for the notion that African-American stories must be redemption stories—what, exactly, makes us think that we shall overcome, some day? “Perhaps struggle is all we have because the god of history is an atheist, and nothing about his world is meant to be,” Coates tells his son in the new book, by way of explaining the importance of fighting a system that can scarcely be fought, let alone beaten.","3642","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Alexander has been accused, credibly, of underplaying the importance and the cost of crime. (Her book begins with the example of Jarvious Cotton, one of more than two million African-Americans who are ineligible to vote because of a felony conviction. She does not mention that Cotton was convicted of murder for the killing of a seventeen-year-old during a mugging.) Coates, though, writes eloquently about common crime, especially in “The Beautiful Struggle.” Readers who come to his first book by way of his second may be taken aback not only by its seriocomic tone and hip-hop-inflected language but also by its vivid evocation of Coates’s boyhood on the gruelling streets of Baltimore. In one memorable passage, he paid dark tribute to the guys from a West Baltimore housing project called Murphy Homes, summoning the fear he felt and the reverence, too:","3643","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"“The Beautiful Struggle” was, no less than its successor, a book about black bodies in peril, although the threats tended to come from within the community. In this world, the police were a menacing presence—after Coates got in trouble in school, his father gave him a beating, asking his mother, “Who would you rather do this: me or the police?”—but Coates seems to have been more concerned about the Murphy Homes boys and the others like them. At one point, he noted that in 1986 there were two hundred and fifty murder victims in Baltimore. “That year,” he wrote, “my man Craig was butchered on his way home from work.” It was a piercing moment, but readers expecting an elegy got, instead, a few terse biographical sentences, as if Coates were underscoring the ghastly banality of this loss.","3644","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Between the World and Me,” Coates shifts his focus from the neighborhood to the nation. The book is given shape and weight by the story of another friend who was killed: Prince Jones, a college acquaintance, shot by an African-American police officer while sitting, unarmed, in his jeep, which apparently matched the description of one driven by a suspect in the theft of a police gun. Coates emphasizes the violence done to the black body to help us see the physical abuse that undergirds broad structures of oppression. Of course, Craig had a body, too, and it was destroyed in a manner far more commonplace. In “Between the World and Me,” the “black body” refers, as well, to the black body politic. When a police officer shoots and kills an unarmed African-American—especially when the officer isn’t charged with a crime, as Michael Brown’s killer was not, and Prince Jones’s killer was not—he is, Coates wants us to understand, proving the continued existence of a system in which African-Americans are victimized by state power and are powerless to demand accountability. A black college student is a body, but he is also a citizen, and this explains why, even in violent neighborhoods, some kinds of violence seem, to Coates, particularly salient: because they threaten not just the body of the victim but his citizenship, too.","3645","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Michael Javen Fortner grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and his boyhood sounds even more chaotic than Coates’s. “I was only a couple of years old when one of my brothers was stabbed to death,” he writes. “I do not remember him, but the pain and sorrow of that day stayed in my home like accumulated dust.” He thinks that analysts like Alexander, in their eagerness to indict systemic injustice, sometimes downplay the “black agony” that characterizes many neighborhoods where brutal crime is ubiquitous. Black political activists present history in ways that emphasize racial solidarity, but Fortner says that the Brownsville he remembers was “a community at war with itself”:","3646","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"It was Richard Nixon who popularized the phrase “silent majority,” as a way of insisting that the countercultural masses protesting the Vietnam War constituted nothing more than an outspoken minority. In positing the existence of a “black silent majority,” Fortner draws on the work of Charles V. Hamilton, an African-American political scientist and the author, with Stokely Carmichael, of “Black Power.” In 1970, Hamilton published an article in the Times Magazine about the mass of black Americans who were concerned about crime. “They want police protection, not police persecution,” he wrote, “and because they believe that the incidence of the latter is greater than the former, they believe the present law-enforcement systems must be viewed suspiciously, rather than optimistically.” In an essay about Harlem, James Baldwin wrote, “The only way to police a ghetto is to be oppressive.” He portrayed the officers as an occupying force: “Their very presence is an insult, and it would be, even if they spent their entire day feeding gumdrops to children.”","3647","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Plenty of citizens and politicians made a different calculation, concluding that the risks of persecution were outweighed by the urgent need for protection. In nineteen-sixties Harlem, heroin addiction was increasing steeply, and street crime had become so common that some churches cancelled evening services, to protect parishioners from being set upon as they returned home. Drug crime strained the relationship between black leaders and white liberal allies, who wanted to combat the drug trade with medical treatment, not criminal penalties. In 1962, Oberia Dempsey led a coalition of civic leaders who asked President Kennedy to “mobilize all law-enforcement agencies to unleash their collective fangs on dope pushers and smugglers.” A group convened by the civil-rights leader A. Philip Randolph urged that “a life time sentence without parole be made the punishment to meet the crime of pushing narcotics.” Testifying at a state hearing in 1969, Hulan Jack—a black state assemblyman representing Harlem, and the former Manhattan borough president—called for life imprisonment for the crime of mugging, and argued that the system of incarceration was not nearly mass enough. (The prison population had been declining despite a sharp increase in arrests.) A 1973 Times poll found that “about three-quarters of New York’s blacks and Puerto Ricans” thought that life without parole was the proper sentence for convicted drug dealers.","3648","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Rockefeller’s drug laws sharply increased the penalties for various drug crimes; possession of four ounces of heroin, for instance, would result in a minimum sentence of fifteen years to life. (In the two decades that followed, the prison rolls in New York quintupled; other states followed, creating a nationwide prison boom.) But Reverend Dempsey, the militant Baptist standing behind Rockefeller on that January day, was not representing the black political establishment. Many of the leaders and groups in Fortner’s book were careful to pair calls for more police with calls for police reform, mindful of the possibility that the “fangs” of law enforcement might sink into the wrong necks. The Rockefeller drug laws passed with hardly any help from black legislators, all but one of whom voted against them. When it counted most, black political support melted away. Fortner hastens to explain that many Democratic legislators had partisan concerns (the bill’s passage was viewed as a Republican victory) and distinct cultural identities—black political élites, he writes, tended to be more optimistic about Harlem than their working- and middle-class constituents were. He points out that a number of community leaders stood with Dempsey to support the bill. And he establishes that black politicians and clergymen helped raise the alarm about drug crime in the first place. Even so, the vote makes it hard to conclude that black political support was decisive in the passage of the Rockefeller drug laws.","3649","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Fortner’s narrative mainly reveals the bleakness of the choices facing black voters and their representatives in those tempestuous years. Statewide rehabilitation efforts had failed, owing in part to lack of funding, and so many civic leaders viewed a new punitive regime as an improvement: it wouldn’t help reform the addicts or dealers, but it might help protect everyone else. A decade later, during the crack years, African-Americans in Congress faced a similarly difficult choice in considering the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. The law established a minimum sentence of five years for trafficking five hundred grams of cocaine or five grams of crack cocaine. Years later, activists criticized this hundred-to-one disparity as unfair to African-Americans, who were more likely to be convicted of selling crack cocaine. But the bill passed with support from two-thirds of the African-Americans then in Congress, including Charles Rangel, from Harlem, whom President Reagan singled out for praise during the signing ceremony.","3650","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"None of this directly refutes Alexander’s argument that the modern carceral state is a new version of Jim Crow. Indeed, Fortner thinks that black leaders, though right to be concerned about crime, were wrong to think that exorbitant mandatory sentences—rather than better-funded rehabilitation programs and structural anti-poverty efforts—were the answer. (Rangel later worked to end the crack-versus-cocaine disparity.) When Alexander calls our criminal-justice system “the new Jim Crow,” she is drawing an imperfect parallel that tells us more about what this system does than about why it exists. It is possible, as Fortner shows, to be skeptical of the drug war while also noting that no small number of its supporters believed, as fervently as any activist today, that black lives matter.","3651","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"On April 12th, in Coates’s native Baltimore, police officers on bicycles noticed an African-American man named Freddie Gray, who saw them watching him and fled. They caught him, found a small knife, arrested him, and put him in a police van to take him to the station. By the time the van arrived there, Gray was unconscious, with his spine nearly severed, and after a week he died from his injuries. The legal reaction came quickly: on May 1st, prosecutors brought charges against six officers, one of whom was charged with second-degree murder. But the first protest began even before Gray died. The uproar seemed to inspire police officers to work more cautiously and, perhaps, to disengage; arrests dropped, and the number of homicides rose. There were forty-two murders in Baltimore in May, compared with twenty-three the previous May; in June, there were twenty-nine, compared with eighteen the year before; in July, forty-five, compared with twenty-two; in August, thirty-three, compared with twenty-six. In four months, sixty more lives were lost than in the previous year, most of them black.","3652","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Near the beginning of “Between the World and Me,” Coates recalls the night the grand jury announced that it would not return an indictment against Darren Wilson for killing Michael Brown. His son retreated to his room to cry, and Coates tried to figure out what to tell him. This book is his response, but it is not until the end that Coates allows, “Michael Brown did not die as so many of his defenders supposed.” A Justice Department report looked at the Ferguson Police Department and found a wide range of abusive practices, as well as “intentional discrimination on the basis of race.” But another Justice Department inquiry debunked the widely reported story that Brown was coöperating, with his hands up—saying, “Don’t shoot!”—when he was killed. And forensic details corroborate the claim that Brown was initially shot while trying to grab the officer’s gun.","3653","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"The ubiquity of video footage has increased the scrutiny of police killings, making it easier for citizens to contest official explanations that would otherwise go unchallenged. Until recently, however, no one kept a complete count of who was being shot by police officers, and why. The Washington Post examined reports of police shootings in 2015 and found that this year blacks were about three times as likely as whites to be killed by police. (Because of the difference in population sizes, non-Hispanic whites still form a plurality—about fifty per cent—of all people killed by police.) A Web site called killedbypolice.net has been tracking media reports of police killings since 2013; it finds that over the past three years blacks were about three and a half times as likely as whites to be killed by police.","3654","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"These findings should disturb us, but so, too, should the fact that the racial disparity is actually wider for civilian violence. Overall, blacks are about eight times as likely as whites to be murdered. As far as we can tell, someone killed by police is less likely to be black than someone killed by a civilian. In “Ghettoside” (Spiegel & Grau), an absorbing new book about murder in an African-American community in Los Angeles, the reporter Jill Leovy writes about what she calls “the black homicide problem.” She doesn’t use this term to defend police departments; on the contrary, she uses it to indict them, writing about all the cruelty and misery that flourishes in a place where there is no “state monopoly on violence.” If anything, the outrage over relatively rare police killings should remind us just how much everyday violence—and just how much everyday inequality—we have learned to ignore.","3655","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Coates’s two books show how twinned fears of crime and punishment can be mutually reinforcing: how the historic failure of the police to keep African-Americans safe from violence can make police excesses all the more appalling. The police killing of Prince Jones was, surely, that much more disturbing to a man who remembered that when he was a boy the police had failed to protect his friend Craig. For some reformers, the key is retraining police officers to minimize violence. But Coates and Alexander warn against this kind of meliorist thinking. “A reform that begins with the officer on the beat is not reform at all,” Coates has written. To many Black Lives Matter activists, the phrase “state monopoly on violence” probably sounds more like a threat than like a reassurance.","3656","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Crime statistics in Baltimore are complicated: in the decades since Coates was a boy, murders declined, but so did the city’s population. In general, though, American crime rates have fallen since the early nineteen-nineties, and the nation’s imprisoned population—while extraordinarily high, by global standards—seems to have stopped increasing. As for police killings, each one is tragic, and each unjustified one is outrageous; police departments in Europe, for instance, are vastly less likely to kill. But there is no evidence that we are living through a modern epidemic. Although there is little reliable national data, the New York Police Department keeps records. In 1973, the year Rockefeller signed his drug laws, the department shot and killed fifty-eight people; in 2013, the most recent year in the department database, the number was eight. The Black Lives Matter protests draw their urgency from the damage that violence has done to African-American communities. But they resonate so widely because, after decades of chaos, that violence seems to have subsided.","3657","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"
"Experts disagree about how much of this change can be attributed to policing or to mass incarceration; in many ways, crime rates are mysterious. But the decades-long decrease in crime has made it much easier for politicians to heed the activists demanding that we reform our criminal-justice system. There is some indication that this year many cities besides Baltimore are suffering from an uptick in homicides; if this trend were to continue, talk of ending mass incarceration might become politically toxic, even for African-American politicians. As Fortner’s book makes clear, no political movement can afford to ignore the kind of cruel disorder that we euphemistically call common crime. A police force that kills black citizens is adding to America’s history of racial violence; so is a police force that fails to keep them safe. Alexander may be right that our criminal-justice regime is a new incarnation of the monstrous old Jim Crow system. But this should tell us something about the desperation of the many African-Americans who supported it anyway—convinced, not wholly unreasonably, that the alternative was even worse. ♦","3658","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/body-count-a-critic-at-large-kelefa-sanneh"

It was used against—speaking of France!—Senator John Kerry, whose absenteeism in 2004 was worse still. More to the point, it was used against Senator John McCain, who missed three-fifths of the votes the Senate took while he was a candidate in the 2008 campaign.

The Upshot concludes that “Mr. Cruz’s debate style is much more complicated than that of his fellow Republican candidates, close to works like Beowulf and Don Quixote.” Beelzebub and Don Knotts is closer to the mark, but the oleaginous Texan is inarguably erudite.","3673","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"It’s possible that, at some point in the past half-century or so, some important major-party American politician—Daniel Patrick Moynihan would be a prime suspect—has publicly uttered the word “Bolsheviks.” But “Mensheviks”? Not likely.","3676","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"The Bolsheviks (the name derives from the Russian for big, or majority) were the ultra-radical faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party and the direct ancestor of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Mensheviks (small, or minority) were the not-so-radical faction. They were the Russian cousins of the social democrats of Europe—Britain’s Laborites, Germany’s SPD, France’s SFIO (now the Socialist Party), and the parties that made Scandinavia what it is today.","3678","http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-republican-debate-footnotes"

"As for Hillary, she doesn’t fit either half of Cruz’s formula. Her closest analogue in early-twentieth-century Russia would be the Constitutional Democrats, Kadets for short, the party of the liberal bourgeoisie.

The Bolshevik deputies in the State Duma were strangers to any notion of reaching across the aisle. The Bolsheviks were extremists. When they couldn’t get their way, they shut down the government. They had no problem with repudiating the public debt. They stockpiled guns. They were ideologically rigid fanatics who regarded those who disagreed with them, however slightly, as enemies.

"Donald Trump was at his most bombastic this week in Washington. “We are led by stupid, stupid people—very, very stupid people,” he shouted at a rally on Wednesday held to protest the Iran nuclear deal. Three days earlier, he had embarrassed himself—if he is capable of embarrassment—by commenting on a recent SurveyUSA poll showing that he would beat Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head race. “Thank you!” he tweeted, with a link to an article about the poll. The story he cited was actually from Iran’s Press TV, the English-language and quasi-propagandistic news outlet of the Iranian regime.","September 11, 2015","3709","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"At the rally, which was held on the steps of the Capitol, Trump called the agreement between Iran and the world’s six major powers the worst deal—of any kind, apparently—in his lifetime. “So I’ve been doing deals for a long time,” he told the crowd. “I’ve been making lots of wonderful deals, great deals. That’s what I do. Never, ever, ever in my life have I seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran. And I mean never.”","3710","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"The shallowness (and callousness) of Trump’s grasp of foreign policy became even clearer when he addressed the complex issue of American hostages detained in Iran, including a former F.B.I. agent who was last sighted there. “If I win the Presidency, I guarantee you that those four prisoners are back in our country before I ever take office,” he said at the rally. “They will be back before I ever take office, because they”—the Iranians—“know that’s what has to happen, O.K.?

In every case, the hostages’ releases involved intricately orchestrated negotiations done through hundreds of channels and dozens of countries, and which often spanned years. After Trump’s speech, I asked some former hostages and U.S. officials involved in past and current hostage crises what they thought of Trump’s hostage policy.","3712","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"“It doesn’t make sense,” Terry Anderson, America’s longest held hostage, told me. In 1985, Anderson was kidnapped in Beirut, where he was the Associated Press bureau chief, by Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy. “The Iranians aren’t at Trump’s beck-and-call, and they won’t be if he’s elected President,” Anderson said. “It’s so idiotic that I don’t know how to address it. One of the first things a President learns when he comes into office is that he can’t simply order things and make them happen—in our government, let alone anyone else’s.”","3713","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"Anderson’s release involved a special U.N. envoy travelling the world, interventions by dozens of countries, and a war (not involving Iran) that altered the terms of the negotiations. The process took seven years, spanning two Presidencies.

"Others called Trump’s boast dangerously counterproductive. Haleh Esfandiari, who was the director of Middle East programs at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, in Washington, was detained in Tehran while visiting her ailing ninety-three-year-old mother, in 2007. She was held for eight months, including for more than a hundred days in solitary confinement, at Tehran’s Evin Prison, which has become notorious for holding political prisoners following the revolution, in 1979. She called Trump’s claims “frivolous and irritating” and added, “This is of no help to the Iranian Americans in prison in Iran and is certainly not going to get them free.”","3715","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"John Limbert was one of the fifty-two Americans held for four hundred and forty-four days during the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. He called Trump naïve. “The problem is that it’s always Iran’s decision on criteria [for freeing hostages], which we don’t know now and have never understood very well,” he said. “It’s easy for him to say these things, but it doesn’t help the detainees to make glib comments.”","3716","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"Ronald Reagan, Limbert said, exploited the first hostage drama during the 1980 Presidential campaign but ended up implementing the terms agreed to by Jimmy Carter in order to win the hostages’ freedom. Six years later, Reagan engaged in his own arms-for-hostage swap with Iran to win freedom for three Americans kidnapped in Beirut.

"At the rally, Trump implied, without mentioning specifics, that he’d threaten whatever it took to win freedom for hostages and detainees. Sarah Shourd, who was one of the three American hikers detained in Iran, in 2009, told me this week, “The U.S. government threatening Iran has never resulted in any hostages being released, or any progress in negotiations on larger issues. U.S. bullying only strengthens the position of hard-liners in Iran’s government: that the U.S.’s agenda is not to find common ground but to dominate.”","3718","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"The Michigan congressman Dan Kildee, a Democrat, has been deeply involved in the current case of Amir Hekmati, a former Marine who has spent four years in an Iranian prison. Born in Arizona, Hekmati served in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He went to Iran to visit his ailing grandmother in 2011. He was picked up just days before he was scheduled to fly home to start school at the University of Michigan. “It’s a thorny set of issues,” Kildee told me.","3719","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"Hekmati was charged with espionage, waging war against God, and corrupting the earth. In 2012, he was sentenced to death. The sentence was overturned on appeal.

"“It’s particularly dangerous for Trump or any candidate to use the status of these Americans and the pain their families have been experiencing to advance his own political purposes,” Kildee said. “My effort to free Amir has been a bipartisan effort.”","3721","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"This summer, Kildee won unanimous support in the House for a resolution on the Americans held in Iran. “It’s not the loudest voice or the most caustic language that gets things done, whether in domestic policy or international relations,” Kildee said. “It takes more than holding the microphone to actually make progress in this country. Name-calling should not have a place in American political space—especially in a subject as sensitive as Iran nuclear negotiations or the status of Americans held against their will.”","3722","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"More troubling than Trump’s ignorance, perhaps, is his disdain toward learning the basics of foreign policy—not only when it comes to Iran, but regarding all national-security challenges. In an interview last week with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump failed to recognize the name of Qassem Soleimani, the infamous commander of Iran’s Quds Force, the élite arm of the Revolutionary Guards, which has plotted against American forces and the country’s interests throughout the Middle East. Trump then confused the Quds Force with the Kurds, who are allied with the United States.","3723","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-bluster-on-iran"
"Hewitt pressed Trump on whether he even knew the players—including the leaders of Hezbollah, Al Qaeda, the Al Nusra Front, and the Islamic State—without a scorecard. “No, you know, I’ll tell you honestly,” Trump replied. “I think by the time we get to office, they’ll all be changed.

"Today, Joe Biden announced that he would forgo a Presidential run, and he made a similar case that America is being damaged by excessive partisanship. “I believe that we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart,” Biden said, in remarks in the Rose Garden. “And I think we can. It’s mean-spirited, it’s petty, and it’s gone on for much too long. I don’t believe, like some do, that it’s naïve to talk to Republicans. I don’t think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition. They’re not our enemies. And for the sake of the country, we have to work together. As the President has said many times, compromise is not a dirty word. But look at it this way, folks: How does this country function without consensus? How can we move forward without being able to arrive at consensus? Four more years of this kind of pitched battle may be more than this country can take. We have to change it. We have to change it.”","3728","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"Finally, over in the House, as the majority party struggles to find a new Speaker, Congressman Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, floated the intriguing idea of putting together a “bipartisan coalition” to elect the next leader. He called it “basic math”: if Republicans don’t have two hundred and eighteen votes for a Speaker, they will need to nominate a candidate that can win some votes from Democrats. If Paul Ryan, who laid out several conditions in order for him to formally enter the race for Speaker, decides against running—or if he is defeated—then perhaps Dent’s idea will gain currency. For now, it seems as dead as Biden and Webb’s candidacies.","3729","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"The dilemmas faced by Webb, Biden, and Dent were different in many ways, but common to all three is a familiar structural fact of American politics that is making centrist politics seem increasingly out of reach and anachronistic. In 1950, the American Political Science Association published a major report on the state of America’s two-party system. The authors worried that the public had little idea what to expect when they voted for a Democrat or a Republican, because each party was a mish-mash of interests with little ideological consistency. What was needed in American politics were parties with more “internal cohesion,” so that when one party was in control the average voter would understand generally where it stood on the major issues. In addition, the party out of power needed to present sharp differences. The report said, “The fundamental requirement of accountability is a two-party system in which the opposition party acts as the critic of the party in power, developing, defining, and presenting the policy alternatives which are necessary for a true choice in reaching public decisions.”","3730","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"The report had many recommendations about improving politics in America, but the basic headline was one that seems amusing today: America wasn’t polarized enough. Starting in the seventies, that all began to change. This graph from the Pew Research Center documents how the two parties, which were once both coalitions of liberals and conservatives, gradually began to pull apart until they were perfectly sorted: all liberals are now in the Democratic Party and all conservatives are now in the Republican Party. There is no longer any middle.","3731","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"This great hollowing out of the political center helps to explain the week’s events. Webb’s analysis about independents being the greatest bloc of votes in America is wrong. Most self-described independents act like partisan Democrats or Republicans, but they simply don’t like to use the party labels. Webb will have no more success running as a third-party candidate than he did running as a Democrat.","3732","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"Biden’s dilemma is that he seemed to want to be the nominee of his party without having to do the necessary work of wooing the partisans that dominate the process. In his speech, he indirectly criticized Hillary Clinton, who recently joked that Republicans are her enemy. It’s a fair criticism, but Clinton will likely be the nominee of her party because she has been doing the gruelling work of putting together the coalition of partisans who will decide the Democratic primary.","3733","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"
"Over in the House, Dent’s proposal for a bipartisan Speaker has little chance of success, for similar reasons. The differences inside the G.O.P., where forty or so right-wing members are holding out support in exchange for concessions from the new Republican Speaker, are minor in comparison to the ideological differences between the two parties.","3734","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-center-is-dead-in-american-politics"

"In January, 2007, Barack Obama posted a video to his Web site revealing that he was serious about running for President. His choice of venue was notable. Obama was only the second major candidate to form a Presidential exploratory committee; the previous month, John Edwards had announced the formation of his own committee from the yard of a home that had been destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. After Obama’s declaration, an editor at Time magazine wrote in a blog post, “My first impression is that he’s smart to do it this way rather than … on Oprah or some other contrived venue.” The implication was that the clip on Obama’s own Web site was more natural and spontaneous-seeming than an announcement on a major TV program.","October 20, 2015","3736","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"The writer of that post was named Jay Carney, and, if the past several years are any indication, he has only become more enthusiastic about the potential that digital media offers to important people to directly disseminate, and thus control, their own messages. In 2011, Carney became President Obama’s press secretary, and during his three-year tenure in that post he and his colleagues used social media to pull off a remarkable trick: giving the Obama Administration a reputation among the public for openness while at the same time allowing reporters precious little access to the White House. On Instagram and other media platforms, Obama’s team published candid-seeming images and messages that cast the President as authentic and down to earth—playing by the pool with one of his daughters; meeting a young cancer patient; tweeting about the child of someone who died for lack of health-insurance coverage.","3737","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"Meanwhile, in 2013, dozens of major outlets complained to Carney, in a hand-delivered letter, about “the troubling breadth of the restrictions placed upon newsgathering by the White House to record governmental activity of undisputed and wide public interest.” The letter protested, in particular, the Obama Administration’s practice of barring photojournalists from capturing events that were deemed “private,” and then using its own employees to shoot the same events—among them, meetings with the activist Malala Yousafzai, with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, and with Hillary Clinton, who had by then left her post as Secretary of State—and share them on social-media channels. “You are, in effect, replacing independent photojournalism with visual press releases,” the letter read.","3738","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"In 2014, Carney left his post at the White House, and in the spring of this year he joined Amazon.com as the senior vice-president of worldwide corporate communications, charged with making comments to top press outlets and shaping Amazon’s communications plan. On Monday, he posted an unorthodox piece on the Web site Medium, in which he questioned the credibility of several sources in a Times article, published in August, about Amazon’s challenging workplace culture. (A disclosure: I have a short-term contract doing some editing for Medium.) In the article, for which the reporters Jodi Kantor and David Streitfeld talked to more than a hundred current and former Amazon employees, the company’s culture is described as “bruising.” A former marketing employee named Bo Olson told Kantor and Streitfeld, “Nearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk.”","3739","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"In his rebuttal, Carney writes that the article “misrepresented Amazon,” and takes the unusual approach of attempting to discredit a small number of the workers with whom Kantor and Streitfeld spoke, in part by referring to those individuals’ employment records at Amazon. The most damning detail by far is Carney’s description of Olson, who he describes as having left the company “after an investigation revealed he had attempted to defraud vendors and conceal it by falsifying business records.”","3740","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"Within hours, the Times’s top editor, Dean Baquet, had responded to Carney’s post—not on the newspaper’s own Web site, as one might expect, but on Medium. (Baquet was later interviewed for a Times article about the back-and-forth.) Baquet defended the original article, pointing out that Carney hadn’t pointed out any inaccuracies, and writing that Olson had, on Monday, told the Times that “he was never confronted with allegations of personally fraudulent conduct or falsifying records.” (Olson also declined to comment for the Times follow-up article; he didn’t respond to a Facebook message that I sent him.) Carney, not one to forfeit the last word, then responded to Baquet in a follow-up post.","3741","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"Carney is one of several high-profile D.C. operatives who have gone to work in the tech sector in recent years.* In 2014, the car service Uber hired David Plouffe, who had previously run Obama’s 2008 campaign and later worked in his Administration. For tech companies, the most obvious benefit of hiring from the White House is the possibility that the new employees’ expertise and connections will help them win regulatory battles. But Carney’s piece indicates that he is bringing to Amazon another aspect of his experience both at the White House and as a journalist: his knack for coming across as transparent and concerned with the truth, even as he bypasses traditional journalism operations by using Internet platforms that allow him to put forth his own narrative. He even seems to be adapting some of the tricks from his White House playbook—using a conversational style, as in Obama’s tweets, and insider details, as in the White House photos posted to Instagram and elsewhere, to create a shareable piece of writing that comes across as authentic and candid. (Of course, it’s possible that Carney tried to get his piece published in a traditional press outlet and was rejected; if so, that only underscores the usefulness of Medium and other sites like it in helping corporations get their message out.) Indeed, as soon as Carney posted his piece it went viral, becoming, within hours, one of the most-shared posts on Medium. People immediately started deconstructing the original Amazon article. Was it credible or not? Is Amazon’s workplace culture bruising or not?","3742","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"Carney’s piece was notable for its style, its methods, and its target, but Amazon is not the only corporation to have aired its complaints directly to the public because it felt as though a news outlet had misrepresented it. Only days before Carney’s post, the high-profile blood-testing startup Theranos published on its Web site a denunciation of a Wall Street Journal exposé that raised questions about the accuracy of its tests. (Theranos used a similar tactic to Amazon’s, questioning the credibility of the Journal’s sources without pointing to specific errors in its reporting.) Not long ago, companies that felt they had been wronged by a news outlet could do little in response, besides requesting a correction, penning a letter to the editor, or, in extreme cases, taking out an ad. Now they can present their version directly to readers—on their own Web sites or on platforms like Medium, Twitter, and Facebook.","3743","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"Is Carney’s blog post, and others like it, a positive contribution to the public discourse or a perversion of it? On the face of it, responses like his offer a challenge to the project of journalism. While the news organizations covering companies are motivated by the pursuit of truth, and, at least at the largest among them, employ rigorous editing, fact-checking, and legal vetting in that pursuit, companies themselves are propelled by the pursuit of profits, and have been known to bend the truth or to present a part of it which serves their interests. While Carney, in this case, employs the rhetoric of journalism—the proliferation of facts, the readable tone—he is acting as a corporate spokesman, not a journalist. But then, the perspective that Carney’s piece shouldn’t be trusted is complicated by the fact that he presents specific evidence that would seem to put into question at least one source’s credibility (even as the source, according to Baquet, denies being confronted with the allegations against him). If a corporation is presenting information that wasn’t previously available, doesn’t that serve the public interest—especially given that others, including the Times, are welcome to chime in?","3744","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"In the current media landscape, it’s hard to imagine many readers taking Carney’s post at face value, without examining its broader context. But the balance of power between traditional media outlets and social-media ones is shifting, and that could have profound implications for how people access important information. Some have wondered why Carney bothered to publish his rebuttal a full two months after the Times article ran. One explanation could be that he’s trying to get ahead of potential recruitment issues. A Google search for “Amazon” and “New York Times” delivers Kantor and Streitfeld’s article—but, as of Tuesday, it also turns up Carney’s Medium piece and several articles about it. Platforms like Medium, along with Twitter and other such sites, tend to rank highly in search sites’ algorithms, in part because of the sheer number of people who visit and link to them—and these sites are often the venue of choice for companies hoping to directly present their own perspectives.","3745","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"At present, articles from the Times and other respected publications also do well in search results, and tend to be advantaged by the algorithms that dictate what shows up places like Facebook news feeds. But it’s not at all hard to imagine a future in which the influence of traditional news outlets—and, in turn, their prominence in search results and social-media feeds—diminishes. Could there be a time when a search for information about a corporation turns up mostly the material that the company has disseminated itself using social media?","3746","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"
"The White House’s approach, under Carney, of closing off media access to certain meetings offers a window into how that might look. Two years after Obama’s meeting with Clinton, a Google search for images from the get-together turns up only one anodyne image, originally posted on Twitter: Obama and Clinton lounging at an outdoor table, smiling at each other over plates of salad. At the time, journalists wondered what the two had discussed—Clinton’s Presidential prospects in 2016? The peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians that had just begun?—but a spokesman called the lunch “chiefly social.” If anything newsworthy happened there, Carney and his colleagues made sure that it would be hard to find out.","3747","http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-did-jay-carney-use-medium-to-criticize-the-new-york-times"

"When Jorge Ramos travels in Middle America, nobody recognizes him—until somebody does. Ramos is the evening-news co-anchor on Univision, the country’s largest Spanish-language TV network, a job he has held since 1986. A few weeks ago, I was on a flight with him from Chicago to Dubuque. Ramos, who is fifty-seven, is slim, not tall, with white hair and an unassuming demeanor. Wearing jeans, a gray sports coat, and a blue open-collared shirt, he went unremarked. But then, as he disembarked, a fellow-passenger, a stranger in her thirties, drew him aside at the terminal gate, speaking rapidly in Spanish. Ramos bowed his head to listen. The woman was a teacher at a local technical college. Things in this part of Iowa were bad, she said. People were afraid to leave their houses. When they went to Walmart, they only felt comfortable going at night. Ramos nodded. Her voice was urgent. She wiped her eyes. He held her arm while she composed herself. The woman thanked him and rushed away.","3750","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"

"In an Italian restaurant on a sleepy corner in downtown Dubuque, a dishwasher came out from the kitchen toward the end of lunch to pay her respects. She, too, fought back tears as she thanked Ramos for his work. He asked her how long she had been in Iowa. Five years, she said. She was from Hidalgo, not far from Mexico City, Ramos’s home town. She hurried back to the kitchen.","3752","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"“We have almost no political representation,” Ramos said. He meant Latinos in the United States. “Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz won’t defend the undocumented.”","3753","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"“A Country for All,” Ramos’s most recent book—he has published eleven—is dedicated to “all undocumented immigrants.” He was trying to explain how a journalist finds himself in the role of advocate.","3754","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"“We’re a young community,” he said. “You wouldn’t expect ABC, or any of the mainstream networks, to take a position on immigration, health care, anything. But at Univision it’s different. We are pro-immigrant. That’s our audience, and people depend on us. When we are better represented politically, that role for us will recede.”","3755","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Besides co-anchoring the nightly news, and cranking out books, Ramos hosts a Sunday-morning public-affairs show, “Al Punto” (“To the Point”), and writes a syndicated column; for the past two years, he has also hosted a weekly news-magazine show, “America with Jorge Ramos,” in English, on a fledgling network (a joint venture of Univision and ABC) called Fusion. (When Jon Stewart asked him, on “The Daily Show,” to account for his hyperactivity, Ramos said, “I’m an immigrant. So I just need to get a lot of jobs.”) His English is fluent, if strongly accented. His Spanish, particularly on-air, is carefully neutral—pan-Latino, not noticeably Mexican. Univision’s audience comes from many different countries, and the network broadcasts from Miami, where the most common form of Spanish is Cuban.","3756","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos occupies a peculiar place in the American news media. He has won eight Emmys and an armload of journalism awards, covered every major story since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and interviewed every American President since George H. W. Bush. (He’s interviewed Barack Obama half a dozen times.) But his affiliation can work against him. In June, when he sent a handwritten letter to Donald Trump, who had just launched his Presidential campaign, requesting an interview, it was no dice. Univision had cut its business ties with Trump, including its telecasts of the Miss U.S.A. and Miss Universe beauty pageants, after Trump accused Mexico of sending “rapists” to the United States. Trump posted Ramos’s letter on Instagram, crowing that Univision was “begging” him for interviews. The letter included Ramos’s personal cell-phone number, which Ramos was then obliged to change. In the weeks that followed, Trump produced a stream of provocative remarks and proposals about Mexicans and immigration, giving the national immigration-policy debate the hardest edge it has had in generations. Now Ramos really wanted to interview him.","3757","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Trump was planning a rally on Dubuque’s riverfront that afternoon. Ramos and Dax Tejera, a young Fusion executive producer, met up with a local cameraman in the parking lot of the Grand River Center, where a press conference was scheduled in advance of the rally. They went inside early, past some tables where Ann Coulter, who was going to introduce Trump at the rally, was setting up to sign copies of her latest book, “¡Adios, America!: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole.” Ramos, heading upstairs, said, “We had her on our show when that book came out. Trump seems to be getting his ideas from her.”","3758","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"In the room designated for the press conference, Ramos and Tejera considered camera angles and lighting. They staked out a pair of front-row seats. Ramos was studying a sheaf of notes. “Normally, I’d just have a ten-second question prepared,” he said. “But this is not normal. Here I have to make a statement, as an indignant immigrant. Tell him that Latinos despise him. And then I have to ask a question, as a journalist, if he’ll let me.” The room was filling with reporters. Ramos worried that Trump would recognize him and not call on him. “It will be important to stand up,” he said. “Trump’s street-smart. If you’re sitting, he’ll use it, the visual power imbalance, and squash you.” Tejera stationed the cameraman against a wall. “TV is not reality,” Ramos said, miming a frame with his hands. “It’s a way of exaggerating a moment. Reality is what we’re living here. What we’re after is something else.”","3759","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"

"Carl Cameron, of Fox News, asked about a local campaign operative who was leaving Rick Perry’s campaign for Trump’s. The operative joined Trump at the lectern for a couple of questions. Then, as Trump stepped back to the microphone alone, Ramos stood up. “Mr. Trump, I have a question about immigration,” he said. Trump ignored him, scanning the room as if no one had spoken, saying, “O.K., who’s next?” He pointed at someone. “Yeah. Please.”","3761","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"

"The bodyguard went for Ramos, who was still talking. “Those ideas—” The bodyguard, who was a foot taller than Ramos, began to push him backward, out of the room. “I’m a reporter,” Ramos said. “Don’t touch me, sir.” His voice did not rise. “You cannot touch me.” The bodyguard had him by the left arm and was now moving him swiftly toward an exit door.","3772","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"

"In the hallway outside, a middle-aged white man, his face flushed with anger, approached Ramos, jabbing a finger at him. “Get out of my country,” he said. “Get out.” The man had a Trump sticker on his lapel. Ramos studied him curiously. “I’m a U.S. citizen, too,” he said, moving toward the man, as if he wanted to talk. A police officer stepped between them.","3779","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Tejera was on the phone to his boss at Fusion. Ramos, standing alone, seemed to fold into himself. His expulsion had been tense, uncomfortable, heart-pounding stuff. Everyone involved was surely agitated. But Ramos seemed calm, as if his pulse had slowed. A young woman with a news camera approached him for an interview. Perhaps later, he said. Ramos crossed his arms and stared at his shoes. He was wearing pale, low-cut boots. His feet looked very small. I later asked him what he was thinking about then. “I was trying to understand what it meant,” he said. “Trying to know if I had made mistakes. I knew it was right not to sit down. If I had sat down, Latinos would have been so disappointed.”","3780","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"After about ten minutes, a Trump aide, a young woman in black, appeared and walked toward Ramos. “I’m Hope,” she said, smiling and extending a hand, which he took. She invited him to return to the press conference, assuring him that he could ask questions. He just had to wait to be called on. Ramos went back in.","3781","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"While he was outside, two reporters had asked Trump about his ejection. The first, Tom Llamas, of ABC, was a young Latino correspondent from Miami. He described Ramos as “one of our country’s top journalists,” and asked Trump if he thought he had handled the situation correctly. Trump said, “I don’t know really much about him.” He only knew he hadn’t called on the guy. “He just stands up and starts screaming,” Trump said. Anyway, he said, he hadn’t thrown him out: “You’ll have to talk to security. Whoever security is escorted him out.”","3782","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Now Trump called on Ramos, who asked his questions about the wall, birthright citizenship, and mass deportation. How was Trump actually going to do these things? Did he plan to use the Army to round up eleven million people? “We’re going to do it in a very humane fashion,” Trump said. “I have a bigger heart than you do.” The two men talked over each other, with Ramos still asking for specifics. Trump now seemed to know who Ramos was. “You and I will talk,” he said. “We’re going to be talking a lot over the years.” He meant, it seemed, when he was President. “Do you know how many Hispanics work for me?” Trump asked. “They love me.”","3783","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The exaggerated TV moment, I guessed, was “Go back to Univision.” It sounded like “Go back to Mexico.” Trump, rehashing the episode on the “Today” show, called Ramos a “madman.” He told a cheering crowd in Nashville about how he had dealt with the “screaming and ranting” of “this clown, Jose Reyes, or whatever the hell his name is.” The media critic Howard Kurtz, of Fox News, said that Ramos had behaved “like a heckler,” contravening “basic civility” by not waiting to be called on. Marc Caputo, of Politico, assailed Ramos’s open support for immigration reform, tweeting, “This is bias: taking the news personally, explicitly advocating an agenda.” Many conservative commentators, at Fox and elsewhere, agreed. A Washington Post writer called Ramos a “conflict junkie”—like Trump himself. Ramos had his defenders. Glenn Greenwald wrote a piece for The Intercept with the headline “Jorge Ramos Commits Journalism, Gets Immediately Attacked by Journalists.” Greenwald and others pointed to a distinguished tradition of opinion and advocacy in American journalism, running from Thomas Paine through Edward R. Murrow. For those with little patience for the numbing rituals of the modern press conference, Ramos’s insistence on making unwelcome points had been refreshing, and it was Trump’s heavy-handed response that was worrisome. Certainly, the questions raised by Ramos had been unusually serious and substantial at a press event otherwise dominated by talk of poll numbers, campaign operatives, and personal spats.","3784","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos’s problem with authority began, in Mexico, with priests. The Benedictine fathers who taught him at school, he said, were reactionary sadists. “They hit us with shoes. They were pulling us from the hair,” he told me, demonstrating with a twisting temple-area hair grab. He is anticlerical to this day. His father, an architect, was rigid and unyielding, and wanted Jorge, his oldest son, to become an architect, a lawyer, a doctor, or an engineer. “It was the same in the country as a whole, with each President imposed by his predecessor, not elected,” Ramos said. “I felt like I had three huge authority figures imposing their rules on me from the time I was a child.” Ramos defied his father and majored in communications in college, working at a travel agency and a radio station. He got interested in journalism and, after graduation, switched to television, becoming a news writer and then an on-air reporter. His employer was Televisa, Mexico’s largest media conglomerate. Once, for a story about Mexican political psychology, Ramos interviewed people critical of the government. But Televisa was slavishly loyal to the Mexican government, and, Ramos said, “My boss was horrified. He told me, ‘No son de la casa’”—they are not our people. “He completely changed my story, and I resigned in protest. I wish I still had the letter I wrote.”","3785","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"We were eating sushi in a crowded little Venezuelan restaurant in Doral, Florida, near Miami’s airport and Univision’s news studios. “Ask any immigrant about arriving here,” Ramos said, waving his chopsticks. “They can tell you the exact date, time, circumstances, everything they first noticed.” He arrived in 1983, shortly after quitting Televisa. He had sold his first car, a VW Beetle, to buy a plane ticket to Los Angeles. “I still have the guitar I carried through the airport. I was twenty-four, almost completely broke, with everything I owned in one bag. I had a student visa, and I remember thinking, This is freedom. You can carry everything you own.” He studied television and journalism in an extension course at U.C.L.A., working part time as a waiter and at a movie house. Then he got his first job in American journalism, as a reporter at KMEX, a Spanish-language TV station that operated out of an old house on Melrose Avenue. “We did three stories a day from the street. It was the best possible training. I did hundreds of stories there.”","3786","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"KMEX was also Ramos’s introduction to the community role that the Spanish-language media fills, and is expected to fill, in the United States. The station sponsored health fairs and job fairs, and broadcast English lessons. People called the station to ask which school to send their children to, which doctor to go to. “That TV is your window into the new world you’re in, where you don’t have many friends,” a Cuban-American media consultant in Coral Gables told me. “Those stations are more than information sources. They’re certainly more than businesses. The on-air personalities become like old friends. If you get ripped off, you don’t call the cops, you call Univision or Telemundo. They have these watchdog shows—here in Miami, it’s ‘El 23 a Tu Lado’ [‘23 on Your Side’]. That’s activist journalism.”","3787","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"KMEX was owned by the Spanish International Network, which later became Univision. In 1985, Ramos began hosting a morning show, in addition to his reporting, and a company executive, visiting Los Angeles, happened to see it. “Rosita Peru,” Ramos recalled. “She invited me to come to Miami to start a national morning show. I said, ‘Sure.’ I moved, and I did that show for eleven months. It was so difficult. There was no script. It was a lot of improvising on-air. Two hours a day. I wanted to be doing news. But I never even saw the people in the news operations. They would just be coming to work as I was crawling out the door.”","3788","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Univision had a Mexican flavor—it had been launched as a subsidiary of Televisa, and the bulk of its programming was, and still is, telenovelas made by Televisa. About a year after Ramos got to Miami, Televisa’s owner, Emilio Azcárraga Milmo, a formidable monopolist known as El Tigre, made a move on Univision’s news department. The plan was to install Jacobo Zabludovsky, Televisa’s main news anchor, as the director of Univision’s news operations. Zabludovsky, a reedy government mouthpiece with rectangular eyeglasses, was one of the most famous men in Mexico, although he is now remembered for having opened a newscast in October, 1968, after the police and the military had massacred scores of protesting students in the plaza at Tlatelolco, in Mexico City, by intoning, “Today was a sunny day.”","3789","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Zabludovsky came to Miami, arriving at Univision’s modest studios in a black limousine. His meeting with the news department did not go well. There was a newsroom revolt. Besides the prospect of a journalistic calamity—the imposition of Mexican-style censorship—there was, according to Ramos, the Cuba-Mexico problem. Mexico recognized Fidel Castro’s regime—indeed, the two countries enjoyed warm relations—which made the Mexican government anathema to many of South Florida’s Cuban exiles. The Miami Herald sharply questioned the Televisa takeover of Univision’s news department. To make matters worse, Zabludovsky had accompanied Castro on his march into Havana during the revolution, providing enthusiastic coverage. The misbegotten plan to install Zabludovsky was finally scuttled when most of the Univision news department simply quit. El Tigre was soon forced by federal authorities to sell his stake in Univision under a law forbidding foreign ownership of broadcast stations.","3790","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The skeleton crew that remained at Univision needed, among other things, a nightly-news anchor. “So they went and found the only on-air male still on the premises,” Ramos recalled. That was the skinny kid on the morning show, the güerito. “I didn’t even know how to read a teleprompter, which in those days was just a roll of paper that constantly jammed.” He got help from an experienced co-anchor, Teresa Rodriguez. “Teresa saved me. She had blood-red fingernails and she used to run her nail down the backup script on our desk, to help me keep my place.” Rodriguez went on maternity leave—she now co-hosts a Sunday-evening news-magazine show, “Aquí y Ahora” (“Here and Now”)—and Ramos ended up co-anchoring with María Elena Salinas, a dynamic newscaster from L.A. whom Ramos had first met at KMEX. The two of them clicked. Twenty-seven years later, they are still working side by side, and are the best-known newspeople, perhaps the best-known faces, among the fifty-five million Latinos now in the United States.","3791","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Salinas has also won a slew of journalism awards, including, in 2012, an Emmy for lifetime achievement and, earlier this year, a Peabody for a special on the exodus of Central American children to the United States.","3792","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Miami was quite different when he first arrived, Ramos said. “It wasn’t always easy to be Mexican here. Cubans ran the place. They understood how the system worked. They had the Cold War policy that said that any Cuban who made it to the U.S. was automatically legal. There were no undocumented Cubans. Local mass media focussed on Fidel, and people were suspicious of any other point of view. I had trouble just because I was Mexican. But then the city began to change, to diversify, first with Central American immigrants fleeing the civil wars there. Next came the Colombians, getting away from the cocaine wars. Then came the Venezuelans, running from Hugo Chávez.”","3793","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"As a Univision co-anchor, Ramos found that he had the media weight to arrange interviews with heads of state, particularly in Latin America. It was also part of his mandate. His viewers were hungry for news from their home countries. Ramos wanted an interview with Castro, but Castro granted very few, and those were given to sympathetic journalists. So Ramos contrived to encounter him outside a hotel in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he was attending an Ibero-American summit, in 1991. With his camera rolling, Ramos, calling Castro “Comandante,” asked him if Marxism was not a museum piece. Castro slowed and put his arm around Ramos’s shoulders and said he didn’t think so. Marxism was young, while capitalism was three thousand years old. Ramos eluded Castro’s arm, acutely aware that it compromised him as a reporter and that the Cubans in Miami would never forgive him if he let it stay there—something Castro himself probably knew quite well, Ramos thought. Castro’s bodyguards moved in. Ramos quickly asked another question, about the fall of the Berlin Wall. Castro countered with a reference to the modest wall then being built by the United States along the Mexican border, and put his hand on Ramos’s shoulder. Ramos then pointed out that many people believed that it was time for Castro to hold a plebiscito in Cuba—a referendum on his rule. Castro responded politely, but Ramos had gone too far. Castro’s bodyguards edged him out of the way. Ramos lost his balance and fell down. Castro kept walking, saying nothing, and didn’t look back. The interview had lasted a minute and three seconds.","3794","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Univision now covers Cuba as a matter of course. Ramos never did get a formal interview with Fidel, but in 1998 he went to Cuba to cover the visit of Pope John Paul II. He tried to convey the country’s complexity in his dispatches, but he ignored the advice of government minders not to give too much attention to dissidents, and he has been blackballed ever since.","3795","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"María Elena Salinas told me that, in his interviews with Latin-American leaders, Ramos used to routinely ask, “Is Fidel a dictator?” She laughed. “People would say, ‘Why are you always asking the same question?’ It was because he wanted these heads of state on the record.” His other standard question with Presidents, she said, is “How much money do you have?” “He likes to ask it when they first come into office, and then a second time, a few years later, if they agree to talk again, to see how much they’ve been stealing.”","3796","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos’s questions often infuriate his interviewees. In Bogotá, in 1996, he demanded that the Colombian President, Ernesto Samper, explicitly state whether or not his election campaign had accepted drug money, and showed Samper a photograph in which he appeared with two alleged narco-traffickers. Samper was annoyed. Ramos and his crew had already received death threats after a prior interview with Samper, and they fled the country on the first available flight. Ramos calls Miami mi trinchera—his foxhole, into which he can jump when there is trouble. As a child of Mexico, he says, he never takes for granted the protections he enjoys as an American. (He became a citizen in 2008.)","3797","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"In a 1994 interview with Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the deeply feared Mexican President, Ramos asked Salinas if he had gained office by fraud, as many Mexicans believed. Ramos pressed him on regional vote totals that were mathematically impossible. He questioned Salinas closely about the murder, a few months earlier, of his anointed successor, Luis Donaldo Colosio. (Salinas moved to Ireland after his term ended, amid persistent reports that he did so to avoid murder charges in the Colosio case.) “It was unbelievable that I could sit there and confront him with the evidence of fraud,” Ramos told me, “and then ask him about the dedazo”—“the big finger,” with which Mexican Presidents traditionally chose their successors. “In those days, and in the country where I grew up, no Mexican journalist could even speak that word, dedazo, in an interview with the President and still have a job when he got home.”","3798","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"One of Ramos’s models is Oriana Fallaci, the fiery Italian journalist. “I read her book ‘Interview with History’ in college,” he said. “I loved how she took on the Shah, Qaddafi, Kissinger. She saw the interview as a little war, with a winner. For certain interviews, I see it the same way. My only weapon is the question. And, living here, it’s not risky. I can make powerful people angry, and show our audience what they really are, and then go home and live a normal life.”","3799","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Home is in Coral Gables, where Ramos lives with his girlfriend, Chiquinquirá Delgado, a Venezuelan actress, who co-hosts a Univision reality show called “Nuestra Belleza Latina” (“Our Latin Beauty”). He has two children from two marriages, and his younger child, Nicolas, a high-school junior, still lives with him. Delgado’s five-year-old daughter rounds out the household.","3800","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"In the sushi place, our waiter, a tall young Venezuelan, told Ramos that he had decided to apply for U.S. citizenship. Ramos congratulated him. “I realized I have to do it,” the young man said. “If we can’t vote, then we have no way to fight back against people like Trump.”","3801","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos can’t get over the fact that the most trusted voices in mainstream TV news, as far as he’s concerned, are comedians: Jon Stewart, John Oliver, Stephen Colbert. Ramos and Oliver have joked together on-air about being immigrants, defeated by telephone voice-recognition systems that force them to adopt American accents to make themselves understood. Stewart accused Ramos of stealing his material when Ramos got big laughs on “The Daily Show” with lines about the Latino demographic boom. When Ramos urged Colbert, on “The Colbert Report,” to consider “co-responsibility” for undocumented immigration, since, as he said, “They’re here because we are hiring them, and we benefit from their work,” Colbert paused, seemed to go almost out of character, and finally said, “I don’t have a comeback for that, so we’re probably going to edit it out of the interview.” Ramos thinks that the best political comedians, with their fake news and stone-faced parody, are trusted because they offer, at bottom, “transparency” about their own views, rather than simply a straight news report that viewers have come to know is often riddled with false equivalencies in pursuit of “balance.” (“Others, however, insist the earth is flat.”)","3802","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos does not have a trust problem with his audience. Freddy Balsera, a media analyst and political consultant specializing in Latino affairs, told me, “We do polls. We ask, ‘Who is the most influential Hispanic in the U.S.?’ Over and over, Jorge comes out No. 1.” Sonia Sotomayor, the Supreme Court Justice, comes in first in other polls. Among institutions, Univision comes in second on the trust meter with Latinos, behind the Catholic Church.","3803","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"“People grew up with Jorge,” Gabriela Tristán, a Univision executive producer, told me. “You watched him with your parents, your grandparents. Him and María Elena. Whatever they say, it’s the law.”","3804","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Balsera thought that Ramos’s run-in with Donald Trump in Iowa had enhanced his standing among Latinos. “But why doesn’t Marco Rubio challenge Trump?” he said. “Or Ted Cruz? Why does Jorge Ramos have to defend our culture, our community?”","3805","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Some Latino conservatives disapproved of Ramos’s dustup. Ruben Navarrette, Jr., a syndicated columnist, accused him of being “unprofessional” and “playing into every negative stereotype that Americans subscribe to about Mexicans.” Then, there are the mainstream dismissals of Ramos as a lightweight, a niche performer, a “heckler.” Ramos appeared on “The O’Reilly Factor” shortly after the event in Iowa, and the segment began with Bill O’Reilly asking, “Anchorman or activist?” O’Reilly urged Ramos to stop calling himself a reporter. Ramos replied, “I don’t think you’re the right person to lecture me on advocacy and journalism.” He went on to draw a distinction between being partisan and being independent. O’Reilly is effectively a Republican Party partisan, he argued.","3806","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Alfonso Aguilar, who used to have a radio show on Univision, where he considered himself a “token conservative,” deplores the liberal bias of Univision, and thinks that “Spanish-language media is not being held to the same standards as mainstream media” when it comes to distinguishing between reporting and opinion. Ramos and María Elena Salinas are both at fault, according to Aguilar, “because you’re manipulating audiences if you don’t clarify.” Aguilar, who worked for the George W. Bush Administration and is now the executive director of the American Principles Project’s Latino Partnership, in Washington, D.C., still appears on Univision programs, including “Al Punto,” but he says that Univision correspondents in bureaus across the country complain to him, privately, that they get a bad rap because of editorializing by anchors in Miami.","3807","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos has had combative interviews with President Obama. During the 2008 campaign, he extracted a promise from Obama that an immigration-reform bill would be pushed forward during his first year in the White House. In a 2012 interview, Ramos, although appearing live on Univision, switched to English and said, “It was a promise, Mr. President. . . . I don’t want it to get lost in translation. . . . A promise is a promise. And, with all due respect, you didn’t keep that promise.” Obama looked miserable; Ramos hasn’t been markedly easier on him in more recent interviews. Last December, Ramos reminded the President that he had become known among Latinos as “the Deporter-in-Chief.” Yet Obama, along with every other national politician with an interest in reaching Latino voters, knows that Ramos and Salinas are the gateway. Randy Falco, the president and chief executive of Univision, is a Republican. He told me that, during the 2012 general election, he pleaded with Mitt Romney to appear on the network, and that Romney obliged him only once. That appearance did not go well, and Romney did not come back. But he later told Falco that staying away was a mistake: had he made more appearances on Univision, he might conceivably have improved his disastrous Election Day showing among Latinos.","3808","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos’s daughter, Paola, who recently earned a degree from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, has a job on the Hillary Clinton campaign. She previously worked in the Obama White House, and for Jill Biden. Ramos insists that his daughter’s employment does not influence his work. His Republican critics don’t buy it. He did not disclose her work for the Obama Administration to his audience. He did disclose her position with the Clinton campaign. He may have to recuse himself from any Univision-sponsored campaign debates that include Hillary Clinton.","3809","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Univision, though obscure to most non-Spanish speakers, plays in the big leagues. In 2013 and 2014, for what are known as the July prime-time sweeps, its audience was larger than that of each of the four main English-language networks. Its original programming is sold throughout the Spanish-speaking world. (The U.S. now has more Spanish speakers than Spain does.) Its local stations in New York and Los Angeles are consistently near the top of the ratings in those cities. On the news side, the network is far more cosmopolitan than its English-language counterparts, starting with its employees. Patsy Loris, the senior news director, is Chilean; Sabrina Zambrano-Orr, the executive producer of “Al Punto,” is Venezuelan; Teresa Rodriguez is Cuban; Isaac Lee, the president for news and digital, is Colombian; and so on. The coverage of international news, especially in Latin America, is decidedly more thorough and energetic than what the English-language broadcast networks provide.","3810","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Fusion, which launched in October, 2013, has hired away a number of executives and journalists from the networks in New York, including Keith Summa, a longtime producer at ABC News, who, more recently, headed the investigative unit at CBS News. In the Univision newsroom, Summa told me, “It’s not uncommon for me to ask, ‘Who’s that guy?,’ and then to be told, ‘Oh, he had to flee X country.’ These folks come from a culture where journalism is a contact sport. Here we worry that we’re going to get sued, not shot.” Describing the contrast with his old workplaces, Summa said, “People would come in to us at ABC with these minute-by-minute ratings, saying, ‘Oh, when the overweight person comes in, the dial goes down, and when the good-looking person is on it’s up.’ Is this really how we’re supposed to do journalism? Also, the left-right thing that dominates mainstream political reporting isn’t that relevant here. At Univision, it’s more north-south. I find that refreshing. And, of course, Jorge just calls it as he sees it. He says, ‘When you’ve got the facts, you don’t need to balance with non-facts.’ There’s a groupthink in the Bermuda Triangle of the three big networks, but Jorge doesn’t go to those cocktail parties.”","3811","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Isaac Lee, who is also the chief executive of Fusion, asked me if I knew who Ramos’s agent and lawyer were. I didn’t. “It’s him,” he said. “Jorge. We negotiate his contracts right at this table. It takes fifteen minutes.”","3812","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"When Fusion launched, Ramos was nervous about working in English. At first, he had a nightly news show, which began an hour after his Univision newscast ended. With his Sunday-morning show and his other gigs, the workload was unmanageable—he had so much script to write, and spent so many hours on set, that he could barely leave the studio to report stories. He soon cut back to the weekly show, “America with Jorge Ramos.” Fusion’s target audience was initially meant to be young, English-dominant Latinos, but such viewers didn’t want or need their own network, and the target demographic was expanded to Millennials (ages eighteen to thirty-four) of any ethnicity. The Fusion cable channel offers a mixture of news and entertainment, with heavy emphases on pop culture, the drug war, sex, and viral videos—and a small number of programs in heavy rotation. Fusion’s Web site, which launched in February, has a greater range and number of offerings, but will not soon be worrying competitors like Gawker and BuzzFeed. The digital content is available on many platforms—Instagram, Snapchat, Vine, Apple TV—and the company recently hired Alexis Madrigal away from The Atlantic’s Web site to be its editor-in-chief. Fusion TV is available in forty million homes, but is not carried by Comcast or Time Warner, and it does not subscribe to the Nielsen ratings service, which is probably for the best. The company lost thirty-five million dollars in 2014, its first full year in business.","3813","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"“America with Jorge Ramos” stands out from everything else on Fusion, partly because its host is decades older than anyone else at the network, but mainly because of its quality. Ramos has done specials from Israel and the West Bank (about young people and the wall there), and from Puerto Rico. He is always looking for new ways to address the immigration story. The style of his dispatches, and those of the young correspondents on “America,” is decidedly more handheld and helter-skelter, in the general vein of Vice News, than his work for Univision. In one stunt for Fusion, Ramos swam the Rio Grande, at a not-narrow point, fully clothed, gasping for air while trying to narrate. Still, the journalistic standard remains high, from what I’ve seen, and Ramos considers it a big step that clips of his work are immediately available, without translation, to the large number of Americans (and the media élites) who don’t speak Spanish. “It’s like we were just talking to ourselves before, to fellow-Latinos, in a parallel world,” he said. “This is a breakthrough.” With technical help from digital producers, he has thrown himself into social media, generating a steady stream of tweets and Facebook posts, including popular videos (millions of views) that he writes and shoots with a single camera in newsroom hallways when inspiration strikes.","3814","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"In May, Ann Coulter appeared on Ramos’s Fusion show. They taped the interview in front of a live audience, and Coulter’s eagerness to give offense was breathtaking. At one point, she said, “I have a little tip. If you don’t want to be killed by ISIS, don’t go to Syria. If you don’t want to be killed by a Mexican, there’s nothing I can tell you.” Ramos likes to say that silence is death on TV, but at that moment he said nothing. The audience, too, seemed shocked into silence. After a long, awkward pause, Coulter went on, “Very easy to avoid being killed by ISIS. Don’t fly to Syria.” Ramos finally asked, “Are you really saying . . . ? We’re talking about forty million immigrants in this country.” Coulter, arguing for an end to immigration, talked about how certain “cultures” from which large numbers of people immigrate to the U.S. “are obviously deficient,” making cryptic reference to “uncles raping their nieces.” It was, in its way, good TV.","3815","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos looks forward to the Latinization of the United States. “We were fifteen million when I got here,” he said. “Now we’re fifty-five million. By 2050, we’ll be more than a hundred million.” Converting those numbers to real political power is slow going. Univision and its smaller rival, Telemundo, along with many other organizations, sponsor voter-registration drives, but Latinos still punch well below their demographic weight in registration and voter turnout. Ramos is an evangelist for Latino political power. “Our turn is coming,” he told me. “And the attitude is changing, especially since Barack Obama was elected. I go out on publicity tours for my books, and, you know Latinos, they bring everybody in the family to everything, even little kids. So I always ask the kids, ‘Who wants to be the first Latino President?’ It used to be no hands went up, or maybe one or two. Now, with Obama, many of the little hands go up. It will happen in my lifetime. I hope to be able to cover the Inauguration. I don’t care if it’s a Republican or a Democrat. It could even be Rubio or Cruz.” Both have been on his show.","3816","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos, and Latino voters generally, appreciated the effort that George W. Bush made to reach them, particularly his support for immigration reform, even though it proved fruitless. Bush received forty per cent of the Latino vote in 2004. Ramos strongly endorses the conventional wisdom that no party can now win the White House with less than a third of the Latino vote. There is, however, a counterargument. California and Texas, the big states with the largest Latino populations, will not be in play in next year’s election, and most of the likely swing states have few Latino voters. The exceptions are Florida, Colorado, and Nevada, which have forty-four electoral votes combined. Florida, where Cubans and Puerto Ricans greatly outnumber Mexicans, is a special case, and not all electoral-vote strategists agree that Latinos will be a decisive factor in Colorado or Nevada.","3817","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Still, Ramos and his Univision colleagues find that national politicians are finally starting to come to them. Patsy Loris, who has been producing Ramos’s programs since the nineteen-eighties, told me, “It was always difficult. Every time we would ask for a sound bite in Spanish, we would get the assistant to the assistant to the assistant.” Ramos was sometimes able to get big interviews, but only in election years. “That’s changing now, thank God,” Loris said. “I think Jorge going on Fusion helps. But people who are just discovering him, they don’t realize, he’s always been exactly like this. He was never traditional. That was why he left Mexico.”","3818","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Loris’s office is along one wall of an enormous newsroom that Univision shares with Fusion and the local station, WLTV. Ramos was three doors down, banging out introductions for segments on “Al Punto,” which was taping that afternoon. María Elena Salinas was on the far side of Ramos. Along the other walls were control rooms, editing suites, and three TV studios; the rest of the open-plan floor was filled with desks where hundreds of people worked. Each desk had at least two large monitors, and nearly every chair was draped with a shawl, a sweater, a sweatshirt, or a coat—somehow, on a ninety-five-degree day, the vast space, two stories high and a hundred and fifty thousand square feet, was kept meat-locker cold. A dozen news channels were being projected on the walls.","3819","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"I camped out in Ramos’s office while he finished writing intros. There was no clutter. A little corkboard in the corner of his desk with tacked-up photographs of his kids and girlfriend. A vertical book stand in the opposite corner. A computer, before which he rolled his shoulders and clicked away. That was it. The only thing on the walls was a glass board on which a few dates and names were scribbled: “O’Reilly,” “Arpaio,” “Bill Maher,” “DC/Papa.” Those were upcoming gigs or stories. Ramos wears no jewelry, not even a watch or a ring—an uncommon presentation for a man in Miami. He keeps his hair short. He dresses simply, in jeans and an oxford shirt, tries to travel with only a carry-on bag, and hates wearing a suit—though he dons one every night for the newscast. He even somehow maintains an empty e-mail in-box. Salinas and I had been comparing overstuffed in-boxes. We both had thousands of unopened messages. Ramitos, as she calls him, had zero. Each time I e-mailed him, he answered quickly. It was unnatural.","3820","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Salinas said that, in twenty-seven years of working together, often under ferocious deadlines, she had never heard Ramos shout. “Things bother him, but he doesn’t yell and get mad,” she said. “I’ve never known anybody as disciplined as he is. Jorge can multitask like a woman. Very few men can do that. He’s flexible—he knows how to pick his battles—but he’s also incredibly stubborn.” She shook her head. “We know each other so well, we can read each other’s mind. On the air, we never interrupt each other. We know that if one of us is incapacitated—choking, forgetting something—the other will pick up.”","3821","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"TV news is live performance—part journalism and part theatre. The line between journalism and entertainment is blurred in other reporting genres, but TV is the closest to pure show business. In a cynical view, news is just another entertainment product among the many that Univision sells, and Jorge Ramos is a character, a “brand,” who brings profits to the corporation. Exposing corruption, confronting bigots, championing immigrants—these performances are hugely popular. “They help to protect an enormous market,” Tomás López-Pumarejo, a professor at Brooklyn College, points out. And the topic of immigration is a proven ratings winner on Univision.","3822","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"I have never heard Ramos say a cynical word. His zeal and outrage seem deeply felt, genuine. But I did notice, after the Trump press conference in Iowa, as Ramos was leaving the convention center, that he briefly crossed paths with Ann Coulter, who was preparing to introduce Trump at the rally. She seemed surprised to see Ramos, but unfazed. Not a word was said. They were two troupers, old pros, busy plowing their respective rows. They swerved toward each other and exchanged a quick fist bump in passing.","3823","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Later, I watched Ramos pacing on a levee above the Mississippi River in the twilight, talking on his cell phone, pondering his next move. Because of the Trump confrontation, he had already shot to the top of global “trending topics” on Twitter. He knew, as a newsman, that he shouldn’t step on the story. Interview requests were pouring in; he was turning down nearly all of them. He had already done a short, straightforward standup outside the convention center—in English for Fusion, in Spanish for Univision. He decided to talk the next morning, before dawn, Iowa time, to George Stephanopoulos, on “Good Morning America.” Since ABC is a co-owner of Fusion, a corporate obligation accrued there. Then, he thought, he would do Megyn Kelly’s show on Fox News. She, too, had been ill used by Trump. Other than that, he should probably let the story run on its own steam. Were these the calculations of a celebrity, a performer, or a journalist? Did those distinctions matter at that moment?","3824","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Ramos finished writing his intros, sent them to a teleprompter file, did a phone interview with a Venezuelan radio station, and announced that he was ready to leave. We took his car to a Thai place in Doral for takeout. The Univision news studios are in a light-industrial park—a huge gray featureless box among long, pastel-façaded warehouses with uninformative names slapped over doors and truck bays: Avcom Technik, Nutritional Power Center, Trans-Air Systems, Inc. “That guy I was talking to in Venezuela, Nelson Bocaranda, is amazing,” Ramos said. “A great reporter. He always has sources. He even had a source among Chávez’s doctors.” That was a hard-news reporter talking. “But all the traditional media spaces are closed there now, so they’re using the Internet to do independent journalism. It’s incredibly courageous.”","3825","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The Thai place was in a strip mall. Ramos greeted people at nearly every table, all in Spanish. “Miami has been incredibly generous to Latinos,” he told me. “As one of my first bosses here told me, ‘It’s the only city in America where we’re not treated as second-class citizens.’ ”","3826","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Over lunch, I asked Ramos to name the most edifying story he has covered. “Probably the Mexican election in 2000,” he said. “I thought I was going to die with the PRI still in power.” The Institutional Revolutionary Party ruled Mexico for seventy-one years, ending in 2000. “On Election Day, we started playing soccer in the Zócalo, the Univision crew, as a way of celebrating. We were surrounded by soldiers and cops. This was precisely the regime I had been running from. All the efforts of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans had paid off.” Unfortunately, the Mexican governments since 2000 have proved a terrible disappointment. The PRI is back in power now, and Ramos has been hammering the leadership for its corruption and incompetence. Meanwhile, he says, Mexican journalists who have exposed corruption have been rewarded by being fired, if not far worse.","3827","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Back at the studio, we ran into Chiquinquirá Delgado. She was about to go on the air, and was wearing high heels that caused her to tower over Ramos. Delgado became a celebrity as a teen-ager, when she was first runner-up in the 1990 Miss Venezuela pageant; she went on to become a model and then a soap-opera star. I asked if her life in Venezuela had required bodyguards. It had, she said. Her life here was far more relaxed. She and Ramos rode bicycles, went to the supermarket. Then it was showtime; she smiled apologetically and hurried off. Seeing Delgado with Ramos on the set—probably the best-looking couple in Florida, if not North America—reignited my print hack’s distrust of TV stardom. Later, watching him on a Fusion set, waiting for the cameras to roll, I was struck by how physically different from the rest of us he seemed. The crew scurried around, lugging heavy equipment, muttering under headsets. We were all in shadow. The lights found Ramos’s calm, chiselled features, his clear gray eyes gazing into the middle distance. Then the technical director, a young African-American woman in a scruffy T-shirt and a backward ball cap, said, “O.K., we’re ready. Jorge, please sit down.”","3828","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"

"The sheer quantity of multitasking—there is no other word for it—in Ramos’s workday is phenomenal. He is taping, writing, interviewing, making his arguments about the lineup and the order of the evening’s segments in the big three-o’clock news meeting, or going live, non-stop, back to back. That morning, he said, he had written a column about air-conditioning and climate change—the perversity of the status conferred by rendering buildings ice cold in hot places like Miami and Puerto Rico. The column, distributed by the New York Times Syndicate, would appear in more than thirty papers in the U.S. and Latin America. “But not till next week,” Ramos said, “when this Trump news cycle will have turned.”","3830","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"And now the Pope was coming to America. This Pope’s first language is Spanish. Might he score an interview?","3831","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Not a chance, Ramos said. He wished. But he had burned his bridges at the Vatican with a brutal 2013 interview of a powerful Mexican cardinal. “I was asking him about how the Church protected monsters like Marcial Maciel for so many years and we argued on-air.” Maciel was a Mexican priest who, among other depredations, sexually abused schoolboys in Italy and Spain, and was personally close to Pope John Paul II. I watched the interview, and the persistence of Ramos and the utter, teeth-gnashing rage of the cardinal were riveting. “I wasn’t able to confront those priests in school,” Ramos said. “But I can do it now.” He had definitely made himself a pariah at the Vatican, though, for years to come.","3832","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The lead story on that evening’s newscast was the resignation of Guatemala’s President, Otto Pérez Molina. Univision had a team on the ground, and they gave the event full, in-depth treatment. No other U.S. network would come close to the quality of this coverage. I watched Ramos and Salinas trade parts, sitting for some segments, standing in front of a wall lit with graphics for others. When they weren’t on the air, they clattered away on laptops, or studied monitors set beneath their desks, which showed what the competition was doing. There were moments of byplay between them. But off-camera, in repose, they were very different. Salinas, with her strong features and dramatic dark eyes, is leonine. She looks as if she could take down a wildebeest with a single bite. Ramos, beside her, seems almost meek, recessive. He folds his arms, cocks his head, and looks offstage, lost in thought, his motor barely idling. Then comes a director’s countdown, and he drops his arms, clasps his hands in front of him, leans forward, and seems to grow, addressing the camera, still relaxed but at the same time intense and commanding.","3833","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Another story for tonight: Donald Trump has just scolded Jeb Bush for speaking Spanish—to wit, “I like Jeb. He’s a nice man. But he should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States.” Salinas will report this item straight, near the end of the show, and Univision researchers have thrown together, on very short notice, a remarkable segment of Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, and Marco Rubio all speaking Spanish, some more fluently than others. Bill Clinton says, in English, “I hope I’ll be the last non-Spanish-speaking President.”","3834","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"The Trump news cycle will not be over soon. He has encouraged the worst instincts in white America to emerge and flail and flex. In Alabama, one of his supporters told the Times that he hoped President Trump would “make the border a vacation spot. It’s going to cost you twenty-five dollars for a permit, and then you get fifty dollars for every confirmed kill.” When did it become acceptable in America to talk about other human beings that way at a mainstream political rally? The silver lining of this nightmare is that Latinos are now more likely to organize, politically, in fear and anger, and to make their power felt more strongly at the polls in 2016.","3835","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"Toward the end of that evening’s newscast, I left the set and crossed the newsroom to a control room. I like the buzz of the dark, busy cockpit, all the producers and technicians intent on screens and consoles, the countdowns, the collective waves of emotion—nervousness and relief—as switches are thrown, segments successfully delivered, commercials correctly inserted. At Univision, the three official languages—Spanish, English, and Spanglish—fly around in quick, gaudy combinations. When a correspondent starts tripping over her words, a hush descends, and, when she finally makes it out of the sentence, there’s a general sigh. “Yeah, what she said.” But tonight, before I get to the door, I catch a segment up on a wall screen about that day’s ugliness. The story seems to be from North Carolina. There are posters, painted by children. The posters say “Go Home” and “America Is for Americans” and “If We Don’t Take Out the Trash, Who Will?” Nobody in the newsroom seems to be reacting to the story. Everybody has work to do. But I find myself too ashamed to open the control-room door. ♦","3836","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/05/the-man-who-wouldnt-sit-down"
"In early 2013, the R.N.C., under its current chairman, Reince Priebus, produced a searching report that tried to make sense of Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat. When the report was released, the biggest news was its frank dissection of the G.O.P.’s weakness among groups that voted overwhelmingly for Obama. “Public perception of the Party is at record lows,” the document noted. “Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the Party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country.”","November 2, 2015","3837","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But, beyond the demographic warnings contained in the report, Priebus’s team also cautioned that the Republican Party was living in a cocoon. The report said that the G.O.P. was “increasingly marginalizing itself” at the federal level. “The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself,” the report said. “We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.”","3838","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"One of the report’s less-well-known recommendations had to do with primary debates. The number of G.O.P. Presidential primary debates had grown from six in 1980 to twenty in 2012. Republicans wanted to gain some control over the process in 2016. “The number of debates has become ridiculous, and they’re taking candidates away from other important campaign activities,” the report noted. The report recommended that the G.O.P. sanction no more than ten to twelve debates, a recommendation that Priebus later implemented.","3839","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But there was another recommendation that wasn’t adopted. Buried in the report was this idea:","3840","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Ultimately, the R.N.C. decided against setting up its own organization to run its debates. Instead, it stuck with the model of partnering with media organizations to conduct them, partly because of the high costs of running its own debates and partly because the R.N.C. worried that setting up its own debates might make the events less credible.","3841","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"All of this was decided long before any of the candidates announced their campaigns for President. (The Republican debate schedule was released in January, 2014.) The candidates were essentially stuck with the agreements that the R.N.C. had already negotiated with the various media outlets.","3842","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Last week, after the CNBC debate that most of the candidates complained was unfair and featured hostile moderators, the campaigns finally revolted against the Priebus-negotiated debates. Representatives from most of the Republican Presidential campaigns met near Washington on Sunday night to wrest control from Priebus and the R.N.C. Today, they released a draft letter with their demands—which essentially consist of having their cake and eating it, too. The campaigns that sign the letter want the media to host and televise the events, but they want a level of control that they would get from running them and paying for them themselves. (Donald Trump is reportedly going to negotiate on his own.) The section of the letter that immediately caught the attention of many in the media was the following:","3843","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Most people would agree that the Republican (and Democratic) Parties should have some say in how the debates are run and organized. These are, after all, not just news events or typical media interviews. They are partnerships between the media and a political party. It’s fair that the mechanics of the debate, such as the format, length of time, rules, and the moderators, should all be up for negotiation. For instance, the R.N.C. asked its mainstream-media partners to add a conservative media outlet to the events, to insure that the questioning would reflect some of the issues important to Republican primary voters.","3844","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"But surely the red line for any media organization has to be editorial content. After all, the R.N.C. rejected the option of running these debates on its own. It is the media that is paying for the events, and it is over the media’s airwaves that the events are broadcast.","3845","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"Of course, if the candidates don’t get their way, they don’t have to attend the debates. They could, as they have threatened to do, boycott future R.N.C.-sanctioned events, just as Donald Trump threatened to boycott the CNBC debate. (There’s a precedent for this. In 2007, the Democrats cancelled a Fox News debate, though in that case Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did not demand to control any elements of Fox News’s editorial content as a precondition for participating in the event.)","3846","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"What the candidates shouldn’t be allowed to do is tell reporters what questions to ask or what graphics to show on the screen, or have any role whatsoever in the editorial judgments of a news organization. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan’s famous quip, if the G.O.P. wants that much control, then it needs to pay for the microphone.","3847","http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-g-o-p-s-outlandish-debate-proposal"
"In the prologue to “The Snow Queen” (the source for Disney’s “Frozen”), Hans Christian Andersen describes “an evil troll”—the devil—who fashioned a mirror with unusual qualities: “It would shrink everything that was good and beautiful to almost nothing and it would magnify whatever was worthless and ugly and make it seem even worse”; its effect on ordinary people was to make “their faces so twisted you couldn’t tell who they were.”","September 2, 2015","3848","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"Andersen’s ingenious mirror, were it to exist, would hardly be necessary when looking at today’s Presidential candidates: the campaign, even at this early stage, has been doing the mirror’s work for it. In a rough count, there are twenty-two contenders, men and women, Republican and Democrat, each one seemingly prepared to keep going. It won’t take long for some of them to become unrecognizable—the way Mitt Romney, once the bright, moderate governor of Massachusetts, four years ago became a “severely conservative” office-seeker. To paraphrase Andersen, Romney’s outlook had become so twisted you couldn’t tell who he was.","3849","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"In contemporary campaigns, which rely so much on artifice and the huge gobs of money that manufacture more artifice, it’s often hard to figure out who these striving people are apart from who they say they are. For instance, is Mike Huckabee, the preacher and former governor of Arkansas, the generous fellow who, seven years ago, came to the defense of the Presidential candidate Barack Obama and his pastor, Jeremiah Wright? (That was when Wright said, among other politically unhelpful things, that African-Americans should not sing “God Bless America” but “God damn America.”) Or is Huckabee the inflexible, unforgiving person who now compares same-sex marriage to swearing and drinking, would allow no exceptions for abortion, and says that, by agreeing to a nuclear deal with Iran, Obama “would take the Israelis and basically march them to the door of the oven”?","3850","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"The identity-distortion has its own term of art, the “reset,” often a signal that a candidate isn’t sure what the campaign is about or why it keeps going. When the Times recently reported that Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, looking enviously at polls that favored Donald Trump, “announced a reset of his campaign,” you could only wonder how this shrill, partisan figure (Walker, not Trump) could look any less Presidential. Actually, he managed it by doing several reverse flips on the question of birthright citizenship and the Fourteenth Amendment.","3851","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"Jeb Bush hit his reset button before he formally announced his candidacy. Hillary Clinton, who keeps sinking in key polls no matter how hard she works at sounding like a national leader, has reset her tone and is likely to do so again. On the other hand, Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, who has been trying to come up with a reset strategy, may have fallen so far behind in polls that he won’t qualify for first-tier status in the next Republican debate. With every reset, voters may begin to suspect that a candidate is really saying, “If you don’t like who I am, I’ll be someone else.” If Andersen’s troll does his dirty work, that someone else will be less appealing than the original.","3852","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"The enduring example of a candidate with many resets is Richard Nixon, whose most important one came in 1956. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had suffered a major heart attack, in the fall of 1955, and with Ike’s fragile health and an absence of Republican competition, a Nixon Presidency seemed increasingly likely, later if not sooner. Political reporters began to write about a “new Nixon,” suggesting the emergence of a gentler, more thoughtful iteration of someone whose career in politics started in 1946. When Nixon ran for President against John F. Kennedy, in 1960, and CBS’s Walter Cronkite broached the subject, Nixon said, “When people say there is a new Nixon, that must mean that people who did not like the Nixon that they knew before now like the one that they know now. I happen to believe, myself, that perhaps many of those who discover the new Nixon may not have known the old one.” The new Nixon and the old Nixon turned out to be pretty much the same person, but as the Wall Street Journal’s Vermont Royster observed when Nixon ran in 1968, “Nothing seems to fascinate political journalists . . . more than new images on old faces.” Royster might have written that line today.","3853","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"The prologue to “The Snow Queen” ends with the mirror breaking into millions of pieces; then, “if a splinter got into somebody’s eye, it stayed there and made everything look bad,” at which “the devil laughed.” It would be nice if a fairy-tale mirror could explain the rise, and rise, of Donald Trump, with his talent for magnifying almost anything to the point where it is gaudy or frightening. But it would be just as helpful to look at his competitors, some of whom, like Jeb Bush, want to take things that are ugly, like his brother’s ruinous Iraq war, and make them disappear. As another Labor Day approaches, fourteen months before the nation chooses its next President, here’s a thought experiment: imagine all the candidates reflected by Andersen’s imaginary mirror and try to see who is truly staring back.","3854","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-presidential-candidates-fairy-tale-mirror"
"On the morning of October 10th, Marco Rubio, Florida’s junior senator, mounted a small stage at the Elks Lodge in Boulder City, Nevada, a popular retirement spot near Las Vegas. In his twenties, as an obscure Republican state legislator, Rubio exhibited such innate political skill that Dan Gelber, the Democratic leader of the Florida House, warned his colleagues, “When Marco Rubio speaks, young women swoon, old women faint, and toilets flush themselves.” Now that he was a Presidential candidate, Rubio was trying to speak to as many different audiences as possible. The Elks Lodge was decorated modestly, with just a few campaign banners hoisted amid the taxidermy—a demonstration of thrift intended to contrast with the front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, the billionaire Donald Trump, and to counter claims that Rubio occasionally spends more money than he should.","3855","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The attendees were predominantly older white couples, who were seeing Rubio in person for the first time. The son of Cuban immigrants, he grew up mostly in Miami, but he lived in Las Vegas from 1979 until 1985, when he left, after eighth grade. “I love coming back to southern Nevada, because it’s a place where I actually learned so much about the American Dream,” he said. “My father was a bartender at Sam’s Town”—an Old West-style casino, seven miles off the Strip. “My mother was a maid at what was then called the Imperial Palace.” He went on, “They used to have a show called ‘Legends in Concert.’ We saw that show, like, ten times. I met ‘Elvis’ and ‘Marilyn Monroe.’ You know you’re getting old when the Legends in Concert are people you used to listen to in high school.” Big laugh. Adam Hasner, a friend who served with Rubio in the Florida House, told me, “When you’re running for office in Miami-Dade County, you’re spending a lot of time in senior centers.”","3856","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At the age of forty-four, Rubio has lively dark eyes, soft cheeks, and downy brown hair affixed in a perfect part. He sometimes asks crowds to see him in the tradition of a “young President who said, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.’ ” (J.F.K. was forty-three when he entered the White House.) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, is only five months older than Rubio, but nobody calls him boyish.","3857","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"If the Democrats nominate Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the Party will be offering the oldest candidate that it has ever run in a general election, and Rubio has taken to saying, “Never in the modern history of this country has the political class in both parties been more out of touch with our country than it is right now.” But in policy terms Rubio can appear older than his years. His opposition to same-sex marriage, to raising the minimum wage, and to restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba puts him out of step with most American Latinos. In the Spanish-language media, he is sometimes described as un joven viejo—a young fogey.","3858","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After a summer submerged in a raucous primary field, Rubio had recently climbed into third place. He was ahead of Jeb Bush, his former mentor, and far behind Trump and Ben Carson. Trump’s campaign marched to the sound of a dirge—“The American Dream is dead,” he told crowds—and Rubio presented himself as a sunny alternative, a way out of Trump’s sulfurous moment. “We’re very blessed to have so many good people running for President,” he said earnestly to the crowd in Boulder City.","3859","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I had seen Rubio at half a dozen events—in Iowa, New York, Nevada—and his speeches were blemished only by a tic: he occasionally slips into a singsong cadence, turning his story into a breathy schoolboy lullaby about the “new American century.” On the whole, he is impressively consistent. Rubio in Dubuque in October was nearly indistinguishable from Rubio in Miami in April, the political equivalent of a well-managed restaurant chain: “Repeal and replace Obamacare,” scrap President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran “on Day One,” create the “most affordable business taxes in the world”—all the while heeding the populist frustrations of the moment. Vowing to remake higher education, he said, “When I’m President, before you take on student loans you’re going to know how much people make when they graduate from that school with that degree. You’re going to know that the market for philosophers has tightened over the last two thousand years.” In 2012, Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, spoke worshipfully of “job creators.” Rubio rarely mentions them. He returns, over and over, to his central task: how to make helping the poor and the middle class a Republican issue. He tells crowds, “We can no longer allow big government to be used as a tool of crony capitalism.”","3860","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But, at bottom, his campaign is only partly about policy. In a contest against a real-estate tycoon and the son and brother of former Presidents, Rubio is campaigning on the vision of a country where “the son of a bartender and a maid” can reach the White House. “It’s not just my story—it is literally our story,” he told the Boulder City crowd. “In this nation, we are all but a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the very purpose of their lives. Whether or not we remain a special country will be determined by whether or not that journey is still possible for the people trying to make it now.”","3861","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The applause was long and loud, and as Rubio climbed down from the stage to pose for selfies I asked the first couple I saw what they made of him. Cornelia Wallace, a retired nurse from the Chicago suburbs, said, “Well, I’ve got tears welled up in my eyes.” She laughed at her own reaction. “It touched my heart,” she said, and shrugged. “I get a passion from him that I don’t get from the others.”","3862","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In Las Vegas, Rubio was staying at the Bellagio. We met in a suite appointed in the Vegas Italianate style—leather, chrome, photos of fountains. When I stopped by one morning, the windows were shrouded by heavy burgundy drapes, and Rubio was worried about his voice. “I’ve been coming down with something,” he said, crossing the conference room to retrieve a bottle of water. “My throat is always feeling dry.” Doctors had told him it was an allergic reaction. “I said, ‘How come I’ve never had allergies before, and now, suddenly, the last four years I’ve developed allergies? And the answer the doctor gave me was: ‘Well, because you’re travelling to places that you never used to travel to before.’ ”","3863","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"He had made his first impression on many people outside Florida in 2013, when he gave the rebuttal to the State of the Union and leaned awkwardly offscreen to guzzle from a Poland Spring bottle—a moment that took flight on Twitter as #watergate.

"Rubio, who was spending three days in Nevada, had scheduled both public and closed-door activities. On the first night, he met with Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and donor. In April, Politico had published a story headlined “RUBIO TAKES LEAD IN SHELDON ADELSON PRIMARY,” which reported that Rubio had been calling Adelson every two weeks. I asked Rubio about it, and he said, “I don’t know about every couple of weeks, but I talk to him quite a bit.” Adelson spent about ninety-eight million dollars in connection with the 2012 campaign, including twenty million on the campaign of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He has yet to commit to a candidate in 2016. Rubio described Adelson and himself as natural allies. “The only thing Sheldon Adelson has talked to me about policy-wise is Israel,” he said. “And he doesn’t have to convince me on that, because I’m pro-Israel with or without Sheldon’s support.”","3865","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign had invited donors from around the country to join him at the Bellagio, for a football-themed retreat. The guests attended a “breakfast and team talk” and a strategy session called “Quarterbacking Victory.” One afternoon, they played flag football at a nearby sports complex, and Rubio was the quarterback on both teams. Over the years, he has developed the ability to disarm jaded donors. Bob List, the former governor of Nevada, told me about watching Rubio work a roomful of prosperous Las Vegas businessmen. At one point, Rubio was asked where his inspiration for politics originated. “He said, ‘I remember one day my father took me in the car, and we drove over to the neighborhood where Liberace’s house was.’ ” List noted, “And everybody knew where Liberace’s house was.” He went on, “He said, ‘We would drive around that neighborhood, and he’d show me where all the rich people lived, and he’d say, “Son, if you want to live like these people, you can do it.” ’ ” List shook his head and said, “He’s good-good.”","3866","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio, who has entered six elections and never lost, is alert to the appearance of overweening ambition. “All my life I’ve been in a hurry to get to my future,” he wrote in his memoir, “An American Son,” published in 2012, his second year in the Senate. In conversation, he sometimes answers so quickly that his friend Dennis Baxley, a Republican in the Florida House, once gave him a piece of advice. “I said, ‘Marco, don’t change anything you’re saying, but just wait, like, three seconds before you say it, and you’ll look so pensive.’ ” When things go wrong, Rubio’s impatience can suggest a man climbing too fast for his own good. In Washington foreign-policy circles, people remember a moment at the Brookings Institution, in April, 2012, when Rubio was delivering a major foreign-policy speech. Reaching the final page, he discovered that it had been removed accidentally from the lectern. Some politicians might have improvised; Rubio stopped awkwardly, in mid-sentence, and asked for the page to be returned.","3867","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Republican strategists, the loss of the 2012 Presidential election contained signals that spoke to the Party’s future. Latinos are the largest minority group in America, but in 2012 “there was more talk about electrified fences than there was about higher education and tuition,” Peter Wehner, a Republican speechwriter and strategist who served in the past three Republican Administrations, told me. “You can’t win elections when you do that.” Romney, who had called for the “self-deportation” of immigrants, received just twenty-seven per cent of the Latino vote—seventeen points less than what George W. Bush received in 2004. For years, Republicans have believed that they should be faring better with Hispanic voters. Ronald Reagan liked to say that Latinos are Republicans but “just don’t know it yet.” Lionel Sosa, a Texas adman who was hired to run Reagan’s outreach program to Latinos, recalled, “Ronald Reagan told me, back in the 1980 race, ‘Latinos are conservative people. As Republicans, we share the same basic conservative values. We believe in hard work. We believe in family.’ ”","3868","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For Wehner and other reform-minded conservatives, the lessons of 2012 were also economic. “The middle class felt vulnerable and nervous, because of stagnant wages for twenty-five years and skyrocketing costs in health care and higher education,” Wehner told me. “The Party needed an agenda, and it was out of touch with middle-class concerns.” The reformers urged the Party to get over same-sex marriage (a “losing battle”), focus on economic anxiety, and, above all, identify a leader who could articulate a vision that reached beyond Party orthodoxy. As Wehner put it, “You need a figure like a Bill Clinton or a Tony Blair, who can reassure the base and inspire them, but also to signal to people who are not voting for you, ‘We get it.’ ”","3869","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Whit Ayres, a leading Republican analyst who has been Rubio’s pollster for the past five years, drew a somewhat different lesson. He agreed about the demographic reality. “Unfortunately for Republicans, the math is only going to get worse,” he wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. “Groups that form the core of G.O.P. support—older whites, blue-collar whites, married people and rural residents—are declining as a proportion of the electorate. Groups that lean Democratic—minorities, young people and single women—are growing.” He calculated that, in order to win, a Republican Presidential candidate would need at least forty per cent of the Latino vote. But in “2016 and Beyond: How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America,” published earlier this year, Ayres made a subtle distinction between style and substance. He wrote that polls have found “no evidence that America has shifted to the left.” In his view, America remains a center-right country, the Party’s core ideas are sound, and the problem lies in finding “the right candidate, the right message, and the right tone.” He tested a range of ways of presenting core Republican ideas and composed a list of dos and don’ts. Don’t say we have to reform entitlements or “we will never balance the budget.” Do say that entitlement reform is “the only way to save popular programs.”","3870","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The Party’s plans to change its tone did not last long. In the 2014 midterm elections, conservative candidates seized on reports of a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the Mexican border, spurred largely by gang- and drug-related violence in Central America, and proclaimed an immigration crisis. Though the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended at the border was at its lowest level in decades, voters who were anxious about jobs and opportunity responded to increasingly militant language. When Trump announced his candidacy, this summer, he said of Mexicans, “They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Mel Martínez, the former Florida senator (the chamber’s first Cuban-American) and a former head of the Republican National Committee, told me, “Republicans say, ‘Mel, what do we have to do to get the Hispanic vote?’ And one thing I would say is, ‘First of all, stop offending Hispanics!’ ” He urged the parties not to regard a diverse range of voters as a single bloc. “The bottom line is that we are not ‘Hispanics.’ We’re Cuban-Americans, we’re Mexican-Americans, and so forth.” Cuban-Americans represent only about four per cent of the Latino population, and their votes and interests are not always in accord with those of other Latinos. For one thing, many Latinos resent the accelerated path to citizenship that Congress bestowed on Cuban arrivals during the Cold War, a privilege not granted to Colombians, Guatemalans, and others who have faced repression.","3871","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"“There are persuaders and there are crusaders, and I think Rubio is a persuader,” Wehner told me. “When you’re losing Presidential elections on a consistent basis, you’ve got to nominate somebody who is a persuader.” A conservative Super PAC ranked Rubio as the ninth most conservative member of the 114th Congress, but, unlike Ted Cruz, who amplifies confrontation, he excels at rounding off the corners of conventional conservative prescriptions. “I want to be the world leader in renewables,” he tells crowds. “But we better also be the world leader in oil and natural gas.”","3872","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"At times, Rubio’s desire to embrace competing views becomes unworkable. In January, he voted for a Senate resolution affirming that climate change is real, but he often voices doubts about the role of humans in it. I mentioned that this puts him at odds with the young generation that he wants to represent. He said, “People who are passionate about climate change come to us and say, ‘The environment is changing because of human activity. The scientists say so.’ And then they say, ‘And here’s what we want you to do.’ And so they present me with this idea, and I look at this idea, and I ask them, ‘Well, if I pass this, how many inches or feet of sea rise will it prevent?’ And they’ll say, ‘Well, it won’t prevent any.’ I say O.K. Then I turn to the economists and say, ‘What impact will this law have on the economy?’ And they say, ‘It will increase the cost of living, it will cost jobs, it will make America less competitive economically.’ And so I say, ‘So you’re asking me to pass something that’s bad economically and does nothing for the environment other than lead the way by example? I think that’s a bad trade-off. I’m not supporting those laws.’ ” (Ken Caldeira, a senior scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Department of Global Ecology, at Stanford, told me, “If Senator Rubio is talking to scientists who say that avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions won’t help avoid sea-level rise, he is talking to the wrong scientists.”)","3873","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s inclusiveness can invite caricature. He considers himself a Catholic, but he attends two churches—an evangelical Protestant service on Saturdays and a Roman Catholic Mass on Sundays. He used to proclaim his love of nineties-era hip-hop—particularly Tupac Shakur—but recently he has also taken to praising cross-genre artists, such as Drake and the Weeknd, who blend electronic dance music with hip-hop, rap, and R. & B. “It’s a twenty-first-century ability to take music and use it in a way that motivates people,” he said last month on CNN, mirroring his campaign rhetoric. “Some of it is blended with other sounds that are sampled from recordings that others have had in the past, and you see traditional artists being brought in and their voices used on an electronic soundtrack.”","3874","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s ecumenism is one reason that prominent Democrats consider him the most worrisome contender. David Axelrod, Obama’s former chief strategist, told me that Rubio “seems to be able to build bridges between the two factions of the Republican Party.” He said, “There is a real civil war going on between populist anti-government Republicans and the establishment conservatives, and Rubio has thus far been able to escape that divide.” Axelrod added, “But it’s going to be harder as time goes on, and he is probably going to have to plant his feet in one place or another.”","3875","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio if it concerned him that Republicans often appear to be at war with themselves. A day earlier, the House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, facing intense criticism by conservative members of his party, had abandoned plans to run for Speaker. “If the alternative was they all went into a smoke-filled room and cut a deal outside the limelight, everyone would say, ‘Oh, then it’s a done deal, it’s a stagnant process,’ ” Rubio said.

"Marco Antonio Rubio was born in Miami in 1971, the third of four children. (The oldest, Mario, became an Army Green Beret and, later, a city official in Jacksonville; Rubio’s sisters, Barbara and Veronica, live in Miami.) For years, he described himself, in political terms, as the “son of Cuban exiles.” “Nothing against immigrants, but my parents are exiles,” he said during his Senate campaign. “Folks that are exiles are people that have lost their country.” But in October, 2011, the Washington Post and the St. Petersburg Times reported that, according to immigration records, his family had left Cuba voluntarily, as émigrés, aboard a commercial flight, in May, 1956, more than two and a half years before Fidel Castro took power. Like many other immigrants, Rubio’s parents, Oriales and Mario, left in pursuit of jobs and opportunity. (Mario, the bartender, died in 2010.) The Post suggested that Rubio had embellished his story to gain cachet with political refugees, some of whom regard pre-Castro migrants with suspicion. Rubio called that suggestion “outrageous,” saying that he had relied on his family’s “oral history.”","3877","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s allies have defended his misstatements as an innocent error, but Guillermo Grenier, a sociologist at Florida International University, who studies the political attitudes of Cuban-Americans, told me that the explanation left many people unconvinced. “I think the dominant view is that he was misrepresenting his life story to make it more like the community he was trying to represent,” Grenier said. In a speech to the Hispanic Leadership Network, in January, 2012, Rubio said that the controversy had turned into “a blessing in disguise.” He explained, “It made me do something that we don’t do enough of. And that’s go back and discover who our parents were when they were our age.”","3878","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Because the Rubios had relatives in the United States, they gained a path to citizenship. Marco, or Tony, as he was known at home, was a strong-willed child. When the family moved to Nevada, he immersed himself in Mormon reading, and joined the Mormon Church, along with his mother and one of his sisters. A few years later, they reëmbraced Catholicism, “mostly at my instigation,” he wrote in “An American Son.” He also recalled that he was an “inattentive and undisciplined student.”","3879","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The autobiography of a sitting senator is a carefully manicured history. “I wrote a paper in the fifth grade praising President Reagan for restoring the U.S. military after it had been demoralized and allowed to decay in the years before his presidency,” he notes. But he writes vividly about the most influential figure in his childhood—his maternal grandfather, Pedro Víctor García, whom he calls “my closest boyhood friend.” According to Rubio’s biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia, in 1962 García arrived from Cuba without a visa and was eventually ordered to be deported. He stayed anyway, becoming an undocumented immigrant. The Cuban missile crisis saved him; commercial air travel to Cuba was suspended, and, eventually, he was granted permanent residency. In Rubio’s recollection, his grandfather spent much of his retirement in an aluminum chair on the front porch of his daughter’s home, smoking cigars and advising Marco on the alleged perfidy of Jimmy Carter:","3880","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Actually, Rubio’s politics were not quite so fixed. His father was a member of the Culinary Workers Union, and in 1984 it went on strike at Sam’s Town, the casino where he worked. Marco became an ardent supporter—making signs, blocking management’s cameras. But when the family ran low on money his father crossed the picket line. “I accused him of selling out and called him a scab,” Rubio wrote later. “It hurt him, and I’m ashamed of it.”","3881","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio what he took from that experience, and he replied, “That a thirteen-year-old has the luxury of being a hundred-per-cent idealistic.

"Today, he keeps his distance from the labor movement, and contends that workers now have advantages that his father’s generation did not. “The difference is, of course, that today, in Las Vegas and around the country, people have a lot more mobility,” he said. “In essence, if you don’t like what they are paying you at Sam’s Town, you can go work at, you know, the Venetian, or you can go work at Palace Station, or you can go work at the Wynn.” He went on, “I’m not anti-union. For example, I think we can work with blue-collar unions on a lot of issues.

"Yvanna Cancela, the political director of Local 226, of which Rubio’s father was a member, described Rubio’s image of workers’ options as unrealistic. “Rather than imagine an economy where workers have to leave a job to get a better life,” she said, “Senator Rubio should focus on how workers, like his father, have fought to create a standard so they don’t have to.”","3884","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In Marco’s junior year of high school, his sister Barbara’s husband, Orlando Cicilia, was arrested for his role in a drug-trafficking ring. Sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, he was paroled in 2000. (The connection to Rubio went unreported until 2012, when Univision revealed it, over the protests of Rubio’s aides.) The arrest added to the strain on the family. Rubio’s grade-point average at the end of his senior year was 2.1; he was allowed to graduate after attending summer school. He went on to a small college in Missouri, transferred to a community college, and ultimately graduated from the University of Florida, in 1993.","3885","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

After his sophomore year, he had called a local congressional office and got a summer internship, and then, in 1996, while in law school at the University of Miami, he was hired to run the local branch of Bob Dole’s Presidential campaign. On and off since high school, Rubio had been dating Jeanette Dousdebes, a Colombian-American who became a Miami Dolphins cheerleader. In 1998, they married, and they have four children, ranging in age from eight to fifteen.","3886","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

But in general I am shy.” She works part time for the family foundation of Norman Braman, a billionaire auto dealer and former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, who has been an unusually supportive patron of the Rubio family.

"Unlike most modern Presidential candidates, Rubio began his life in elected office at the lowest rung. (Jeb Bush’s first campaign was for governor.) Rubio was twenty-six and living at home with his parents when, in April, 1998, he won a seat on the five-member city commission in West Miami, a Cuban enclave with fewer than six thousand people.

"Raúl Martínez was the mayor of blue-collar Hialeah, and he greeted Rubio warily. “In my office, we meet, and you know what? He’s a very personable person,” Martínez told me. But over time he was put off by Rubio’s ambition. “Marco was the prince—he was the chosen,” Martínez said. “You can see him deciding, ‘Where’s my next move up the ladder?’ ” Nevertheless, Rubio accumulated mentors, including Governor Jeb Bush, who noticed him during his first race, for the West Miami commission, and called to congratulate him on Election Night. They became friends, and Rubio took every chance to praise Bush: “He’s practically Cuban, just taller,” he told reporters, and later said that, whenever he confronted a difficult problem in the Senate, he asked, “W.W.J.D.?”—What would Jeb do?","3889","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Within two years, in 1999, Rubio spotted an open seat in the state legislature. He didn’t live in that district, but he won a special election and moved his residency in time for the swearing-in. He arrived at an auspicious moment: newly installed term limits, inspired by a bonanza of corruption cases, were driving out senior lawmakers. He was sometimes mistaken for a clerk, but he embraced conservative doctrine—he read Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” twice in his first term—and attracted allies. Nine months later, he was the majority whip; two years later, he was the majority leader; and a year after that he was in line to be the youngest Speaker in Florida history, a post that he assumed in 2006.","3890","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

In the Bush family, however, the slogan was a tennis-court joke that George H. W. Bush used when he was preparing to serve.) Jeb told the audience, “I can’t think back on a time when I’ve ever been prouder to be a Republican, Marco.” Rubio displayed the sword on a wall of his office.","3891","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"For the work of political arm-twisting, he relied on two fellow-representatives, David Rivera and Ralph Arza—or “Boris and Natasha,” as Dan Gelber, the minority leader, nicknamed them, after the “Rocky and Bullwinkle” villains. “I said it jokingly, but there was a little bit of truth,” he told me. “Something would pop up in a bill, and I’d wonder how the hell it got there. Then I’d look at them and they’d smile.” Rubio’s lieutenants proved to be problematic. Arza was forced to resign from the legislature in 2006, after he used the word “nigger” in a drunken message left on a colleague’s voice mail. He pleaded guilty to intimidating a witness and agreed to undergo alcohol and anger counselling. Rivera (who had bought a house with Rubio in Tallahassee, to use when the legislature was in session) went on to Congress but has been the target of state and federal investigations into his income and into his alleged role in supporting a shadow candidate to undercut his rival in the 2012 campaign. He has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged. The Bush campaign, in a slide presentation to donors, has cited the friendship with the “scandal-tarred” Rivera as evidence that Rubio is a “risky bet.” Rubio aides tell reporters that the candidate rarely sees Rivera anymore, but Rivera and Arza were among Rubio’s supporters at the Republican debate in Cleveland.","3892","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio has struggled to manage his personal and professional finances. On several occasions, he used a Republican Party American Express card to charge personal expenses—$3,765 for landscaping stones at his house, ten thousand dollars for a family reunion in Georgia, a hundred and thirty-four dollars in a hair salon. In each case, he made good on the charge before it was publicly reported and explained it as a mixup. A state ethics commission investigated the incidents and cleared him, but that hasn’t stopped his opponents from bringing them up.","3893","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"His income has fluctuated dramatically. In 2000, his first year in the legislature, he was still saddled with student debt. As he ascended in the House leadership, he was hired by Broad & Cassel, a prominent law and lobbying firm, and his annual income grew to more than four hundred thousand dollars. In 2012, he received a contract for his memoir, worth at least eight hundred thousand dollars, and yet, even with his rising income, he cashed out sixty-eight thousand dollars from a retirement account, paying a heavy tax penalty. When reporters asked about it, he said, “My refrigerator broke down.” Political rivals wondered if he had a gambling problem, and searched for evidence but found none. Indeed, Rubio has incorporated the questions about his financial dealings into his self-narrative. “Here’s the truth,” he said, flanked by prosperous rivals, during the third Republican debate, in Boulder, Colorado. “I didn’t inherit any money.” He added, “But I’m not worried about my finances.

Oh, my gosh,’ ” Martínez recalled. Within a few years, Rubio was back, with a purpose. “I invited him to lunch in the Senate dining room, and I got the definite impression that he was kind of fishing around as to if I was going to run for reëlection or not,” Martínez said. “I thought it was a bit premature to be talking about that.”","3901","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

Martínez had announced his retirement, and Rubio wanted to challenge Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor, for the vacant Senate seat, but Party leaders had chosen Crist, and they told Rubio that they would oppose him with money and endorsements. Rubio’s friend Dennis Baxley received a text message from him: “I can’t quit thinking about U.S. Senate.

Small, far-right rallies were gathering steam around the state; they eventually became the Tea Party. Driving around Florida in an F-150 pickup, Rubio went to rallies, and he portrayed Crist as an ally of Obama. He accentuated new priorities. Previously, progressive immigration activists had considered him an ally, because he supported tuition assistance for the children of undocumented workers and used his power to bury hard-line anti-immigration bills. But now he renounced the tuition program; he made use of the phrase “illegal aliens,” and condemned the Dream Act, which would have protected undocumented young people, as a step toward “a blanket amnesty.”","3903","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

In the end, Romney chose the Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan. In materials shared with donors and reporters, the Bush campaign has alleged that Rubio was rejected because of concerns about his background.

The group coveted Rubio’s participation, because he had both Tea Party support and Latino heritage. In December, Senator Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the No. 2 leader in the Democratic majority, encountered Rubio in the Senate gym and recruited him to what became known as the Gang of Eight. Time put him on the cover with the tagline “The Republican Savior.” He blitzed conservative media and white Evangelical audiences, arguing that border security and citizenship had to be “interwoven” in the bill. “It’s literally impossible to do one part without doing the other,” he said.","3906","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

In October, he dismissed the bill as something “the Democrats in the Senate are demanding.” He stopped talking about immigration almost entirely. Matt Viser, of the Boston Globe, searched the Congressional Record and found that Rubio referred to immigration a hundred and thirty-five times on the Senate floor in 2013.

Flanked by enormous American flags, he told the crowd, in a message that pointed at both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, “Yesterday is over.” At the announcement, demonstrators from Latino advocacy groups carried signs declaring “El Sueño de Rubio Es Nuestra Pesadilla” (“Rubio’s Dream Is Our Nightmare”). On “Despierta América,” the morning newscast on Univision, the host Satcha Pretto noted the presence of the protesters, and said, “Many immigrants are already asking themselves, ‘Does he want to support us or deport us?’ ”","3912","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"After Rubio finished a speech one night in Las Vegas, I visited a community organizer named Leo Murrieta, who founded the Center for Latino Prosperity, a nonpartisan nonprofit that conducts research and advocacy. Barrel-chested and bearded, he wore a cardigan and rectangular glasses. Murrieta, who is twenty-nine, has heard Rubio tell his story over the years; he flashed a smile and said of himself, “My dad was a dishwasher and my mom was a housekeeper.”","3913","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"He was born in Mexico while his parents and three siblings were en route to the United States. A church helped them get green cards and allowed them to sleep in the pews for three years until they had saved enough for an apartment in a poor section of Las Vegas. “My parents would go without food. I don’t remember buying new shoes when I was a kid. But I think a lot of people go through that, in different ways.” He learned English from “Sesame Street.” “So I was the family translator until I was eight.” His older brother found work bagging groceries, and the family moved to West Las Vegas, another troubled part of town.","3914","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Murrieta became a naturalized citizen in 2010—“my American birthday,” he calls it. “It was the most beautiful moment of my life. And I registered to vote literally the moment after that, because all I ever wanted to do was vote.” In 2013, he worked nationally on immigration reform and labor issues. “I was blessed to be able to be in a lot of the rooms where policy was being discussed.” He said that Latinos would be receptive to a Republican message, but he thinks that the LIBRE Initiative promotes the interests of big business rather than the interests of the community.","3915","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked what he made of Rubio’s work on immigration reform. “He was for it before he was against it,” he said. “I’m an immigrant kid from the poorest parts of Vegas, and my family is touched by every form of immigration.” His brother-in-law and sister-in-law are undocumented. “This bill would have saved my family a lot of fear. You know, we still live in fear that our family is going to be torn apart.” He went on, “I’ve seen Marco Rubio give us lip service. I’ve seen him and his staff say that they support us. But then, when the spotlight is put on them, they don’t have the muscle to stand. And that’s not what we need in a President. We need someone who can stand up and stay true to what he’s said.” He added, “One of us has forgotten where we came from.”","3916","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The more we talked, the more dispirited Murrieta became about the state of the immigration debate in America. The Obama Administration’s executive actions, announced in 2014, would have shielded members of his family against the threat of deportation, but then a court ruling blocked that protection. His mother called him in panic. “She asked me, ‘Qué quiere decir?’—‘What does it mean?’ ”","3917","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Janet Murguía, the president and C.E.O. of the national council of La Raza, the largest Latino civil-rights and advocacy organization, told me, “People would underestimate the Latino community to think that they want to see a Hispanic President so badly that they’ll discard their positions on the issues. That’s ludicrous.” Of Rubio, she said, “He walked away from comprehensive immigration reform.” She added, “A measure of his viability is in how he is able to reconcile both his party’s demands and his natural inclinations.”","3918","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The Reverend Samuel Rodriguez is the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, which represents more than forty thousand evangelical congregations. He gave a benediction at the last Republican National Convention. He told me, “Let me really take the filters off: Marco Rubio’s de-facto one-eighty on immigration after the Gang of Eight failed was nothing other than a mistake. It was a serious mistake, and, I would argue, an ethical miscalculation.” Since then, however, Rodriguez has decided to give Rubio another chance. “I believe Senator Marco Rubio learned his lesson,” he said.","3919","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"A Gallup poll released in August found that among Hispanic voters Bush has a net favorability rating of eleven points; Rubio trails him, with five points. Clinton’s net favorability with Hispanics is forty points. But when I asked Lionel Sosa, Reagan’s Latino outreach director, how he thought Rubio would do with Hispanics in a general election, he said that although he had heard the criticisms, he thought they would fade. “The first Latino that has a chance to become President? All bets are off. I would say that he could easily capture sixty to sixty-five per cent of the Latino vote.”","3920","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"It was, perhaps, inevitable that Marco Rubio would open the deepest cut in the troubled campaign of Jeb Bush. For days before the third Republican debate, the Bush campaign had been criticizing Rubio for missing Senate votes this year. During the debate, Bush sensed an opportunity and turned to face his former protégé. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,” Bush said. “I mean, literally, the Senate—what is it, like, a French work week?” He delivered the line awkwardly, like a principal making a cameo appearance in a school play.","3921","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio stared at him evenly. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s vote record,” he said, and added, pityingly, “The only reason why you’re doing it now is because we’re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.” Applause rose from the audience. The phrase “Someone has convinced you” was lethal. Bush—suddenly in the role of the misled, desperate old pol—smiled wanly and tried to speak, but Rubio turned to face the camera. “My campaign is going to be about the future of America—it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage,” he said. “I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.” It sounded like a eulogy.","3922","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"The next day, Rubio appeared on six network- and cable-news shows and attracted three-quarters of a million dollars in donations online. Then came the mother lode. On October 30th, Paul Singer, the hedge-fund billionaire, who donated more money to Republican candidates and causes last year than anyone else in America, sent a letter to dozens of donors, encouraging them to help raise money for Rubio, calling him “perfect for this moment” and the best choice to “navigate this complex primary process, and still be in a position to defeat Secretary Clinton in November 2016.” Rubio had been courting Singer for weeks.","3923","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"A few days later, I met Rubio for breakfast in New York, at a restaurant in the Hyatt in Times Square. He arrived at seven-thirty, with two staff members, and slid into the booth. He ordered a cappuccino, and then called after the waitress, “Can I get a double shot of espresso in it?” He looked tired. He was trying to maintain a semblance of a routine: six hours of sleep, a gym visit for “anything that gets your heart rate up for thirty minutes,” a morning call to his kids on the way to school, and an uninterrupted block of time at home with his family on Sundays.","3924","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Half an hour earlier, Rubio had been on “Good Morning America,” talking about his finances, but the story seemed to be dying down—there weren’t many Americans who cared.","3925","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I suspected he might have more difficulty defusing concern that he is becoming indebted to powerful donors—some of the very same “people that can afford to influence the government,” whom he disparaged in his speech at St. Christopher. More than four in five Americans—an equal share of Republicans and Democrats—believe that money plays too large a role in political campaigns, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released in June. While Rubio was getting help from Singer, and perhaps Adelson, a nonprofit group called the Conservative Solutions Project—which, by law, can conceal the identities of its donors—was running millions of dollars’ worth of ads promoting him, more than any similar group devoted to a Presidential candidate.","3926","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked Rubio if he thinks Americans will worry that he is beholden to big backers. He shook his head, and said, “I’ve never had a single donor come to me and say, ‘I’ll support you, but only if you support this initiative.’ ” I said that sounded like a false standard, an unrealistic description of political influence. He continued, “People may not believe this, but the vast majority of big donors in America don’t really ask a lot of government—at least on our side of the aisle. What they really, largely, want is to be treated fairly and be left alone.” He added, “I’ve never changed any item on my agenda in search of a supporter.”","3927","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"On several issues, Rubio has taken a position that suits the faithful in the primaries but is guaranteed to repel voters in a general election. His most obvious vulnerability is on abortion. In the first Republican debate, Rubio said that his opposition to abortion extends to cases of rape or incest—a position at odds with that of more than three-quarters of Americans. Axelrod told me, “No exceptions is a position so extreme that no Republican candidate has ever held it. Presidential races are defined by moments. Maybe he will try to amend that position, but in the age of video it’s hard to extinguish a declarative statement like that.” When I asked Rubio about it, he said, somewhat confusingly, “Look, I personally believe that all life is worthy of protection, and therefore I don’t ever require, nor have I ever advocated, that I won’t support a law unless it has exceptions.” After some more twists and turns, I sensed that we had reached the line he plans to use in a general election: “My goal is to save as many lives as possible, and I’ll support anything that does that. Even if it has exceptions.”","3928","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"During the third debate, he had said that it was time to end an immigration system based largely on family ties. “That’s the way my parents came, legally, in 1956, but in 2015 we have a very different economy. Our legal-immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.” I told him that people have said that he is, in effect, pulling up the ladder after his family has reached safety.","3929","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"“I understand the argument,” he said, but he thought it was unfair. “In 1956, two people with barely any command of English, who had no formal education of any sort, were able to find jobs. In the twenty-first century, those jobs are scarce. . . . So I don’t think, for the country, it makes sense to continue to allow people to immigrate here in large numbers who we know do not have the skills or the education they need to succeed economically. It’s just a change based on new economic reality.”","3930","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"I asked what he thought would have happened to his parents if they had faced the system he is proposing. “It’s not clear what would have happened to them,” he said. “We can all get into hypotheticals about what would have happened two hundred years ago, or one hundred years ago, or fifty years ago, when somebody’s relatives came, but the world changes, and our policy has to keep pace with that.” He seemed dissatisfied with that answer, and went on, “Unlike most of the other people running, I live surrounded by immigration. My family are all immigrants. My kids go to school with kids who are immigrants. So this is not a theoretical issue for me. I live it personally. And it is hard. You know the stories of people that are here illegally, but it’s heartbreaking, because they came because they don’t want their daughter to be abducted by a drug gang in Central America. But the flip side of it is, every country in the world has immigration laws. And America has to have immigration laws, and if you don’t enforce them you don’t have laws. So this notion that somehow to be compassionate you have to be lawless is something I don’t buy, and I think most Hispanics don’t buy it.”","3931","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio’s campaign faces a range of tactical questions—Does he have the organization to win an early state? Will he lose his home state to Trump? Could Cruz win with only conservative and evangelical voters?—but the larger question will be harder to solve: Rubio has succeeded in politics by straddling as many positions as possible. He is the Catholic at the Protestant church, the quarterback of both teams, the joven viejo. But it isn’t clear that he can continue to do that and also be as bold as he would need to be to alter the Presidential prospects of the Republican Party in a changing country.","3932","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Since entering the primary, he had redoubled his language about enforcement. In October, he co-sponsored a bill that would punish “sanctuary” cities—localities that have objected to enforcing federal immigration laws. Democrats dubbed it the Trump-Rubio Sanctuary Cities Bill.","3933","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"If Rubio makes it to the general election, some of his positions are unlikely to budge. Hillary Clinton favors an activist American foreign policy, and Rubio mentioned to me that he was rereading “The Last Lion,” by William Manchester. He said, “It’s this book about Churchill. It’s really long. Only because I’m just so fascinated by the leadership he provided.” He went on, “Churchill was a guy who was largely ignored through much of the thirties as a warmonger, and a guy that was crying wolf, and Chamberlain was this heroic figure that was going to achieve peace in our time by diplomacy. And I think, in many cases, we’re kind of at a similar moment, where many of us, including myself, are warning about dangers that are percolating around the world and what they could turn into. Whether it’s Iran, Russia, China, North Korea, or radical Islam.”","3934","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In retrospect, those were the final moments of a phase in the Presidential campaign: when Islamic State militants assaulted Paris on November 13th, the candidates lurched away from talk of taxes and Wall Street regulations to face questions of national security. Jeb Bush, after straining, for months, to distance himself from his brother’s invasion of Iraq, said, “We should declare war” on the Islamic State, and called for the deployment of American troops “without their hands tied.” In a Democratic debate on the day after the attacks, Clinton said that the Islamic State “cannot be contained—it must be defeated.” She declined to identify the threat as “radical Islam,” saying that the term was “painting with too broad a brush” and risked alienating allies in the Muslim world.","3935","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Rubio held up that point as a flawed gesture of diplomacy. “I don’t understand it,” he said on ABC’s “This Week,” the next day. “That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren’t violent themselves.” It was a shrewd reply—the cool placement of safety over diplomacy—that nevertheless avoided Bush’s sharp turn toward war.","3936","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"But in reaching for a broad rhetorical vision Rubio presaged an instinct for aggressive intervention.“This is a clash of civilizations,” he told ABC. “There is no middle ground on this. Either they win or we win.” It was the politics of absolutes, a vocabulary that harks back to the with-us-or-against-us logic of an earlier era. Even George W. Bush disavowed the clash-of-civilizations argument. Rubio stopped short of specifying how many troops he wants to send to the Middle East, but he left no doubt that he believes such action is unavoidable. In an article that Rubio wrote for Politico, he said that the United States should “provide direct military support to Sunnis and the Kurds if Baghdad fails to support them.” He also called for no-fly zones in Syria, for grounding Bashar al-Assad’s Air Force, and for the establishment of “safe zones” to “stem the flow of refugees and provide a place to train and arm rebel fighters.” He said that he would “oppose Russia and Iran” in their efforts to buttress Assad’s regime.","3937","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"In one of our conversations, I asked Rubio if his instinct for intervention was out of step with a generation that is exhausted by war and confrontation, young men and women who have come of age in the years since September 11th. He responded instantly: “We’re not Luxembourg. We’re the United States of America—the highest-profile, most important, most influential country in the world.” He went on, “And we may ignore problems that exist far away, but those problems don’t ignore us. America, in the world today, is the only nation capable of convening collective action.”","3938","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"
"Barely two months before the first Iowa caucus, the debates about national security and immigration were converging in ways that Rubio seemed well positioned to exploit. In the days after the Paris attacks, more than thirty governors said that their states would resist the resettlement of Syrian refugees. Rubio, as he so often does, found a way to embrace two sides of a painful question, expressing both empathy and tough-mindedness. He said of the refugees, “It’s not that we don’t want to—it’s that we can’t.” ♦","3939","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/the-opportunist"

Knott pursues one kind of donor, and O’Doherty pursues another—inside money, outside money, you might say. Election laws forbid them from coördinating, so they have to be careful when they travel together. “We are very strict about not ending up in jail,” Knott said last week.

And then dropping into the Jefferson-Jackson dinner—it was like dropping into a show.” He began to evolve a theory that crisscrossing the country to raise money for a Presidential candidate is a lot like following the Dead. “You know the back roads, so to speak,” he said. “On tour and on the trail, you learn how to connect with people.”","3941","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"

He comes from a family of prominent Baltimore Catholics. His grandfather on his father’s side, Henry J. Knott, was a bricklayer who became a prosperous real-estate developer; the family foundation supports Catholic charities and schools. On his mother’s side, there are connections reaching back to the old Baltimore mayor Tommy D’Alesandro, Nancy Pelosi’s father. “My great-grandfather ran her father’s and brother’s campaigns,” Knott said.

We were the youngest guys in the room. We were fellow-Jesuits.” They also both liked music—O’Malley is a Springsteen fan and plays in a Celtic rock band. Knott was a chairman of O’Malley’s 2006 and 2010 gubernatorial campaigns. When O’Malley asked him, in May, to run the national campaign, Knott looked to Jerry Garcia: “I was like, ‘One good ride from start to end?

But, as Knott sees it, to the extent that Bernie Sanders, as an avowed socialist, is unelectable, and that Hillary Clinton is still vulnerable (“The only person who’s ever been able to stop her is her,” Knott said), his man would be next in line. “Last I checked, three minus two is one,” Knott said. “Our focus is Iowa, Iowa, Iowa, Iowa—and New Hampshire.”","3946","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/need-that-cash"

There was room for Neil Cavuto and Maria Bartiromo, two of FBN’s hosts, and for Gerard Baker, the editor of the Wall Street Journal.

"Near the beginning, John Kasich and Jeb Bush challenged Donald Trump on whether it is practical to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Later, Rand Paul got into it with Marco Rubio, questioning whether the Florida senator’s promises to build up the military and provide costly tax credits for moderate-income families could be described as conservative. (Rubio, as smooth as ever, insisted that they could.) There was even a discussion of too-big-to-fail banks and how to prevent a repeat of the collapse of 2008. It wasn’t a particularly coherent discussion, to be sure, but, at least, they talked about it.","3951","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"Unlike in the CNBC debate, where Rubio was the clear winner and Jeb Bush performed poorly, there were no obvious winners and losers on this occasion. Rubio and Cruz, who are by far the most polished debaters in this crowd, both fared well again, although they didn’t have it all their own way. Indeed, Cruz almost had a Rick Perry moment when he seemed to forget one of the five federal agencies that he has promised to abolish. Unlike Perry, who got caught in a similar predicament during one of the G.O.P. debates in 2011, Cruz saved himself by naming the Department of Commerce twice. (Note to young debaters: if you get stuck, repeat something you’ve said before.

"In addition to putting Rubio on the spot, Paul, the libertarian senator from Kentucky, who started his campaign with high hopes, got in a few shots at Trump and probably had his best debate yet. So did Bush, which, admittedly, isn’t saying much. “You’ll see a different Jeb Bush,” Al Cardenas, one of his Floridian pals, had promised, and so we did—up to a point. In his first answer, Bush promised to repeal virtually every regulatory rule that President Obama has introduced and took a swipe at Hillary Clinton, earning himself a sympathetic cheer from the crowd. Then, after Kasich had torn into Trump’s deportation plan, describing it as a “silly” proposal that “makes no sense,” Bush stepped in and backed the Ohio governor up.","3953","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"Sending back twelve million immigrants, Bush said, “is just not—not possible. And it’s not embracing American values. And it would tear communities apart. And it would send a signal that we’re not the kind of country that I know America is.” Maybe it was the influence of his new media coach, but, for once, Bush seemed exercised. “Even having this conversation sends a powerful signal,” he went on. “They’re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this. That’s the problem with this. We have to win the Presidency. And the way you win the Presidency is to have practical plans. Lay them out there.” With that, he moved briefly on to his own immigration plan, which includes a so-called path to citizenship for undocumented workers who obey the law.","3954","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"By Bush’s previous standards, this was practically Lincoln-versus-Douglas material. It also drew in Cruz, who, on this issue, is broadly aligned with Trump. After brushing aside a question about government spending, Cruz turned Bush’s words back on him, commenting, “You know, what was said was right. The Democrats are laughing—because if Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose.” While the mainstream media doesn’t often cover immigration as an economic issue, Cruz continued, “I can tell you, for millions of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue. And I will say the politics of it will be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande. Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press. Then we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation. And I will say for those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally, and we should enforce the law, we’re tired of being told it’s anti-immigrant.

"Cruz, as I said, is a good debater. There is a larger point here, too, though. This brief exchange exhibited the ideological and policy gulf that divides the Republican Party and will make it so difficult for a candidate like Bush, Kasich, or even Rubio, who has also endorsed a path to citizenship, to win the G.O.P. nomination. The would-be reformers may have reason and practicality on their side, but Trump, Cruz, and Carson are harnessing the passion, anger, and resentment that motivates much of the party’s base.","3956","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"It is for this reason, perhaps, that the actual content of the debates (as opposed to the surrounding theatre) hasn’t mattered very much so far—at least as far as determining the leaders in the opinion polls. By any objective measure, Trump has put up two or three poor performances. Once again, last night, he drifted out of the discussion for extended periods. Even when he was involved, he sometimes seemed to be struggling with policy details. Asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he delivered a lengthy rant about Chinese currency manipulation, only for Paul to remind him that China isn’t a signatory to the agreement. At one point, he snapped at Kasich, saying, “I don’t have to hear from this man, believe me.” And he complained about Carly Fiorina interrupting him, which came across as ungracious, to put it kindly.","3957","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"So far, this sort of thing hasn’t mattered much for Trump and Carson, and it might not matter this time, either. Although they tend to struggle under cross-examination on policy questions, both of these first-time politicians are perfectly capable of delivering miniature versions of their stump speeches and of sticking it to the media. Last night, it was Carson’s turn to holler “J’accuse!” Referring to a spate of recent stories about supposed inaccuracies in his life story as he has told it, he said, “I have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth.”","3958","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"In the G.O.P., there is nothing to be lost by picking a fight with the Fourth Estate, or by putting out political wish lists masquerading as economic plans. Throughout the debate, the candidates did a resolute job of sticking to their fantastical scripts about cutting the tax rate to ten per cent (Cruz and Carson), abolishing the payroll tax (Cruz and Paul), doubling the economic-growth rate (Bush), and somehow balancing the budget (everyone). At one point, a frustrated Bartiromo said to Cruz, “But you haven’t told us how to pay for it”—a remark that could have been directed at virtually any of the candidates.","3959","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"
"Looking a bit taken aback, for once, the voluble Texas senator conceded that a Washington outfit called the Tax Foundation had estimated that his tax cuts would cost $3.6 trillion over ten years, which is a pretty penny even in the Lone Star State. But that was the “static” estimate, Cruz added. If you looked at the “dynamic” estimate, which took into account the astonishing burst of growth and enterprise that his plan would unleash, the sea of red ink was reduced to just seven hundred and sixty-eight billion dollars.","3960","http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/policy-substance-intrudes-on-the-fourth-g-o-p-debate"

Eisenhower was no socialist, despite Sanders’s joke during the recent Democratic Presidential debate, though it’s been pointed out that a long career in the military, which provides cradle-to-grave assistance—for education, housing, and health care—does have its Scandinavian aspects. What continues to distinguish Eisenhower, though, is not the ninety-per-cent marginal tax rate he inherited but his calm disposition in times of crisis and his patient approach to major problems.

"You could hear Eisenhower at his best during a televised speech that he delivered on April 5, 1954, one he began by asking his listeners to survey America’s “strength, its problems, its apprehensions, and its future,” before attempting to do that. The talk was soon called the “multiplicity of fears” address (he’d actually used the phrase in a press conference a few weeks earlier) because, above all, Eisenhower wanted to tamp down what he properly sensed was enormous uneasiness in a world that had changed so rapidly in his lifetime. “Thirty-seven years ago tomorrow, our country entered the First World War,” he said; he had been a lieutenant, in Texas, serving with the United States Infantry. “My regiment was armed, as were all other regiments, with the same kind of equipment … as were the regiments that fought the Spanish-American War. Now, only a year ago, the hydrogen bomb was exploded in the Pacific. Last month, another series of tests was undertaken.” He continued, saying that “this transfer of power, this increase of power from a mere musket and a little cannon, all the way to the hydrogen bomb in a single lifetime, is indicative of the things that have happened to us. They rather indicate how far the advances of science have outraced our social consciousness, how much more we have developed scientifically than we are capable of handling emotionally and intellectually.”","3965","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"Because it was the height of the Cold War, the President acknowledged that “we are concerned about the men in the Kremlin,” who also had the bomb; he also mentioned the possibility of another economic depression. But what he most wanted people to hear was that “the greater any of these apprehensions, the greater is the need that we look at them clearly, face to face, without fear, like honest, straightforward Americans, so we do not develop the jitters or any other kind of panic, that we do not fall prey to hysterical thinking. Sometimes you feel almost that we can be excused for getting a little bit hysterical, because these dangers come from so many angles, and they are of such different kinds and, no matter what we do, they still seem to exist.”","3966","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"The speech seemed to work. Jack Gould, the Times television critic, wrote, “Heretofore his famed smile often has seemed hesitant and forced on TV. Last night it had its old warmth and infectious quality.” The Wall Street Journal, calling the speech “remarkable,” understood that the President’s purpose was “not to emphasize but to put in perspective the multiplicity of fears besetting the United States and the free world.”","3967","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"
"Sixty years later, some lessons seem to have been forgotten. Rather than urging calm in a world with the Islamic State and other dangers, Jeb Bush, who gets advice from Paul Wolfowitz, an architect of his brother’s catastrophic Iraq conflict, is urging the United States to declare war. Hysteria has become the leitmotif of Donald J. Trump, who suggests that we “strongly consider” shutting down mosques because “some of the ideas and some of the hatred, the absolute hatred, is coming from these areas.” Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz talk about clashes of civilizations and the “lunacy” of admitting refugees from the region. Have I left anyone out? Well, let’s not forget Carly Fiorina, who wants to give the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, the silent treatment while exploring her personal brand of brinksmanship: “I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose, rebuilding the military—the missile-defense program in Poland right under his nose,” she said at the last Republican debate. “I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states.” Hillary Clinton, as is her habit, has been careful, and a little vague, saying, “We have to be rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines,” while not exactly spelling out an American role. And so on.","3968","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/ikes-advice-how-to-avoid-a-multiplicity-of-fears"

"“Our goal tonight is to have a true debate,” CNN’s Jake Tapper said at the opening of Wednesday night’s entertainment. “A debate doubleheader” is what CNN called it, but the preferred sports analogy was to boxing. Last month’s feisty Fox News debate having been dubbed Round One—“If you think Round One was intense, you haven’t seen anything yet!”—an onscreen clock counted down the seconds to Round Two. The idea was to put the candidates in a ring two at a time, show them in split-screen, and poke them with sticks. “Tell Donald Trump why he’s wrong,” Tapper begged the candidates. They obliged with sucker punches and dodges but no knockouts. Like every other televised Presidential debate, except more so, Round Two was more of a long, disjointed, train wreck of a group interview than anything resembling an actual debate. Three reporters (but mainly Tapper) spent nearly five hours asking questions of fifteen candidates, in two sessions. They got canned answers, piety, and jibber-jabber. As debate, it was terrible; as television—“Hollywood Squares” meets “The Bachelor”—it was unlookawayable, at least for the first eight or ten minutes or so and then, really, you could look away, especially if you had something super important to do, like loading the dishwasher.","September 17, 2015","3970","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"

"The first televised Presidential debate was held between Kennedy and Nixon, in 1960. Nixon was expected to win, because he was a good debater, in the college-debate-society sense. Kennedy won because he didn’t debate; instead, he gave an excellent interview. The Kennedy-Nixon debate was followed by sixteen years of not bothering, but there have been televised Presidential debates since 1976, when Jimmy Carter bested Gerald Ford. Last night’s eleven-at-once is the largest number of Presidential aspirants on a debate stage, but not by much. In 2003, nine Democratic candidates appeared in front of CNN cameras, at the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix. That night, Carol Moseley Braun said Americans should elect her because “the men have ruined it, our country is a mess, it’s time to give a woman a chance,” while Howard Dean said the one thing he knew, from the polls, was that “there are five of us up here who are going to beat George W. Bush.” It turns out that most of what people say at debates is both forgettable and wrong.","3972","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"This year’s CNN G.O.P. debate was held in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. “By the end of this debate, this will be the most time I’ve spent in any library,” Lindsey Graham offered, cheerfully, during the four-man opening act. The podiums were lined up in front of a decommissioned Air Force One, which is on display in the library. George Pataki looked as though he wanted to open up a hatch and hide inside. Rick Santorum got uncharacteristically animated, talking about American workers. But Bobby Jindal won the Barry Goldwater Prize for Reckless Political Incitement when he said, “Immigration without assimilation is invasion.”","3973","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"What CNN called “The Main Event” started at 8 P.M. E.S.T., prime time, and obeyed an unwritten rule of television: the bloodier, the better. If a candidate mentioned another candidate, even if only in passing, that other candidate was given an opportunity to reply and encouraged to take a swipe. CNN must have thought this would make great television, and help draw an audience as big as the unprecedented number of viewers who tuned in for last month’s Fox News debate. The hitch here, though, is that televised Presidential debates are all or nearly all that many citizens see of the American political process. Is this how the nation’s political leaders want to model disagreement and deliberation in a democracy? By kicking each other in the shins? A lot of high-school kids were required to watch the CNN debate, and, in class, they’ll hold their own debates, applying the lesson this debate taught them, which is that appearance is everything and squabbling is everything else.","3974","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"“Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer,” Carly Fiorina said, when Tapper asked her if she wanted Trump’s finger on the “nuclear button.” Somehow this led to Trump arguing that “Rand Paul shouldn’t even be on this stage” and that Pataki, who in fact wasn’t on the stage, “couldn’t be elected dogcatcher.”","3975","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"

Ted Cruz reached for learnedness and never achieved it: as always, he looked nuts. Ben Carson had the best suit, and the gentlest and most appealing laugh, though he had very little to say. I forgot Scott Walker was there. Jeb Bush was nervous. He took a jab at Trump, claiming that when Trump wanted to open casinos in Florida, he’d tried to buy politicians with campaign donations. After Trump denied this, Carson piped in that he wouldn’t “lick the boots of billionaires,” which was memorable, but not in a good way.","3976","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"“If I were sitting at home watching this back and forth, I’d be inclined to turn it off,” John Kasich said, as things got fiery, fairly early in the debate, thereby revealing that, while he is a sane man among madmen, he has no real knowledge of American television.","3977","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"There was much discussion of the Iran deal, ISIS, and the Middle East. Rubio and Paul were sober. “This world is a mess,” Trump said, summing up his foreign policy. He blamed President Obama: “Somehow, he just doesn’t have courage.” Mike Huckabee declared, “This is about the survival of Western civilization.” The domestic version of Huckabee’s impassioned rhetoric was Fiorina on the need to defund to Planned Parenthood: “This is about the character of our nation.” Chris Christie blamed Hillary Clinton: “She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb.” This produced another spat between Trump and Bush. “You said you were going to cut funding for women’s health issues, you said it,” Trump said. “I heard you.” And, presumably because the subject was, vaguely, women, this led to Tapper raising the matter of Trump having said, in comments to Rolling Stone, that no one can stand to look at Fiorina’s face and later insisting that, by “face,” he meant “persona.” Shoved into the ring with Trump, Fiorina said, “I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.” Here Trump did a kind of curtsy: “I think she’s got a beautiful face, and I think she’s a beautiful woman.” And when the topic turned to immigration, and descended very quickly into the question of whether Bush ought to speak Spanish in public, and why Trump had insulted Bush’s Mexican-born wife, Trump refused to apologize and curtseyed again: “I’ve heard she’s a lovely woman.”","3978","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"
"It went on for a while after that. (“Can you believe @CNN is ‘milking’ it for almost 3 hours?” Trump had tweeted earlier in the day.) Near the end, Tapper cited former Reagan Secretary of State George Shultz, who has called for a more active government response to climate change, whereupon Christie called the notion that people can help fix the problem a “wild, left-wing idea.” Ben Carson turned a question about whether vaccines cause autism into an indictment of big government. In a round robin, Tapper asked the candidates which woman they’d put on the U.S. ten-dollar bill. Presumably, he meant American women, but Bush named Margaret Thatcher and Kasich came up with Mother Teresa. There was mention of Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, and Abigail Adams. Rubio made a compelling case for Rosa Parks. But three of the candidates apparently couldn’t think of any American woman worth honoring, and instead—more curtseying—suggested their own relatives, Carson his mother, Huckabee his wife, and Trump his daughter.","3979","http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/round-two"

"Last Tuesday, a group of refugees, many of them Syrians, walked quickly through a field outside the Hungarian village of Röszke. They had broken out of what amounted to a holding pen, where the authorities had kept them, in increasingly desperate conditions, for days. They were going to Budapest and then, they hoped, on to Austria, Germany, or Sweden. When the police tried to bring them back, they started to run. Reporters were there, too, and, as a man carrying a preschooler raced past a camerawoman, she tripped him, and he and the child tumbled to the ground. Her move was caught on video; another clip shows her kicking a small girl, wearing green pants, her hair in a ponytail, as she runs by. (The camerawoman has reportedly been fired.) What may be most remarkable about the scene is that the girl maintains her balance and doesn’t look back. She keeps going.","3981","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"“Everything which is now taking place before our eyes threatens to have explosive consequences for the whole of Europe,” Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, wrote in an op-ed earlier this month, and that is true, even if Orbán—who warns of Europeans becoming a minority in their own continent, their countries “overrun” and no longer Christian—is far from a reliable framer of the principles at stake. Many of the refugees are from Eritrea, Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan, but a growing proportion are Syrian, and the sense of hopelessness about the civil war there is a key reason that their numbers are rising. At transit points like the Greek island of Kos, people are sleeping in the open, but the tensions are not restricted to Europe’s less wealthy margins. The Danish government took out ads in Lebanese newspapers telling potential refugees that it planned to make life harder for them, and briefly cut off its rail connections to Germany, in order to curtail their movement.","3982","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"For some refugees, the journey to Europe began four years ago, when war broke out in Syria. They have spent months or years in crowded camps in Turkey, Jordan, or Lebanon, countries that have, together, taken in almost four million Syrians, putting stress on their political systems as well as on basic utilities. And yet the refugees’ presence seemed to strike Europeans as a sudden apparition, a late-summer storm. Harrowing images of a truck filled with bodies and of a toddler drowned on a Turkish beach were followed by scenes at Budapest’s central Keleti station, where thousands of refugees were kept from boarding trains to Western Europe. After many of them tried to head to Austria on foot, they were allowed for a time to proceed on buses and trains. On September 5th, they began arriving at Munich’s main station, where they were met by local volunteers bearing food, water, and, for the children, stuffed animals.","3983","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"Under what’s known as the Dublin System, the E.U. country responsible for a given refugee is generally the one in which he or she first arrives. But differences in geography and generosity have created imbalances. Germany and Sweden have said that they will effectively put aside the Dublin restrictions in the case of Syrian refugees, and many migrants try to avoid registering until they can reach one of those nations. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has surprised many with her emotional appeals to Europe’s conscience, has announced that Germany expects eight hundred thousand applicants for refugee status this year, and her government said that the country can absorb up to half a million applicants a year for a period after that. Last week, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, presented a plan for redistributing a hundred and sixty thousand refugees now in Italy, Greece, and Hungary according to a quota determined by members’ population and wealth. (France would take thirty-two thousand; Poland thirteen thousand.) But Hungarians say that if refugees had no prospect of going farther—if they knew that they would be stuck in Hungary—they wouldn’t come to Europe at all. In this cramped view, Germany has precipitated the crisis. Orbán called the E.U.’s policy “madness.”","3984","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"Perhaps there is a sort of madness at work, if that is what one calls the belief that a certain idea of Europe—democratic and at peace, chastened by the last century’s disasters, and without internal-border controls—is realizable. If so, it is a madness worthy of respect. (As well as improvement; the plight of Africans drowning in the Mediterranean has not mobilized public opinion in the way that the Syrians’ situation has.) But what about the idea of America? The best solution to the Syrian refugee crisis is an end to the Syrian war, but the elusiveness of that goal seems to have paralyzed the United States. Since the war started, this country has accepted just fifteen hundred Syrian refugees, not much more than arrived on a single train in Munich last week. Last Thursday, Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said that President Obama had told his staff that he wanted to “make preparations to accept at least ten thousand” Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year, which would count as a modest start.","3985","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/unopen-doors"
"The International Rescue Committee has proposed that the U.S. take sixty-five thousand Syrians, and some Senate Democrats, led by Amy Klobuchar and Dick Durbin, have supported that figure. Hillary Clinton, without naming a number, has suggested “an emergency global gathering.” The discussion, predictably, has become entangled in election-season posturing and alarmism. Jeb Bush, while acknowledging America’s historic status as a refuge, said that the President’s real job was to “take out Assad” and “take out isis.” Ted Cruz said that the refugees were better off in places closer to Syria, and Marco Rubio worried about terrorist infiltrators who might “sneak in.” Yet refugees seeking admittance to this nation are subjected to background checks and interviews far more thorough than those for ordinary immigrants. (The process, which can take years, should be speeded up.)

"And yet America’s triumphs have come, and we have been most ourselves, when we have opened our doors, and we have been most ashamed when we closed them. We have managed to respond quickly before—for instance, in 1956, when tens of thousands of refugees from a failed revolution were camping in Europe’s train stations. President Eisenhower ordered the airlift of fifteen thousand of them from Vienna and Munich to start new lives here.

"The keynote speaker at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, in Washington, D.C., is expected to be an agile performer: a preacher, but a nondenominational one; an orator, but a nonpartisan one. In 1997, the speaker was Benjamin Solomon Carson, who was both an accomplished pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University and, unlike most pediatric neurosurgeons, something of a celebrity. Ten years before, he had separated twins who were joined at the head, and he used the attention that followed to establish himself as a writer and inspirational figure. He grew up poor and black in Detroit, the son of a single mother who, he likes to remind audiences, could barely read. And he has a knack, common to great motivators, for making his accomplishments seem both extraordinary and achievable.","3988","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"“I don’t feel that I really belong here,” Carson said, when he took the lectern, but his casual posture and gentle smile suggested that he knew he did. The anecdotes he dispensed had been polished smooth over the decades, and they helped him administer a carefully calibrated dose of political and spiritual incitement. He lamented the secularization of American society, asserting that religious faith was no longer acceptable in political discourse. “If it’s in our Constitution, it’s in our Pledge, it’s in our courts, and it’s on our money, but we’re not supposed to talk about it, what is that?” he asked. “That’s schizophrenia!” But he also delivered a black-history lesson, enumerating a long list of African-American inventors who were, he said, absent from school textbooks, thereby depriving young black men of role models. Midway through his talk, he issued a whimsical—and bipartisan—call to action. “What if everybody in this room, with all your influence, wrote a letter to Kellogg’s and General Mills and said, ‘Put on your cereal boxes Nobel Prize winners and people of intellect, instead of just people who use sports and entertainment,’ ” he said. “Those kinds of things, I think, will make a big difference.” When he was finished, Bill and Hillary Clinton stood up to applaud, and they pumped his hand as he returned to his seat.","3989","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Perhaps President Obama was expecting a similar performance when he settled in for Carson’s encore appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast, in February, 2013. But by then Carson’s political vision had come into sharper focus. The political pundit and entrepreneur Armstrong Williams, a longtime friend and adviser of Carson’s who is currently his business manager, remembers watching Carson “agonizing” in the greenroom, as he tried to decide whether, and how much, he should criticize the President. In the end, Carson decided not to single out Obama, but he offered a strongly divergent view of America’s problems and potential solutions: he sounded an alarm about the national debt; he called for a strictly proportional income tax, based on the Biblical principle of tithing; and he laid out a health-care reform plan, which he said would reduce “bureaucracy”—a veiled reference, perhaps, to Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The speech became an online sensation, partly thanks to its unnamed target, who stopped smiling about halfway through and skipped an opportunity for a post-speech handshake. Clips have amassed millions of views on YouTube: “Obama Destroyed by Dr. Benjamin Carson’s Amazing Speech”; “Dr. Benjamin Carson Wipes the Smile off Obama’s Face.” (Among Carson’s fans, his honorific often serves as a term of affection.) And the speech inspired the Wall Street Journal to issue the first major endorsement of the 2016 campaign cycle: “Ben Carson for President.”","3990","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The Journal editorial wasn’t actually intended as a Presidential endorsement; it was a jocular salute to a newly minted folk hero, and a mischievous suggestion that even this political layman was more sensible than Obama. But the cult of Carson grew, aided by the formation of the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, and by tacit encouragement from Carson, who seemed to enjoy the speculation. Soon after the speech, he announced that he was retiring from neurosurgery and hinted that he was considering public office. This May, after two years of contemplation, he declared that he was running. He recalled praying for guidance. “Lord, I don’t want to do this,” he said. “But if you’re going to open the doors I will go through with it.”","3991","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During a recent appearance at a retirement community in Exeter, New Hampshire, Carson, who is sixty-four, was interrupted by residents making a common complaint: he was speaking too softly. He adjusted the microphone and leaned into it. “I can’t get it any higher,” he said. “It would be in my mouth.” And then he returned to his subject, which was the dire prospect of a country in which citizens were afraid to criticize their government. “Back in Nazi Germany, a lot of those people did not believe in what Hitler was doing,” he said. “They kept their mouths shut and they kept their heads down. And look at what happened.” Carson has an ability—honed, no doubt, during his previous career—to deliver alarming statements in a soothing manner. “Some people say, ‘Oh, nothing like that could ever happen in America,’ ” he said. “I beg to differ.” When he speaks, Carson sometimes blinks slowly, or closes his eyes in thought, and he uttered this last phrase in the same tone of voice that you might use to recount a pleasant dream.","3992","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson announced his candidacy, he was overshadowed by Jeb Bush, who was viewed as the favorite, and then by Donald Trump, whose groundswell began a few weeks later. But Carson kept speaking, quietly. Ryan Rhodes, Carson’s Iowa state director, says that the candidate’s “soft touch” is particularly effective among women voters and Evangelicals. By this fall, national polls showed Carson catching Trump, and even overtaking him. In some ways, this is not a particularly meaningful achievement: national polls, conducted long before the primary season has begun, have little predictive power. (At this point four years ago, Newt Gingrich was the front-runner.) And Carson’s big numbers have had little effect on the skepticism of political experts, who continue to believe that the next President will be a professional politician; Marco Rubio emerged as the betting favorite for the nomination, despite polling about half as well as Carson. Even so, it’s hard to think about the crowded cluster of Republican candidates for President without considering the startling fact that, for months, none were able to command much more support than a former surgeon whose campaign platform is barely more granular than the speech that made him a conservative hero three years ago.","3993","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Like most popular political candidates, Carson promises to deliver his audiences from politics. At campaign rallies, he gets a warm ovation when he inveighs against the nameless forces of division. (“They want Democrats to believe that Republicans are evil,” he says. “Or Republicans to believe that Democrats are evil.”) But that doesn’t make him a moderate. In Exeter, he condemned Planned Parenthood, saying that he would rather direct federal funding to “organizations that don’t engage in killing babies.” A few hours later, at the Durham campus of the University of New Hampshire, he warned about the peril of “global jihadists” and said, “There are many of them, already, within our nation.” That evening, he travelled to a boathouse on Goat Island, off the Portsmouth coast, where a group of local doctors had gathered to slurp milky clam chowder and listen to a former colleague share his belief that physicians should use their “healing instinct” to revive the country. Carson was in his element, joking about the hassles of dunning insurance companies and mentioning, briefly, his interest in trigeminal neuralgia. But even there he stayed on message: when a man in the audience asked about the rising cost of medical school, Carson suggested making colleges pay the interest on student loans, to help keep down tuition, yet firmly rejected the idea of universal government-funded college education. “Anything that we do to add to the debt right now is almost like treason,” he said.","3994","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"During the Obama years, there has been no shortage of conservative leaders eager to squeeze the words “debt” and “treason” into the same sentence. And there are moments when Carson seems almost retro, thrilling audiences with an anti-deficit, anti-Obamacare message that had already started to lose its freshness when he delivered that famous speech. What distinguishes Carson from his Tea Party predecessors is his biography, which also distinguishes him from the rest of the Republican field: he has been telling and retelling his life story for nearly thirty years, hewing to a narrative that emphasizes the Biblical virtues of grace and humility. Other candidates in the race, with the notable exception of Trump, have been reluctant to criticize someone so well loved, perhaps because they don’t view Carson as a long-term threat. In the most recent Republican debate, the other candidates not only refrained from trying to hurt Carson but seemed eager to help him. After he gave a meandering soliloquy in response to a question about banks, Rubio took it upon himself to implement a Troubled Assertion Relief Program, exclaiming, “He’s right on point, there.”","3995","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Journalists haven’t been quite so supportive: BuzzFeed recently posted an old video of Carson suggesting, in defiance of archeological scholarship, that the Egyptian pyramids were actually grain-storage units, built by the Biblical patriarch Joseph. During an excruciating Fox News interview after the Paris attacks, Chris Wallace tried and failed to get Carson to tell him which countries he would recruit to help fight ISIS. (Carson promised to involve “all of the Arab states—and even the non-Arab states.”) Last week, on an Iowa television station, Carson called his foreign-policy education “an ongoing process.” Two days later, he talked about the importance of screening refugees, using an infelicitous analogy: “If there’s a rabid dog running around your neighborhood, you’re probably not going to assume something good about that dog.”","3996","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, the scrutiny has led Carson to engage in atypically peevish exchanges with the media. Williams, his adviser, has been heartened by Carson’s willingness to fight back. “Somebody’s attacking your good name, your word,” he says. “He needs to get emotional. He needs to get fire in his belly.” It would make sense for any other politician to react this way, but Carson’s appeal is based largely on his seeming to be above the fray: a Baptist youth minister in Florida told me that he admired Carson because he was humble, and not “bombastic and adversarial”; a volunteer in Iowa cited his pledge to work for “all the people,” including the ones who wouldn’t vote for him. The most suspenseful thing about his surreal campaign is seeing how long he can stay in the fight without looking too much like a fighter.","3997","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson certainly seemed serene on a recent Tuesday afternoon in Florida, sitting in his temporary living room aboard a chartered bus emblazoned with his face; his head was framed by a backward “D” on the window behind him, the last letter of “BEN CARSON, M.D.” His wife, Candy, emerged from a private room in the back to show Carson a message on her mobile phone, and then disappeared. Carson pointed out that he is used to travelling a lot, and that he has been contending with big crowds for years. “When people would come to the clinic, they always would come with their cameras and their books to be autographed,” he told me. “The magnitude has just increased exponentially.” His campaign has followed an astonishing trajectory, but so has his life; he published his autobiography, “Gifted Hands,” in 1990, and it reads like an extended parable. He writes that his mother, Sonya, was a domestic worker, and sometimes left Ben and his older brother, Curtis, with neighbors while she sought clinical help for “confusion and depression”; his father, an autoworker and part-time preacher, left the family when Carson was eight.","3998","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson was raised in the Seventh-Day Adventist Church—he was baptized at eight and again, for good measure, at twelve—and he has remained a member. His surgical skill seems, in his telling, like a compensatory gift from God: afflicted with poor eyesight, he discovered that he had a knack for spatial visualization, making him well suited to navigate the delicate tangle of a child’s brain. Like many Adventists, Carson is a vegetarian, though he downplays any differences between Adventists and other Christians. Decades ago, in an interview in Vegetarian Times, he expressed certainty that meat eating would fade away by 2010, and that animals would “breathe a sigh of relief.” But, on the bus in Florida, he was eager to explain that his diet is merely a personal choice, and that he has nothing against meat eaters or hunters. He offered a brief explanation of his church’s best-known tenet. “There’s no place in the Bible that says the Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday, so we worship on Saturday, that’s all,” he said. “Does that mean that people who worship on Sunday are evil? No! Of course not.”","3999","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson recalls the two years that he and his brother spent in Boston, living with his mother’s sister: he remembered “winos and drunks,” as well as “squad cars racing up the street.” At the retirement community in Exeter, he added grislier details, saying, “I saw people lying on the street with bullet holes and stab wounds.” The Boston Globe talked to longtime residents of the neighborhoods where Carson lived, who remembered a less menacing atmosphere; one called the claim of bodies in the streets a “vast exaggeration.” Of course, Carson’s exaggeration, if that’s what it is, surely wouldn’t seem so vast if he were not a Presidential candidate; one suspects that few motivational speakers would emerge unscathed from an encounter with a pack of investigative reporters.","4000","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"A number of Carson’s favorite anecdotes seem impervious to research. When he tells his life story, he rarely omits the moment when, at the age of fourteen, he tried to stab another boy with a camping knife; he struck the boy’s belt buckle, the blade “snapped and dropped to the ground,” and Carson retreated to a bathroom, where he begged God to rid him of his violent temper. In Carson’s telling, the prayer worked. “Since that day,” he wrote, “I have never had a problem with my temper.” It says something about Carson’s reputation that reporters have grown suspicious not of his redemption but of his original sin: CNN talked to former friends and classmates and noted, solemnly, that “the violent, impulsive person Carson has described himself as is unrecognizable to them.” Similarly, Carson often talks about a moment of rage when he attacked his mother with a hammer, but, in 1988, the Detroit Free Press published an article in which Carson’s mother recalled the altercation differently. In her version, it was she who wielded the hammer, and might have used it, if Curtis had not intervened.","4001","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The most damaging potential debunking is also the least clear-cut. Carson was part of the R.O.T.C. program in high school, and in “Gifted Hands” he remembers being “offered a full scholarship to West Point.” But, earlier this month, Politico reported that Carson’s campaign had “admitted” that “a central point in his inspirational personal story was fabricated”: he had never applied to West Point, let alone been accepted, and the school does not charge tuition. But Carson had never mentioned applying, and so Politico, under pressure, softened its language, saying only that Carson “conceded that he never applied nor was granted admission.” Since then, the controversy has grown more obscure—it is now an argument over what “offered” means, and whether a West Point representative might have made some encouraging remarks that Carson misinterpreted. In a press conference, he called the reports a “witch hunt.” Raising his voice (possibly for the first time all year), he claimed that Obama had not faced similar scrutiny. “There is a desperation, on behalf of some, to try to find a way to tarnish me,” he said, dejectedly—unlike Trump, Carson takes no visible pleasure in tangling with the media. “It’s just ridiculous!”","4002","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"For Carson, being attacked is a relatively new experience. In the years after “Gifted Hands” was published, he turned his autobiography into an industry. He embarked upon a never-ending speaking tour and founded a charity, the Carson Scholars Fund, which has recognized more than six thousand students for their “academic achievement and humanitarian qualities.” His book spawned nine sequels, and also two documentaries, a cable-television feature film (starring Cuba Gooding, Jr.), and a long-running play in Baltimore, which was often performed for schoolchildren judged to be in need of supplementary edification. The legend of Dr. Carson was ubiquitous in the predominantly African-American schools of Baltimore. (The essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates, who grew up there, wrote, of Carson, “I saw him speak so many times that I began to have that ‘This guy again?’ feeling.”) It was ubiquitous, too, in many churches around the country, where Carson’s story served as proof that faith could conquer all. Many of the people who wait in line to hear his stump speech think of him primarily as a religious figure, which is part of the reason that the media skepticism hasn’t harmed him. Like his policy positions, which are often vague or confusing, the precise details of his biography matter less to voters than the opportunity he offers them to become characters in his uplifting story.","4003","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” politics rarely intrudes. Carson joined his high school R.O.T.C. program in 1967, a few months before the Detroit riots, but the book makes no mention of them, or of the uproar over the Vietnam War, or of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Carson recently told the Wall Street Journal that, during the riots inspired by King’s assassination, he sheltered some white students in the high-school biology lab, although the Journal could not find anyone to corroborate this story.) Carson says that he was brought up to be “a fairly partisan Democrat,” but he evidently wasn’t much interested in activism. He attended Yale during a tumultuous period: in 1970, near the end of his freshman year, the campus was overtaken by protests that accompanied the trials of members of the Black Panther Party, who were accused of murder. (Hillary Clinton, then studying at Yale Law School, served as a liaison to the group that planned the protests.) But his campus life seems to have revolved mainly around Candy, his wife, a fellow-student who was also from Detroit. She is the author of a forthcoming book about their marriage, the co-author of his last three books, the leader of the Carson family string quartet (they have three grown sons, who fill out the lineup), and, he often says, the only woman he has ever been with. One of the black student leaders in those days at Yale, Kurt Schmoke, says that Carson was not among the rabble-rousers. “The Ben Carson I knew in college was a very studious person—focussed like a laser beam on going to medical school,” he says.","4004","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson got his medical degree from the University of Michigan and, in 1977, arrived at Johns Hopkins, where he became known as a precise but imaginative surgeon. Readers who have heard about his life-saving feats might be surprised to learn, in “Gifted Hands,” how many of his best-known surgeries ended in disaster, or in a more equivocal result. Benjamin and Patrick Binder, the German twins who played such a large role in Carson’s career, were seven months old when the operation took place: Carson and his team had to temporarily induce hypothermic arrest so that they could disentangle the interlaced blood vessels before the babies bled out. Both survived the operation, but they suffered brain damage, and one has since died. One of the things Carson learned is how not to become paralyzed by self-doubt. He likes to say that he has performed fifteen thousand surgeries, which would mean an average of more than one a day, for more than three decades.","4005","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In Baltimore, Carson was a friend and ally of Schmoke, the former student leader, who transformed his activism into a career in elected politics: from 1987 until 1999, he served as the Democratic mayor of Baltimore, and he and Carson often talked about ways to support young people in the city. At one point, when a Democratic gubernatorial candidate sought Carson’s endorsement, Schmoke urged him to decline, so as not to damage his spotless reputation. “I guess I thought that his story was above partisan politics,” Schmoke says now, chuckling. Back then, Carson liked being politically uncategorizable. In his book “The Big Picture,” published in 1999, he noted with satisfaction that he had once heard hosts on a radio show arguing over whether or not he supported Louis Farrakhan’s Million Man March. Carson conspicuously declined to settle the question. Elsewhere in the book, he preëmptively defended himself against the suggestion that he was a conservative Republican. “I’m not,” he wrote, adding that he would accept no political label more restrictive than “independent.”","4006","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Schmoke remembers the day, some years ago, when Carson casually mentioned that he was skeptical of the scientific consensus on evolution. Schmoke thought he was joking, but Carson made clear that he wasn’t. “I said to myself, ‘Gosh, there must be a lot of things that Ben believes that I’ve never talked to him about,’ ” Schmoke recalls. Carson now says that his political outlook began to shift in the nineteen-eighties, when he found himself captivated by President Reagan’s message of “self-empowerment.” That became Carson’s message, too, although for many years he delivered it in nonpolitical terms. “Gifted Hands” begins with a letter from Carson’s mother, who reprises one of her favorite phrases: “If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame.” In one passage, Carson declares that it is time for “minorities” to “stand on our own feet and refuse to look to anybody else to save us.” But later, in a discussion of “disadvantaged kids,” he suggests that there is “a system precluding these people from achieving.” Of course, self-help and systemic change need not be mutually exclusive. And, anyway, as a surgeon and motivational speaker Carson didn’t have to choose.","4007","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson registered as a Republican only a year ago, as he considered running for President. By all accounts, it was the battle over health care that pushed him to finally embrace a political party. In 2004, President George W. Bush appointed Carson to his Council on Bioethics, and Carson began thinking more seriously about how the federal government might rein in the insurance industry, which seemed to him to consume too much of the nation’s medical spending. At a town-hall meeting in 2005, organized by the Congressional Black Caucus, he suggested a health-care system modelled on “something that already works”: the food-stamp program. (He liked the idea that recipients could shop for medical care, just as food-stamp recipients shop for groceries.) Two years later, at a council meeting, Carson suggested that, if insurance could be made more affordable, universal coverage could be achieved by fiat. He said, “There is where the government perhaps comes in and makes it mandatory, just like it’s mandatory for you to have automobile insurance.”","4008","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"These ideas don’t seem radically at odds with the reform bill that President Obama eventually passed. But as the debate over the Affordable Care Act began, in 2009, Carson was dismayed to find himself shut out of the process: Obama disbanded Bush’s Council on Bioethics, and Carson tried in vain to secure a Presidential meeting. “It left him very disappointed, and devastated,” Williams says. The 2013 Prayer Breakfast speech was an expression of frustration, and also a final attempt to get through to a President who seemed intent on ignoring Carson’s expertise. On the campaign trail, Carson rarely fails to mention his idea for “health savings accounts,” which would be personal and shareable: family members could contribute to each other’s medical bills, and seniors might pass on leftover funds to their descendants. He hasn’t fully explained how these accounts would be set up, or what would happen to patients who depleted theirs. Even more than the competition, he is devout in his belief that systemic problems can be solved by topical applications of common sense.","4009","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"By the time Carson launched his campaign, he had completed his evolution from Democrat to independent to eager exponent of movement conservatism. He evinced a newfound passion for gun rights. And although the Adventist Church suggests that in some “exceptional circumstances” a woman might justifiably choose to terminate a pregnancy, Carson is now “unabashedly and entirely pro-life.” Like any successful speaker, Carson knows how to read a room, and he admits that his transformation has been aided by his recent immersion in politics, and by the receptive audience that he has found among conservatives. He has emerged, for instance, as an advocate of tightened immigration laws, arguing that children born in the U.S. to unauthorized immigrants shouldn’t be given citizenship. “In talking to a lot of Americans, I realized how strongly they feel about people who come here illegally, and I think that probably has influenced me,” he says. “Because if you want to be a representative of the people, in a republic-type government, then obviously you have to represent what they feel.”","4010","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson’s bus arrives at an event, his supporters often break into applause, although some find other ways to express themselves. In Waterloo, Iowa, a woman hopped in place, in anticipation of being in his presence; more than one fan, after shaking his hand, bent over and wept. In Florida, the crowds included eager teen-agers and shuffling seniors but only a small number of African-Americans. Carson occasionally acknowledges that his ideological journey has put him at odds with black voters, who play a vanishingly small role in the modern Republican Party. On the bus, which was trundling from his hotel, in Clearwater, to a Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Carson thought about how, exactly, Democrats manage to win so many African-American votes. “Don’t you think Lyndon Johnson had it right?” he said. “I’m sure you’ve heard his quote where he said, ‘Give those N-words a few goodies and we’ll have their vote for the next two hundred years.’ ” The quote comes, lightly paraphrased, from a book by Ronald Kessler, who attributes it to a former Air Force One steward, who said that he overheard a conversation between Johnson and “two governors.” The line is meant to illuminate the cynicism of Democratic politicians, although, by crediting it, Carson can’t help but belittle the intelligence of African-American voters, too. This tactic is common in politics, where leaders often devise patronizing explanations for the otherwise unaccountable fact that people sometimes vote for their opponents. (Think of Obama’s claim, during the 2008 campaign, that inhabitants of depressed towns “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them.”) But the notion of black voters as dupes for white politicians has a particularly nettlesome history in the U.S., stretching back to Reconstruction; nowadays, some Republican politicians prefer to simply say, instead, that their party needs to get better at reaching out.","4011","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Because Carson is African-American, he need not be so circumspect—one of his advantages is his willingness to talk about race in language that his rivals would be wise to avoid. He has called Obamacare “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,” and has said, of abortion, “I think it’s a moral issue—just like slavery was a moral issue.” While blasting Planned Parenthood, he asserted that its founder, Margaret Sanger, “believed that people like me should be eliminated or kept under control.” (Sanger did suggest preventing “feeble-minded” people from having children, but there is no evidence that she supported sterilization on the basis of race.) Some of his gentler formulations, too, convey a coded racial appeal: Carson often excites largely white audiences by sketching a vision of racial harmony, just as Obama once did. When he tells crowds that “our unity is what provides our strength,” he could be echoing Obama’s famous claim, from the 2004 speech that made him a national figure, that “there’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America.”","4012","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Some of Carson’s biggest supporters see race as an important part of his appeal. Unlike Obama—and, for that matter, Herman Cain, the African-American businessman who briefly captivated Republican voters during the 2012 campaign—Carson entered this race as a figure well known and widely admired in African-American communities. John Philip Sousa IV, the leader of an unaffiliated pro-Carson political-action committee, is the author of “Ben Carson: Rx for America,” a slim paperback that is given out free at Carson events. (The front cover announces, “Over 1,000,000 in Print!”) Sousa, a great-grandson of the composer, argues that Carson could attract a significant minority of the African-American vote, enough to make a Democratic victory mathematically impossible; a Carson Presidency, he argues, would “forever destroy” the “false narrative that conservatives and Republicans are racists.”","4013","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"There is something paradoxical about Sousa’s argument, which urges Republican voters to agree that race matters in order to demonstrate that it really doesn’t. As Carson’s audience has changed, he has modified how he talks about race, in ways that make him more acceptable to the party he recently joined. Writing in 1999, he affirmed his belief that “our justice system metes out different treatment to blacks and whites,” and declared that police in a Detroit suburb had recently arrested his mother and impounded her car, because she matched the description of a suspect. Now he suggests that African-American frustration with the criminal justice system is misdirected. “I just don’t agree that that’s where the emphasis needs to be,” he says.","4014","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"At times, there are signs of tension between Carson’s old life, as a community-minded motivator, and his new life, as a Republican favorite. During one recent appearance, his customary reminiscences of boyhood gave way to a memorable digression about the joys of throwing rocks at cars. “Everybody did it, because it was so much fun,” he said, and he chuckled at the thought of police officers scrambling to catch him and his friends. “Of course, that was back in the days before they would shoot you,” he said. He stopped himself. “I’m just kidding,” he said, adding that he had “a tremendous amount of respect for the police.” He paused to accept the crowd’s applause, and, back on safe ground, added that the police were “the very last people that we should be targeting.”","4015","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"When Carson mentions racial uplift, he often adds a quick disclaimer, noting that his policies are meant “not only for African-Americans but for everybody.” Sitting on the bus, though, he advocated a kind of economic separatism. “If we would learn how to turn our dollars over in our own community, two or three times, before you send it out—that’s how you generate wealth,” he told me. “That’s how the Jews did it. That’s how the Koreans did it.” Half a century earlier, Malcolm X made a strikingly similar argument, saying, “If we try and establish some industry in our own community, then we’re developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind.” Of course, Malcolm X’s entreaty was accompanied by a caustic corollary that probably would not impress the Republican electorate. “Once you gain control of the economy of your own community,” he added, “then you don’t have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business.”","4016","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"If Carson has a specific pitch to African-American voters, it is indistinguishable from his general economic pitch. He wants to lower taxes for everyone in order to spur economic activity and raise interest rates, so that poor and middle-class families can earn more interest in their savings accounts. And he wants to allow corporations to repatriate overseas money, tax free, if they use ten per cent of it to “create jobs for unemployed people and people on welfare.” His campaign’s outreach to African-Americans has consisted largely of a radio advertisement featuring a hip-hop track that not even Carson seemed to enjoy. (“I probably would have taken a little different approach,” he said after it was released.) Maybe it doesn’t much matter, given the racially polarized state of American politics. Florida, for instance, is about seventeen per cent African-American, but exit polls conducted there in 2012 suggest that only about one in a hundred Mitt Romney voters was African-American. Sometime in the future, black voters might help Republicans win the Presidency. But in this cycle it’s highly doubtful that they will help a Republican win the nomination.","4017","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Earlier this fall, Carson startled the press corps—and some of his own advisers—by cutting back on his campaign schedule so that he could promote his latest book, “A More Perfect Union,” in which his political platform takes the form of a constitutional exegesis. (Carson’s ten books all cover pretty much the same territory, and so some conceptual ingenuity is required to keep his bibliography growing.) The plan, which Carson explained by saying that he wanted to fulfill his obligations to his publisher, puzzled many observers; National Review posted a blog item under the headline “this isn’t normal.” And yet the book tour helped him—or, at any rate, didn’t hurt. During October, when he was mainly off the campaign trail, his popularity increased. National polls showed him in a virtual tie for first place, with Trump; in Iowa polls, for the first time, he was the front-runner. At book signings, hundreds and even thousands of fans lined up to buy a copy of “A More Perfect Union,” have it signed, and maybe get a quick handshake. Carson apparently hasn’t lost his surgical dexterity, because often he executed the handshake while holding an uncapped Sharpie in the same hand. At a Books-A-Million in Kissimmee, Florida, employees made sure that customers didn’t linger for more than a few seconds, but one man brought the line to a halt. Bob Santos, a fellow-Adventist who had first heard about Carson through his church, had spent more than five hundred dollars on a basketful of Carson books, which he planned to distribute to friends and relatives. Once Carson had worked his way through the basket, Santos seemed exhilarated, even though he hadn’t quite got everything he wanted. “I thought he was going to personalize one of them,” Santos said. “He said he can’t.”","4018","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Before Carson’s Presidential campaign was a campaign, it was a business—one largely independent of Carson himself. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision allows political-action committees to be more or less unregulated, so long as they don’t coördinate their activities with official campaigns. In December, 2013, Carson told potential supporters that none of the groups soliciting on his behalf had his blessing, but the pro-Carson groups didn’t need it. They kept making money and plowing it back into fund-raising, creating a virtuous and potentially lucrative cycle. The following year, as the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee—run by Sousa and Vernon Robinson, a political entrepreneur—was raising millions, Armstrong Williams suggested that the organization was dishonest. “People giving money think it’s going to Dr. Carson, and it’s not,” he said, adding, “I don’t like misleading people.”","4019","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Once Carson announced his candidacy—yielding, he said, to the people who had been “clamoring” for him to run—he had to make peace with the Carson industry. Williams now believes that the unaffiliated PACs are “not as exploitative” as he had thought, and concedes that they have played an important role in boosting Carson. Williams says that he is careful not to communicate with the Super PACs. (He suffered a scandal of his own, a decade ago: he was working as a syndicated columnist, and it was revealed that the Bush Administration had paid him to promote its No Child Left Behind Act.) This must require special vigilance, because his brother, Alvin Williams, runs Black America’s Political Action Committee, which solicits donations in order to “push Dr. Carson to victory.”","4020","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"The official campaign has proved adept at fund-raising, too, using expensive telephone and direct-mail solicitations to reach small donors. Last month, the Federal Election Commission reported that Carson’s campaign had raised nearly twenty million dollars from donors who had given two hundred dollars or less—vastly more than any other Republican. Bush, Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Chris Christie have all attracted much more Super-PAC money than Carson, while Trump has attracted about as much as he seems to need, which is none. But, if individual donations were votes, Carson would be the people’s choice.","4021","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"This is partly a matter of strategy: Carson’s campaign devotes an unusually large portion of its spending—more than fifty per cent—to fund-raising. It is also a result of Carson’s status as a kind of conservative eminence, the kind of figure who makes people excited to put a check in the mail. At the Barnes & Noble in Tampa, Sousa’s Super pac was outside in the parking lot, selling T-shirts and giving away copies of his book. An independent vender was there, too, hawking buttons. One showed Carson with hands clasped in prayer; another said, “Vote Republican—we can’t ALL be on welfare!” An elderly man wandered through the store, gawking at the line of customers that snaked around the bookcases and outside into the muggy afternoon sun. “Is Ben Carson here?” he asked a store manager. “I’ll probably vote for him—but I hate those annoying phone calls.”","4022","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson’s determination to do right by his publisher, Penguin, has fuelled speculation that he is more interested in making money than in becoming President. Indeed, Carson seems as proud of his business acumen as of his surgical skill—he often reminds voters that he has served on the board of both Kellogg and Costco, and promises to reinvigorate government by bringing in people he knows from “the business world.” One of Carson’s connections has caused him some trouble during the campaign: Mannatech, a multilevel-marketing company that sells nutritional supplements it calls “glyconutrients.” In 2009, the company agreed to pay six million dollars to settle a suit, brought by the Texas attorney general, which accused it of claiming that its products “cured, treated, or mitigated” a list of ailments that included cancer, autism, asthma, toxic-shock syndrome, and attention-deficit disorder. Carson has given speeches at Mannatech events, and he appeared in a regional public-television program about brain health, sponsored by Mannatech distributors, in which he stressed the importance of glyconutrients. When I asked about Mannatech, he said the company had behaved in a way that was “a little bit dishonest,” by uploading a promotional video he appeared in that was supposed to be available only to sales associates. But even now, when discussing the company’s product, Carson can’t help but offer a sales pitch. “I use it every day,” he told me. “Since I’ve been taking it, the incidence of me getting sick has dramatically declined.”","4023","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Many of Carson’s supporters are true believers: they earnestly explain how he and no other candidate could pull the country together. It can be harder to detect what Carson himself wants. Throughout the campaign, he has shown relatively little interest in the specifics of policy. His tax plan is more like a statement of general principles—he wants everyone to pay the same rate, but he hasn’t specified what that rate would be. And his foreign policy can seem like one long improvisation. During a recent debate, he responded to a question about Syria and Afghanistan with a confusing claim that “the Chinese” were active in the region; in the days afterward, the campaign clarified that Carson hadn’t meant to suggest that Chinese troops were present in Syria. At times like this, Carson’s insistence that he is a reluctant candidate can seem all too convincing—a few months before he officially announced, he told a medical journal, possibly in jest, that he would be relieved if he didn’t win. Williams remembers Carson saying, of the people urging him to run, “Maybe they see something in me that I don’t see.”","4024","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Most Republican strategists maintain that voters will eventually settle on a more conventional choice, chastened by the prospect of President Carson or, more likely, of another President Clinton. But the rise of unaccountable PACs has weakened the party élites, which means that no one seems to have the credibility to tell the Republican base that nominating Carson might be a bad idea. The increasing messiness of the modern political primary has been, so far, a Republican story; this is in large part an accident of history. In Obama, the Democrats have had a leader who inspires loyalty. But in the next election cycle, or the one after it, the Democratic Party, too, may confront a base of voters eager for a candidate who has as little affection for politics as they do. Perhaps sober, élite-approved Presidential candidates, seasoned by decades of political experience, will come to seem as old-fashioned as network news anchors, and for some of the same reasons.","4025","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson is, even more than Trump, the ultimate 2016 outsider. In the years since the Prayer Breakfast, he has often played the role of soft-spoken firebrand, standing up for the core principles of conservatism. But one sometimes gets the sense that his ideological conversion is incomplete. The Club for Growth, a small-government think tank, often criticizes the timorousness of the Republican establishment, and it has been critical, too, of this year’s insurgents. The group’s Super PAC spent half a million dollars on a television ad to tell Iowa voters that Trump “supports higher taxes.” (The claim relied heavily on a Trump tax proposal from 1999; the Trump campaign responded with a cease-and-desist letter.) David McIntosh, the group’s president, says that he was alarmed by Carson’s suggestion, in a 2012 book, that it was possible to “extract socialism’s positive aspects and actually implement them within capitalism.” (Carson was referring to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps.) McIntosh is not reassured by Carson’s frequent paeans to liberty. “In the Republican primary, ‘free market’ and ‘less government’ are the buzzwords,” he says. “I think he may be using those, but they don’t really reflect a well-thought-out philosophy of the role of government.” The group says it is “unable to conclude that Ben Carson would be a pro-growth president,” but its Super pac has not spent money attacking him, because it does not view him as a serious threat. “As he gets closer to the election,” McIntosh says, “people will say, ‘I’m not sure he’s ready, yet, to be President.’ ”","4026","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"Carson believes that readiness is overrated. “There’s no one person who knows everything,” he says, and he is confident in his ability to learn as he goes. But his struggles with difficult questions about governance have made that confidence harder to credit. There are signs that his popularity in Iowa is beginning to ebb—some polls suggest that Trump has regained a narrow lead there. Carson became a front-runner by deploying his motivational skills on his own behalf: he inspired Republican voters to believe that they could have any kind of President they wanted and that they did not need to settle for a mere politician. Now some of them may be realizing that there is no alternative to politics—no way for a retired neurosurgeon to become a Presidential candidate without becoming a politician, too.","4027","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"In “Gifted Hands,” Carson admitted, “I don’t handle failure well,” although he added a humblebragging clarification: “I guess the Lord knows that, so He keeps it from happening to me often.” It’s not clear that he would regard an inability to win the Presidency as a failure. If the media interrogations grow too withering, or the polls too discouraging, Carson might happily return to a new version of his old life, talking and speaking a bit more about his journey out of Detroit, and a bit less about tax rates or military movements in Syria. In the meantime, he is enjoying the crowds and the adulation. At a recent book event in Lakeland, Florida, fans filled the parking lot, and a book-tour staffer climbed onto Carson’s tour bus to photograph the scene. A small media pen had been set up near the portable lectern where Carson was signing books, and he strolled over to take questions. One reporter wanted to know how he had been preparing for the next debate. “By listening to your questions,” Carson said.","4028","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"“Are they good questions?”","4029","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"“Some of ’em are,” Carson said, chuckling, and then he walked back to the lectern, to sell a few hundred more books. ♦","4030","http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/a-wing-and-a-prayer-the-political-scene-kelefa-sanneh"
"On Thursday morning, the filmmaker, Brooklyn native, and grand marshal of the New York City Marathon Spike Lee was comfortably perched in Central Park offering a limited screening of what he announced was his latest “short, short joint.”","October 30, 2015","4031","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
"“It’s a love letter to the greatest city on this planet,” Lee, clad in a blue camouflage tracksuit and bright-orange glasses, said. Running under three minutes (a short preview can be found online under the title “Da New Yawk Joint”) and set against a sweeping jazz score, the film will air before the broadcast of the race, on Sunday morning. With Lee’s signature staccato rhythm, the film briskly cuts through images that Lee said represented “the people the food the diversity the culture, architecture, all the stuff that makes it New York.”","4032","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
"Alongside many shots of New York City’s culinary delicacies, Lee’s short film highlights Do the Right Thing Way (the intersection that pays tribute to Lee’s 1989 classic), plus Times Square, Chinatown, the Brooklyn Bridge, Chris Rock, a park-goer with a bird on her shoulder, firemen, brownstones in “the Republic of Brooklyn,” Cumberland Hospital (the birthplace of Mike Tyson and Michael Jordan), Coney Island, the 9/11 Memorial, the Apollo Theatre, and so on.","4033","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
"“Boston is not even in the running,” Lee said.","4034","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
"Lee is the first New Yorker to serve as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon in the forty-five-year history of the race. The marathon has only had two other grand marshals in its history (the Czech runner Emil Zátopek, in 1979, and Norway’s Grete Waitz, in 2003); organizers said that they wanted to bring on a quintessential New Yorker this time. Lee, who also teaches film at New York University and will soon receive an honorary Oscar, fit the bill.","4035","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
"Lee’s short played on a screen in a pop-up media tent near the marathon’s finish line, to a varied crowd: in addition to the phalanx of elite runners, including the Paralympic wheelchair champion Tatyana McFadden and the returning New York City champions Mary Keitany and Wilson Kipsang, was a stable of security guards muttering into earpieces and the New York City police commissioner, William Bratton. The mood was light, despite this dash of officialdom, an atmosphere Lee seemed determined to sustain as he presides over what is sometimes touted as New York City’s “largest block party.”","4036","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
"When he was first approached by New York Road Runners executives about the opportunity, Lee said he was eager to play a part, having watched the race many times from the corner of Lafayette Avenue and South Elliott Place, in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, as a youngster.","4037","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"

"A fair amount, it turns out. Earlier this week, Lee travelled to Bristol, Connecticut, to confer with ESPN, a broadcast partner of the marathon. On Thursday, after débuting his film, under perfect running skies, Lee and other officials engaged in the ceremonial painting of the blue line that marks the path of the 26.2-mile course through the city. “All five boroughs,” Lee said. “Even Staten Island!”","4039","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
"On Friday evening, Lee was scheduled to make an appearance at the marathon’s opening ceremony alongside the Hall of Fame inductee Paula Radcliffe, a three-time champion of the race. Sunday morning would be a long affair, as Lee would lead the race seated in the back of a convertible with his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee. The wheelchair athletes are the first at the official start, at 8:30 A.M., followed by the professional women, at nine-twenty, and then the professional men, along with the first wave of amateurs, at nine-fifty. Three more waves will bring the total to more than fifty thousand runners, from all fifty states and more than a hundred and twenty-five countries, the last of them setting off at eleven. Lee said he didn’t plan to leave his vehicle and that he and his wife planned to “take lots of pictures” along the way.","4040","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
"This will be his first time seeing the marathon from the finish line, he said. And, in spite of the pomp inherent in leading the sweaty parade, he was wary of taking too much of the spotlight.","4041","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"

"Lee took the opportunity to proclaim his support for the New York Mets in the World Series, even though he’s a Yankees fan. (“But if they don’t win Friday night, it’s ovah. O-V-A-H,” he said.) He also expressed his support for Hillary Clinton in the Presidential race. (“I think that she is the best person now to continue what Obama has done the last eight years.”) And he challenged an Italian reporter who implied that the pizza in her country bested the pies of New York. (“Grimaldi’s!”)","4043","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
"In addition to Lee in the convertible, several other celebrities will be at this year’s marathon, running: the retired professional tennis player James Blake, Katrina Bowden (formerly Cerie on “30 Rock”), Ethan Hawke, the soprano Susanna Phillips (who will be singing the national anthem before running the course), and Alicia Keys.","4044","http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/spike-lees-marathon-prep"
