"President Obama has long been a friend of organized labor, wholeheartedly supported by unions that helped boost him to victory in both his presidential campaigns.But increasingly, there now is a divide between unions in the public and private sector when it comes to supporting him.","Published February 17, 2015","1","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/17/are-private-unions-cooling-toward-democrats.html"
"According to James Sherk, a labor policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, government employee unions want ""bigger and more expensive government,"" in contrast to private sector unions.","2","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/17/are-private-unions-cooling-toward-democrats.html"
"Sherk added those private groups are ""pushing back"" and speaking out more publicly about things like the Keystone XL Pipeline, which they believe will benefit their members. That has put them on a collision course with Obama, who last summer proclaimed, ""We should do everything we can to strengthen unions in this country.""","3","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/17/are-private-unions-cooling-toward-democrats.html"

"Although the tax doesn't kick in for several more years, as far back as 2013 union leaders were making public pleas to Democratic lawmakers. In a letter written in July of that year, union officials, including James Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, urged congressional Democrats to drop the tax saying, ""We voted for you.We have a problem; you need to fix it.""","8","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/17/are-private-unions-cooling-toward-democrats.html"
"Analysts say the issue may present an opportunity for GOP leaders to build some good will with unions. Just days ago, Rep. Frank Guinta, R-N.H., introduced a measure he's calling ""Ax the Tax.""A similar measure didn't get far in the Senate last year, but may have a better chance with the GOP now in control of both the House and Senate.","9","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/17/are-private-unions-cooling-toward-democrats.html"

"DAMAGED GOODS NO BARGAIN FOR DEMOCRATS Another day, another revelation of ethical misconduct in Clintonland. This time it’s the Boston Globe’s discovery that the largest single non-profit group in the Clinton network utterly ignored the disclosure agreement that Hillary Clinton promised would be a bulwark against corruption during her tenure as secretary of state. Foreign donations exploded during Clinton’s tenure as America’s chief diplomat, but her organization said nothing about it. At the same time, we are learning more about the astronomical overhead in the Clinton family’s charitable network. So it is no wonder that Politico reports that the donors who have funded the multi-billion-dollar enterprise – the kind of folks who go on whirlwind Africa tours with Bill Clinton – are getting queasy about the new scrutiny and the serial improprieties. Their world is shrinking down to folks like billionaire Tom Steyer, who openly embrace the Washington cash-for-influence game. So what’s a conscientious liberal to do? The GOP is out of the question. Republicans are tumbling over themselves to seek the favor of the super PAC donor whales who are preparing to fund potentially hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of red-on-red attack ads in the coming months. This isn’t a big problem for GOP voters, though, since the members of the party widely oppose restrictions on political spending. But for liberal Democrats, these are famine times. The wife of a former president is preparing to claim by regal right their party’s nomination. She is mired in a scandal that involves boatloads of cash from unseemly sources, the violation of basic transparency standards and the destruction of huge troves of documents. To go from “hope and change” back to “no controlling legal authority” is a far fall indeed. But there’s nothing else to be done, right? Wrong, say liberals. A fake primary is just what’s in order. While Matt Taibbi is quite right that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is about as real as it gets in Washington, the response to his declaration for president has been as phony as the bust lines at a Georgetown brunch. Others are still touting “the virtual candidate” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and her supposed ability to make the Clintons compliant. (Because people who were not bound by bulletproof language in disclosure agreements drafted by teams of lawyers can be counted on to honor backroom deals with rival politicians… ) But Sanders is really running and he is driven by a righteous ideological fire, sort of a Rick Santorum of the left – a Jeremiah warning his party of the dangers of falling away from the faith of its fathers. Millions of pixels are being poured out about how Sanders could make things “interesting” and “shape the Democratic race.” Some of this is the lamentable but understandable product of beat writers looking for any hook on which to hang a necessary long-shot-candidate-declares write. Some of it seems sincere. Consider Jill Lawrence who is ecstatic over “an explosion of substance” on the Democratic side. Well… Yes, Clinton gave a policy talk (in which she repudiated policies set in place by her husband but without explaining any part of her head-snapping reversal), but the Democratic race still isn’t one. Imagine if on this date the only declared candidate standing athwart Jeb Bush’s drive to the nomination was Santorum. How would Republicans feel? That’s the sinking feeling that will be setting in for Democrats over the months to come. The enormous empire built by the Clintons – plus the consequences to the party’s bench from successive midterm waves – has scared everyone out of the field except for a Jeremiah and, perhaps, a couple of guys who don’t appeal to the party’s base. Liberal Democrats may like the idea of a phony primary that nudges Clinton on ideology, but shadowboxing with a socialist senator from Vermont who is six years older than the 67-year-old presumptive nominee won’t keep Clinton busy, even for six weeks. With no race, there’s no interest. With no interest, there’s no pressure. Reform-minded Democrats are looking for a way to make it right to coronate the woman who has more fully inhabited the Washington establishment than perhaps any national politician of her generation. Good luck in your rationalizing. THE JUDGE’S RULING: ROUNDHEADS ON THE POTOMAC Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano looks back to the dark days of Oliver Cromwell to underscore that the Constitution is designed to not only to prevent the perception but also to prevent the reality of the tyranny of one man’s opinion: “President Barack Obama has rejected not only the theory but also the practice of due process by his use of drones launched by the CIA to kill Americans and others overseas.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Researchers and scientists announced that they found remains of the first feathered dinosaur in North America, reports Discover magazine. Though the fossils found do not have an individual name yet they are part of the Ornithomimus family meaning they look similar to the modern-day ostrich. The discovery caused a stir in the paleontology world, but gave more questions than answers, particularly on the purpose for the feathers since feathered dinosaurs are not thought to fly. A floated theory is that they used them as means of communication, or momentum when running on the ground. Regardless of the purpose, researchers are already hot on the chase for more feathered dinosaurs and the purpose for the additional feature. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Jeb Bush declared Wednesday that 11 million immigrants in the country illegally should have an opportunity to stay, wading yet again into his party's contentious immigrant debate. ‘We’re a nation of immigrants,’ Bush said at the National Christian Hispanic Leadership Conference that brought several hundred Hispanic evangelical leaders to Houston this week...A successful immigration overhaul is more than simply strengthening the border, Bush said, referring to ‘11 million people that should come out from the shadows and receive earned legal status.’ He said such immigrants should be required to pay taxes, work and not receive government benefits.” “I do not come to you tonight with the ability to speak Spanish. But I do speak a common language. I speak Jesus.” – Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in a speech to the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference in Huston following a speech in which Jeb Bush had spoken in English and Spanish. Carolina whales wary - (Raleigh)News & Observer: “Jeb Bush is planning to meet privately with top donors – and potential ones – in Raleigh and Charlotte on Friday before heading to the state GOP convention in South Carolina …. Two of the state’s biggest Republican donors – former state budget director Art Pope and Raleigh businessman Bob Luddy – tell [the News & Observer] they are planning to attend. Luddy mentioned Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as ‘all excellent candidates’ along with Bush. He said he is not sure Republicans would coalesce behind Bush ‘for a variety of reasons,’ including perceived baggage from George W. Bush’s presidency. “He has a hard road to go,” Luddy said of an expected Jeb Bush campaign.” [Bush is in Washington today for a fundraiser for his Right to Rise PAC hosted by top lobbyists and other family loyalists.] Power Play: Will Jeb’s big bucks make the biggest difference? - There’s a lot of money sloshing around the presidential primaries campaign, but will winning the donor race make the difference?

Ted Cruz, R-Texas] advanced a theory as to why a candidate with his views can succeed with the Hispanic vote, insisting that Romney’s tough talk on immigration had nothing to do with the relatively anemic 27 percent of the Hispanic vote he mustered in his 2012 campaign. ‘The media repeatedly said the reason Mitt Romney got clobbered in the Hispanic community was because of immigration,’ Cruz said during a question-and-answer session at the National Press Club. ‘The data don’t bear that out,’ said Cruz, adding that Hispanics care most about the economy. ‘The Obama economy has been a disaster for the Hispanic community,’ he said. The reason Cruz Romney got ‘clobbered’ was his ‘infamous comment’ that Republicans don’t have to worry about the 47 percent of all Americans vote reliably Democratic because they feel entitled to government services. ‘I can't think of a statement in politics I disagree with more strongly,’ said Cruz.” Picks Iowa campaign chairman - USA Today: “Former Iowa secretary of State Matt Schultz will lead the Iowa campaign for Ted Cruz as the Texas senator seeks the Republican nomination for the presidency…Schultz currently serves as the Madison County attorney, a post voters elected him to in November.” RUBIO PUSHES HARD FOR ISRAEL AMENDMENT NYT: “Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, is demanding a vote on an amendment that would press Iran to recognize the state of Israel, threatening a fragile bipartisan coalition that had already fashioned a compromise bill giving Congress a voice in the Iran nuclear talks. As other Republican senators worked to persuade their colleagues to pass the bill largely unchanged, Mr. Rubio, a candidate for president, seemed determined to press a series of amendments that would significantly toughen the legislation, and if passed, would almost certainly provoke a veto by President Obama, who is already reluctant to give Congress any role in an Iran deal. ‘This is not a game,’ Mr. Rubio said. ‘This is a very serious matter.’”","36","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/30/damaged-goods-no-bargain-for-democrats.html"
"[Hey, neighbor - Rubio will be on Hillary Clinton’s posh Georgetown block today for a fundraiser hosted by her neighbor, mega-donor Wayne Berman.] WALKER BOASTS WIDEST DONOR NETWORK NYT: “Scott Walker enters the Republican presidential race with far stronger ties to the party’s biggest fund-raisers than any other candidate besides Jeb Bush. Roughly half of the nation’s top 250 Republican donors have given money to Mr. Walker in his campaigns for Wisconsin governor, according to an Upshot analysis of Federal Election Commission records and state records. By comparison, 30 percent have given to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, 20 percent to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 10 percent to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.” RAND’S RABBI FOR JEWISH VOTERS JUMPS TO WALKER Free Beacon: “Sen. Rand Paul’s (R., Ky.) most prominent pro-Israel backer, who funded the senator’s 2013 visit to Israel, is throwing his support fully behind Gov. Scott Walker’s prospective presidential campaign, he told the Washington Free Beacon. Rich Roberts, a major Republican donor from New Jersey, has been central to Paul’s Jewish outreach efforts. The former pharmaceutical executive, who has been described in the press as one of Paul’s ‘ambassadors to the Jewish community,’ has hosted private receptions for the senator over the past few years, assisted as an informal adviser, and sponsored his highly-publicized Israel trip.” NEW FIORINA BOOK FIRES BACK AT CRITICS OF HP TENURE The Hill: “Carly Fiorina’s political future depends on whether she can defend her record as CEO of Hewlett-Packard. The likely GOP presidential candidate is aiming to do just that in her new book Rising to the Challenge, set to be released May 5, a day after the expected launch of her 2016 campaign. Fiorina now claims the company’s decision to fire her in 2005, after a turbulent six-year tenure, was a result of a dysfunctional board of directors and not her leadership…When asked again if she thought underlying sexism contributed to her firing, she said, ‘There’s no question that women in positions of authority are scrutinized differently, criticized differently and characterized different.’ Following her departure, she said HP officials monitored her phone calls to see if she had been the one leaking the negative information...HP declined to comment for this article.” Grabs Garcia’s backing in N.H. - Former New Hampshire Congressional candidate Marilinda Garcia puts her support behind Fiorina. Garcia’s offered her backing in a Concord Monitor op-ed, saying Fiorina’s experience as a CEO and leadership in her community make her the best choice. After the piece was posted, though, Garcia was accused of lifting parts of it from Fiorina’s official biography. [Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security, a hawkish national security group, hosts Fiorina for its first forum in New Hampshire today.] EX-CHRISTIE AIDE TO PLEAD GUILTY IN BRIDGE SCANDAL USA Today: “David Wildstein, who allegedly orchestrated the 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, will reportedly plead guilty to federal charges this week. Wildstein was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s second-highest ranked staffer at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the fallout from the week of intentional, crippling traffic jams severely damaged Christie's political aspirations.” IS SNYDER SERIOUS? The Detroit Free Press goes deep on Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder’s intentions and chances in an already crowded 2016 GOP field: “The buzz about a possible Snyder bid for the GOP presidential nomination is expected to ramp up further when he conducts a series of media interviews while attending an event as a guest of Michael Bloomberg in New York on May 8.” BUDGET BROUHAHA SETS UP OBAMACARE FIGHT Senate and House Republicans announced a unified budget plan Wednesday that allows them to bypass Democrats and send legislation that repeals or revises ObamaCare to the president’s desk, while balancing the federal budget within 10 years. Though the plan is non-binding and spending bills must be passed, the proposal lays out the Republican vision of how to handle the taxpayers’ money. With the 2016 political battlefield in sight reaction was swift. Democrats called it a “gimmicky” plan that paves the way for tax break for the wealthy, while Republicans said it would make Washington “live within its means.” A vote in the House is expected Friday with the Senate following suit next week. [Winners and losers - National Journal takes a look at the compromises leading up to the GOP budget plan] What’s in the plan - Bloomberg: “The budget proposal spells out the Republican Party’s priorities by calling for $5.3 trillion in spending cuts to reach balance in nine years. Of this, $4.1 trillion in reductions would come from programs including entitlements like Medicare. Discretionary spending in 2016 would be limited to $1.016 trillion, while war funding would total $96 billion, far above Obama’s request. The plan allows total spending of $3.9 trillion in 2016, with a $400 billion deficit.” Early snag on VA spending bill over war fund - The Hill: “House Republicans delayed a vote Wednesday night on their first spending bill of the year amid concerns that a controversial bipartisan amendment to eliminate use of a Pentagon war fund for military construction projects might have the votes to pass….[House] leadership decided to push back votes on the legislation…until Thursday. The amendment offered by [Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C.,]… would strike provisions of the bill for military construction projects that use funds from the Pentagon's war fund known as the Overseas Contingency Operations account. Both Van Hollen and Mulvaney argued it represented a budgetary ‘gimmick’ to avoid spending caps established by the 2011 budget deal known as the Budget Control Act (BCA).” MCCONNELL LAUNCHES SURPRISE OFFENSIVE ON EPA WashEx: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he plans to use a little-known, little-studied, little-used Clean Air Act clause to undercut a key element of the Environmental Protection Agency’s attempt to cut carbon emissions from power plants. The Kentucky Republican cited language in the Clean Air Act, the federal law under which the EPA is crafting its climate change regulation, that he said requires Congress to approve regional cap-and-trade plans and other compacts. That’s key because the EPA has touted multi-state plans as the best, most cost-efficient way to meet its proposed rule’s goals, and some states are planning to use that strategy.” SUNDAY’S GOOD NEWS IS… Fox News colleague Dana Perino may not always like what’s on the pages of the New York Times, but there’s one upcoming edition she is sure to like. A publishing industry source tells Fox News First that Dana’s book, “And the Good News Is…” will be number one on the NYT nonfiction bestseller list on Sunday, May 10. Not bad for a farm girl!

"Already, a top-ranking Senate Democrat has renewed pressure on Obama to slow his diplomatic outreach to Cuba and to Iran.

"“Mr. Secretary, after five decades of authoritarian, one-party rule, we must recognize that the Castros will never relax their iron-fisted control over Cuba unless compelled to do so,” he wrote. “As the Administration pursues further engagement with Cuba, I urge you to link the pace of changes in U.S. policy to reciprocal action from the Castro regime.”","139","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/21/friendly-fire-dems-challenge-obama-agenda.html"

"Shortly afterward, the senator scorched administration officials at a Senate committee hearing over their pushback on lawmakers’ effort to set up new potential sanctions against Iran.

"“It’s the right thing to do,” Obama said. “I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.

"The cloud will become a self-destructive storm for the Democrats if their left-wing faction, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., joins with right-wing Republicans.","217","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"The Tea Party element reflexively wants to block any bill that could one day be counted as an achievement for Obama.","218","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"The popular Sen. Warren is framing her concern over the proposed trade pacts by pointing to past deals that she contends pushed “America’s middle class in a deep hole,” while boosting big business and Wall Street investors.","219","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"On the other hand, Senate Democrats can find motivation for supporting the president by looking at a June Pew poll. It found 59 percent of Americans backing free trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.","220","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"More motivation comes from history. President Bill Clinton won approval of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) from a Republican Congress. In 2002, it was a Republican majority that again gave “fast track” power on trade deals to the Bush White House. Congressional Democrats have to be concerned about being left behind one more time on this critical issue.","221","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"In this go-around, Democrats on Capitol Hill risk looking less like faithful defenders of the working class than bystanders to the changing reality of global trade.","222","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"Obama is hoping he can pull the majority of Senate Democrats to his side by making precisely this argument.","223","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"“Those who oppose these trade deals ironically are accepting a status quo that is more damaging to American workers,” the president told the Business Roundtable in December. He cautioned Democrats to not “fight the last war” over problems with lost jobs due to the NAFTA deal.","224","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"“There are folks in my own party… that have legitimate complaints about some of the trend lines of inequality, but are barking up the wrong tree when it comes to opposing [the Trans-Pacific Partnership],” the president said.","225","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"“Globalization is a force,” Michael Froman, President Obama’s U.S. Trade Representative, recently told John Harwood of The New York Times. Froman, who is leading negotiations with Democrats in Congress, acknowledges problems with past trade deals as well as middle-class anxiety about competing against low-pay workers overseas. But Froman, like Obama, insists new markets for American products will lead to increased exports, more jobs and high wages.","226","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"Globalization is “out there because we have container ships, because we have air travel, because we have broadband,” Froman told The Times, echoing his words in meetings with Democrats. “That’s made it easier for companies to locate at different places around the world. Trade agreements are how we shape globalization.”","227","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"Despite the power of that logic, doubts persist among Democrats. When Democrats held the Senate majority they stonewalled Obama on trade deals. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he could not sell “fast track” powers in the face of opposition from labor unions and environmental groups, key elements of the Democratic constituency.","228","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"Already, 150 of the 188 House Democrats have signed letters of opposition to giving the president an up-or-down vote on so-called “Fast Track” authority on negotiations for a 12-nation deal. This is the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The nations that would be included under such a deal would account for 40 percent of the global economy. But in January Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., branded “Fast Track” as an “insult to the American worker” and promised there was no way her fellow Democrats would support it. “We are not going to do it.”","229","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"Among Republicans, opposition to the trade deal is based in their long-standing opposition to any proposal from Obama.","230","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"There is also Tea Party distaste for ceding U.S. sovereignty to an international group governing the trade deal. But Republicans look like they have the votes to pass the bill in the House and Senate. They are helped by two things: fear of Chinese domination of Asian trade and overwhelming pressure from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and Wall Street.","231","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, have promised to deliver the votes. Ryan calls increased trade the key to growing good-paying jobs in the future.","232","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"
"“I agree with every word [in Obama’s State of the Union address] with respect to trade and Asia and getting in there and helping write the rules instead of China writing the rules,” Ryan told reporters, adding that the deal means “more jobs for America.”","233","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/02/17/democrats-will-splinter-on-trade-deals.html"

Why waste our time and yours on what was shaping up as a coronation? But the ongoing and far-from-finished scandal around Hillary Clinton’s use of a secret home email server as secretary of state casts things in a new light. We have much more on the scandal below, but the political takeaway is fairly straightforward: her cloak of inevitability is torn. Whether as an actual rival or as a life raft for their party’s presidential hopes should Clinton sink herself, Democrats increasingly want and need alternatives. And so, we give you our inaugural Democratic 2016 Power Index. 1) HILLARY CLINTON","354","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/09/introducing-democratic-2016-power-index-email-flap-puts-field-in-play.html"
"Today is a perfect encapsulation of Clinton’s campaign: big resources that bring big troubles. Clinton’s controversial family foundation will be acting as an extension of her campaign as it celebrates a speech Clinton gave 20 years ago in China on women’s rights with a dense report, public events and speeches by the candidate. Of course, since the foundation funds its work partly through gifts from countries that repress women as part of official policy, it does get a little icky. She will again be appearing in public but again failing to address the email scandal beyond an impossibly Clintonian tweet on the topic. So she gets a huge boost on visibility on her central campaign theme – that it’s time for a female president – but the means by which she paid for the platform create controversy of their own. [“What I would like, is for her to come forward and say just what the situation is because she is the preeminent political figure right now. I think from this point on the silence is going to hurt her.” – Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”] 2) JOE BIDEN The vice president is kind of a hot mess. He boldly makes untrue statements. He nape-nuzzles other men’s wives in public. He’s 72, but lacks any of the campaign discipline that decades in public life ought to have brought him. And yet, he’s the single biggest threat to Hillary Clinton and the automatic frontrunner if he decides to run. Aside from having Air Force Two and near-universal name recognition, he can make the best claim to Democrats for protecting and defending President Obama’s legacy. And plus, the press loves Biden, a negative since his every gaffe would be amplified but a positive since he would have the best platform to call Clinton out. The two were consistently at odds during their time in the administration, and he would surely make a potent prosecutor of her claims of foreign policy expertise. [The Atlantic: “There’s only one prominent Democratic contender who has traveled to all three early presidential primary states so far in 2015. It’s not Hillary Clinton. Nor is it Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or even Martin O’Malley.”] 3) ELIZABETH WARREN The freshman senator from Massachusetts says she’s not running for president, but she and thousands of her supporters say they just want Hillary Clinton to move to the left and be a “progressive warrior.” But that’s an empty threat without the means to punish Clinton if she doesn’t oblige. Warren, who has had an audience with the frontrunner, has shown a reticence to run beyond coyness in recent weeks. It is helpful to appear not overly ambitious, but too much resistance will cause supporters to look elsewhere. Warren boasts the advantage of a campaign in waiting, but time is running out for her to make a long-shot run. While she might do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, to avoid being road-kill under the Clinton machine in the rest of the primaries, Warren needs to get busy. If she can get rolling, though, her zeal and authenticity could make her the Democratic heartthrob in a flash. Unlike Biden, Warren would also be a history-making nominee. [Union label - Warren and Biden both address the International Association of Firefighters today in Washington.] 4) MARTIN O’MALLEY You can’t win the game if you don’t suit up and show up, and therein lies former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley’s cardinal advantage as a candidate. Unlike the others, he is actually on the trail and looking for donors and support. O’Malley is little known and isn’t broadly identified with any particular message, but as the very liberal former governor of a very liberal state, he has many policy points to please Democrats unhappy about the idea of veering from Obama’s domestic doctrine. Campaigning in New Hampshire this weekend, O’Malley demurred when questioned about Clinton’s sketchy email account. If O’Malley wants to be more than a running-mate in waiting, he will have to draw deeper distinctions with the frontrunner to show he’s serious. 5) JIM WEBB Candidates who are running against their parties don’t usually fare well, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb looks to be no exception. Webb’s cry is that Democrats have to restore faith with the blue-collar white voters who once were the party’s backbone. And while he has a point to make about economic populism, and the deep embrace by Clinton of Wall Street, on the rest of the party’s issue set, he is a man out of time. Whether it is abortion or gun rights, Democrats made their collective choice against the party’s former base decades ago and won’t be coming back. Over the horizon - Suppose Hillary Clinton actually imploded and dropped out of the race. Who else might consider a run and could reasonably get a campaign together on the double. Some names to watch would include Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Gov. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y.

Jeb’s tougher push and the biggest threat to his overall nomination remains winning over the social conservative and libertarian wing of the party. A point that stretches beyond Iowa’s corn fields and is underlined in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which found a divide among conservative GOP primary voters with “48% saying that could see themselves backing Mr. Bush and 45% saying they couldn’t.” But the biggest concern for Bush remains the durability (so far) of conservative support for Gov. Scott Walker. To win, Bush needs conservatives divided in their loyalties and for his potential top rivals to keep pulling each other down the ladder. [Des Moines Register: “Bush did six events plus several one-on-one meetings in two markets — Des Moines and Cedar Rapids — in 24 hours. He turned some heads on Friday and Saturday, describing himself as the most successful conservative governor in Florida history and saying his record of accomplishment ‘is what's necessary right now for our country to get back on track’”] Iowa’s March Madness - National Journal provides a nifty visualization of the GOP’s 2016 field that illustrates how Iowa voters who look favorably on one candidate view the rest of the field and what this means to candidates’ strategies: “[C]andidates start out fighting to emerge as the front-runner among a smaller subgroup—in some ways like college basketball teams fighting their way through one side of a tournament bracket before the finals.

[Rick Perry’s]… messages at the Iowa Ag Summit were occasionally at odds with what some members of the audience wanted to hear… Cruz, a Republican, was the most blunt when [Iowa ethanol mogul Bruce Rastetter] asked him about the Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets a minimum amount of biofuels that must be blended into the gasoline supply. ‘The answer you’d like to me to give is I’m for the RFS,’ Cruz told Rastetter. ‘That’d be a pretty easy thing to do.’ But Cruz, who has called for phasing out the RFS program over five years, said Americans are fed up with ‘career politicians’ who pander to voters, especially in places like Iowa, with its outsized role in the presidential nominating process. Perry was equally unapologetic for his opposition to the RFS, saying he has no regrets about unsuccessfully seeking a federal waiver from the mandate as governor during a corn-sapping drought a few years ago in Texas.” Kentucky GOP gives OK to Rand’s caucus plan - AP: “Kentucky Sen.

The solar cells recharge four lithium polymer batteries.

Did you commute to work in the dark again? Not surprising since the government mandated that you wake up an hour earlier this morning (and every day until Nov. 1). The rationale for the creation and expansion of Daylight Savings Time was to save energy. The original idea was said to be Ben Franklin’s, but it became part of the mainstream American experience under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Wilson famously tried to keep the regime in place after the war, but Congress overruled him, even overriding his veto. The practice returned during World War II and was maintained by some local governments after the war. The time-shifters fought and won a long battle, eventually pushing through legislation in 1966 that required states to adopt uniform standards and gave the federal government authority over starting and stopping Daylight Savings Time. Today, every state except Arizona and Hawaii obeys. But does it work? Nope. WaPo passes along a study from time-zone-crazy Indiana that revealed that the shift wastes energy. Why? Because whatever electricity people are saving by having more sunlight in the evening is outstripped by the energy used for heating in the chillier, earlier mornings and cooling in the evening.

If Price added the defense money in committee, the budget would die there. Fiscal conservatives could have detonated Price’s entire budget, barring it from coming to the floor.

"The budget process includes a very special set of provisions called “reconciliation instructions.” Reconciliation is unique parliamentary process that resides in the budget world.

"“Reconciliation” limits debate and amendments. It also entails a simple majority to adopt an item.

"In other words, how can the House adopt a budget that is purportedly balanced, yet simultaneously move a doc fix which piles on additional debt? Price’s advocates argue there are other budgetary cost-savings which help cover the cost of the doc fix as well as additional expenditures.

"Democrats won’t assist Republicans on the budget. But the bipartisan talks led by Boehner, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and a host of other key players, appears to have forged a compromise. It could ensure Medicare reimbursements and sidestep a health and economic calamity. Democrats are expected to cover a substantial number of Republican “noes” on the doc fix, perhaps ushering that plan to passage.","595","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/22/week-that-could-break-house-balanced-budget-and-medicare-doc-fix.html"
"“There was an opportunity that presented itself to work in a bipartisan way to find the appropriate spending offsets. The door opened and I decided to walk in,” Boehner said.","596","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/22/week-that-could-break-house-balanced-budget-and-medicare-doc-fix.html"
"It’s far from done, but most bipartisan sources think the doc fix is in better shape than the budget. Last year, Republicans engineered a controversial tactic to approve the doc fix. Without telling members what was afoot, the House slyly adopted a year-long doc fix patch without full roll call vote, sliding the measure through before anyone even knew what was going on.","597","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/22/week-that-could-break-house-balanced-budget-and-medicare-doc-fix.html"

"However, at least that parliamentary contrivance worked. There’s anything but certainty in the coming days. The doc fix remains a challenging vote. Who wants to vote against seniors from getting treatment under Medicare? And who wants to further explode the deficit?","599","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/22/week-that-could-break-house-balanced-budget-and-medicare-doc-fix.html"
"The coming week is a good glance at how Boehner and his leadership team might operate for the rest of this Congress. On one hand, Boehner faces a test at holding Republicans together on a partisan effort like the budget. On the other, the doc fix unveils a frontier in coalition building. If successful, the development of bipartisan coalitions could help fund highway programs, raise the debt limit and keep the federal government operating this fall. Success could telegraph the GOP strategy for the rest of the Congress.","600","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/22/week-that-could-break-house-balanced-budget-and-medicare-doc-fix.html"

"Hillary Clinton launched her campaign for president over two weeks ago, and there remain three major unanswered questions about her latest bid for the presidency:","Published April 28, 2015","625","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"1. Why is Hillary Clinton running for president, and what policies would she pursue if elected?","626","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"Pundits across the political spectrum have mocked the lack of a rationale for Clinton’s candidacy. Is she running for president because it’s “her turn,” because she’s the only Democrat with a truly national profile and near-universal name recognition, or because it’s the next logical thing to do in her political career? None of these are sufficient rationales for a candidacy, but in the absence of a cogent explanation from Clinton or her campaign, it’s natural for observers to make assumptions about why she’s seeking the highest office in the land.","627","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"A related problem is the Clinton campaign’s failure to articulate even the broad strokes of a policy agenda that she would pursue if elected.","628","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"A presidential candidate is generally expected to articulate policy priorities at a relatively early point in his or her candidacy. In Clinton’s case, the expectations should be even higher since she has been in public life for the better part of the last two decades. Thus far, however, she and her campaign have given us no substance on which to judge her candidacy.","629","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"Vague statements about wanting to be a “champion” for “everyday Americans” don’t shed any real light on how she would grow our nation’s economy or improve our nation’s standing in the world. The lack of a policy agenda is particularly troubling given the fact that Clinton’s record on so many significant issues has been murky at best.","630","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"2. How damaging will the business dealings of the Clinton Foundation prove to be for Hillary’s campaign?","631","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"Very damaging, if last week’s revelations in the New York Times are representative of the activity that the Clinton Foundation has engaged in during and since Clinton’s time as Secretary of State. The Times reported that the Clinton Foundation received millions in previously undisclosed donations from a Canadian mining executive who sold uranium-mining stakes in the United States, with the approval of then-Secretary of State Clinton, to the Russian atomic energy agency.","632","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"It is inconceivable that Clinton and her team did not know that these donations would be a political liability. The way they responded to the allegations was indicative of how the Clinton machine usually responds when politically problematic issues are raised against them: they attacked the messenger and sought to frame all of the revelations as part of a conservative witch-hunt. But the magnitude of the allegations, as well as the outlet that the allegations were published in, make this strategy a problematic one.","633","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"We may never know the exact nature of the relationship between donors to the Clinton Foundation (which included foreign governments) and policy made while Clinton was Secretary of State. Her unwillingness to turn over all of the private emails from her time in the Obama administration makes a full accounting of these matters unlikely. But the circumstantial evidence alone is sure to cause nightmares for Clinton and her campaign.","634","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"3. How will Hillary Clinton draw distance from the unpopular elements of President Obama’s time in office?","635","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"This is the big question that has, thus far, gone basically unanswered. Clinton has been reticent to attack President Obama or any of his policies. Her unwillingness, for example, to address how she would distance herself from the failures of Obama’s foreign policy or how she would deal with ObamaCare if elected president, raise both political and substantive concerns.","636","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"Her public statements thus far suggest that Clinton hasn’t yet figured out how to navigate the terrain between the more progressive and conservative members of her party. In that sense, she will not be immune from the kind of intraparty sniping that is sure to appear in the crowded Republican primary field over the next several months.","637","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"This ankle-biting within Democratic ranks will become even more acute when others considering presidential runs, like former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley or former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, begin to sense that there is some political gain to be had by attacking Clinton’s obfuscation on key parts of the Obama record.","638","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"Ultimately, Hillary Clinton is going to have to decide what kind of Democrat she wants to be as she seeks the presidency. And that’s a choice that she hasn’t exhibited an interest in making thus far.","639","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"

"The No. 2 official at the Homeland Security Department improperly intervened on behalf of foreign investors seeking U.S. visas in three cases involving prominent Democrats, including a company run by the youngest brother of likely Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the agency's inspector general said Tuesday.","Published March 24, 2015","641","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"Investigators said Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas helped efforts to secure the visas in ways that created the appearance of favoritism and special access and caused resentment among career government employees, managers and lawyers.","642","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"The agency's inspector general, John Roth, said he could not suggest a motive for Mayorkas, a longtime Democrat who served on President Barack Obama's transition team after his 2008 election and was U.S. attorney in California under President Bill Clinton. Roth did not accuse Mayorkas of violating any laws and acknowledged that Mayorkas sometimes declined to become involved in cases because he said he did not think it would be appropriate.","643","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"Mayorkas, who at the time was head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a statement that he disagreed with the inspector general's findings but that ""I will certainly learn from it and from this process.""","644","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"Mayorkas added: ""There was erroneous decision-making and insufficient security vetting of cases. I could not and did not turn my back on my responsibility to address those grave problems. I made improving the program a priority and I did so in a hands-on manner.""","645","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"The U.S. government's investor-visa program, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to obtain visas to live permanently in the U.S. with their spouse and children if they invest $500,000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for American citizens. Approved investors can become legal permanent residents after two years and later can become U.S. citizens.","646","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said the findings were ""extremely concerning"" and that he will conduct a congressional hearing about them Thursday. Roth was expected to testify.","647","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"The Associated Press first reported in July 2013 — as Mayorkas was being considered for the No. 2 job at the Homeland Security Department — allegations that he had improperly intervened in the investor case involving a financing company run by Anthony Rodham, brother of Mrs. Clinton. Mayorkas told senators at his confirmation hearing that the allegations were ""unequivocally false"" and said he oversaw the program ""based on the law and the facts, and nothing else.""","648","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"The inspector general's new conclusions also cast doubt on whether the Homeland Security Department withheld embarrassing internal files the AP had sought under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act as part of its own investigation nearly two years ago — and instead released records that indicated no wrongdoing.","649","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"The AP in July 2013 requested all emails to or from Mayorkas over the preceding seven months that contained specific words or names, including Rodham. The government eventually sent AP more than 200 pages, mostly censored, including emails in which Mayorkas told investors and agency staff that he would not become involved in internal deliberations.","650","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"""I cannot weigh in,"" Mayorkas wrote to Assistant Secretary Douglas Smith on Feb. 1, 2013, in a message turned over to the AP and cited in the new inspector general's report. ""The (investor's) attorney sent an email to me and I responded that I could not weigh in.""","651","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"But the inspector general's report also cited other messages from Mayorkas that were never turned over to AP. In one case, Mayorkas forwarded a January 2013 email from Rodham about delays with a high importance designation. The email would have been covered under AP's information request since Mayorkas sent it during the relevant time period and contained Rodham's name.","652","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"""Staff understood these applications were getting high-level attention,"" the inspector general's report said.","653","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was also connected to the investor proposal but later divested. His spokesman, Brian Coy, said the report demonstrated that McAuliffe asked the government to decide on the investment proposal in a timely fashion.","654","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"The other two cases involved a Hollywood investment program and an investment effort in Nevada that had ties to former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, respectively.","655","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"In the effort to reach Mayorkas about the Hollywood investment, Tom Rosenfeld, the principal in the Los Angeles Film Center project, contacted John Emerson, an influential Los Angeles attorney who was also a top Obama political bundler. The report, which describes Emerson as a ""career adviser"" for Mayorkas, said Emerson contacted Mayorkas several times by email in August 2011 about the petitions for the film project. Emerson, a Democratic Party donor who pledged to collect more than $500,000 from others to aid Obama's 2012 presidential campaign, is now U.S. ambassador to Germany.","656","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"In September 2011, Mayorkas replied to Emerson by email, saying he was not involved. But the inspector general said it found records of three phone conversations the same evening between Emerson and Mayorkas' personal cellphone. Mayorkas told investigators he did not discuss the film project case with Emerson, adding that they might have spoken because he was on a board with Emerson's wife. The inspector general noted that Mayorkas had previously told an agency ethics officer that he had given up all positions outside the federal government.","657","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"Mayorkas previously came under criticism for his involvement in the commutation by President Clinton of the prison sentence of the son of a Democratic Party donor. Another of Mrs. Clinton's brothers, Hugh Rodham, had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. Mayorkas told lawmakers during his 2009 confirmation hearing that it was a mistake to talk to the White House about the request.","658","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said there were lessons to be learned in the inspector general's investigation but described Mayorkas in a statement as ""exceptionally conscientious, honest and patriotic.""","659","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"""He is often impatient with our sluggish government bureaucracy, can at times be very hands-on in resolving issues and problems that are brought to his personal attention, and is always mindful that we are public servants,"" Johnson said. ""Ali works hard to do the right thing, and never acts, in my observation, for reasons of personal advancement or aggrandizement.""","660","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"
"Roth, the inspector general, praised as ""courageous"" the agency employees who confidentially had complained about Mayorkas' actions and promised they would be protected as whistleblowers.","661","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/24/report-homeland-security-official-used-improper-influence.html"

"Buzz Cut: • Dem revolt begins on Obama amnesty • Hillary re-emerges for event with corporate backers • Baier Tracks: ‘Getting to yes’ on Iran nukes • Gotcha: Walker rips media ‘nonsense’ • A pipe packed with sea cows","666","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/24/dem-revolt-begins-on-obama-amnesty.html"
"DEM REVOLT BEGINS ON OBAMA AMNESTY After maintaining a weeks-long filibuster of a Republican bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security but roll back president Obama’s executive actions granting amnesty and work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, Senate Democrats are starting to splinter. Unable to break the Democratic logjam, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he would instead offer a standalone bill to block Obama’s amnesty gambit before resuming the funding fight. Appearing on “Fox & Friends,” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he would vote to “prevent the president from his executive action” and suggested that there might be the five other Democrats necessary to advance the legislation. “Well, this bill removes those excuses. It sets up a simple political equation: Either stand in defense of extreme overreach, or stand with constituents in support of shared democratic values.” –Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell in a floor speech today. Tick-tock - While Obama would almost certainly veto the bill, significant Democratic objections to his policies combined with the federal court ruling against the administration on the actions could start to shift the debate. The president will prove today that he doesn’t mind vetoing popular, bipartisan legislation as he spikes the bill approving an oil pipeline from Canada, but if there is a Democratic rebellion it is harder to argue that he is doing the will of the people. Plus, getting Democrats on the record as protecting the amnesty is always helpful to the GOP. But big questions remain. Can the House and Senate cough up an emergency, stopgap spending plan to keep the agency running while the debate plays out? The deadline is Friday and time is running out quickly. “The American people are demanding more than that and seeing through these antics which are designed to protect the president in his lawlessness in defiance of a constitutional system.” –Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, on “The Kelly File” Watch here. IN SLAP TO UNIONS, OBAMA TO CAN BIPARTISAN KEYSTONE BILL Fox News: “The Senate will send the Keystone XL pipeline bill to President Obama on Tuesday, senior congressional sources tell Fox News. … The House passed a final version of the bill about two weeks ago, but the sources told Fox New that leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress intentionally waited to send it to the White House. They purportedly wanted Congress, which last week was on break, to be in session if and when the president vetoes the bill so they can draw more attention to the issue.”","667","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/24/dem-revolt-begins-on-obama-amnesty.html"
"“The White House’s recommendation of a veto has nothing to do with the aforementioned merits of the project. Instead, the administration claims the bill will ‘cut short’ the process for approving the project. We disagree. If anything, the process has been needlessly drawn out: more than 2,300 days have passed since the Keystone application was first filed. This level of delay is extreme, even for Washington. In fact, approving these types of pipelines was once routine.” –Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. in a USA Today op-ed. Hangover for Hillary – What does Hillary Clinton think about the pipeline project? She was seemingly for it before she went silent. In 2012, as her boss buoyed the green base with a further delay, one pipeline opponent observed: “She doubtless figures four years is a long time, and – even though it’s the one environmental issue in decades that’s brought big crowds of environmentalists into the streets – that voters will forget her stance on the pipeline.” But those years have come and gone and the issue is still alive, thanks to the president’s obduracy. Given the support the Clinton Foundation has reportedly received from Keystone proponents, greenies will demand answers from the presumptive Democratic nominee. That was then - “We’ve not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so…” –Hillary Clinton in a 2010 speech. This is now - “We have differences and you won't get me to talk about Keystone because I have steadily made clear that I'm not going to express an opinion. It is in our process and that’s where it belongs.” –Hillary Clinton to an audience in Canada on January, 21 2015.","668","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/24/dem-revolt-begins-on-obama-amnesty.html"
"HILLARY RE-EMERGES FOR EVENT WITH CORPORATE BACKERS After not appearing before an American audience in more than two months and with questions swirling about foreign donations to her family foundation, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is back on the speaking circuit today. She’s on stage for a Silicon Valley gig touting the gender equality policies of some of her most influential corporate patrons. McClatchy: “Clinton will serve as the keynote speaker [today] at a conference sponsored by a series of major companies that have donated to her political campaigns or her family’s foundation, helped pay her hefty speaking fees at other events and lobbied her when she served as secretary of state. Some of their employees have been involved in her campaigns or initiatives at the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Many have multiple ties to the Clintons. “Cisco, a California networking-equipment company, donated thousands of dollars to Clinton through its political action committee, and its general counsel served as a bundler and a policy adviser for her 2008 presidential campaign. Ericsson, a Swedish communications company, donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the foundation, and its president participated in a group discussion at the related Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting last year. Morgan Stanley, a New York investment firm that’s Clinton’s sixth largest donor, spent at least $14 million lobbying the federal government, including the State Department, during her term on issues related to China, India and currency-exchange oversight, according to public records.” [WaPo: “For Clinton, the Bay Area represents perhaps her biggest opportunity to expand her fundraising base from 2008, when she raised $6.2 million from the affluent counties of San Francisco, Santa Clara and San Mateo, according to campaign finance data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Obama brought in $9.8 million from donors in those counties during the same time period.”] Campaign motif will be gender war – National Journal: “Already, recent words and actions hint at the ways [Hillary Clinton will] bring gender into the 2016 campaign—by talking about issues like pay equity, affordable child care, and paid family leave, referencing her past work for women and children, and gushing about her new granddaughter. That soft approach will be coupled with a sharp-edged assault by supporting organizations outside of her camp. Some of them, including the abortion-rights group EMILY's List and the Democratic National Committee, have begun playing offense against the Republican field, painting many of the 2016 GOP hopefuls as anti-woman.” BAIER TRACKS: ‘GETTING TO YES’ ON IRAN NUKES… “As more and more details are starting to leak out about a possible U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, an increasing number of U.S. allies appear to be getting very nervous. Israelis, for obvious reasons, are the most concerned. So much so that the conventional wisdom that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would see serious political backlash for speaking to the U.S. Congress about Iran without a White House blessing is being turned around completely. Some Israeli pundits and commentators even called for Netanyahu’s opponent in the upcoming election, Isaac Herzog, to stand alongside the prime minster when he addresses Congress. Herzog declined, but the conversation itself is a sign of the shifting Israeli politics on the issue. The structure of the deal is being dramatically reframed by the Obama administration. As Bloomberg reports, gone is the idea of a grand bargain that would empower moderates and lead to lasting change in Iran’s leadership. This now appears to be just a temporary arms deal that could leave Iran at the brink of having nuclear weapon. That prospect looks different, though, after reading this piece from the Weekly Standard that lays out details of the funding of Al Qaeda operations. It is no wonder that Israel and Gulf State nations are worried. In a remarkable switch, these allies seem to be hoping for the ayatollah in Tehran to have a change of heart and turn the deal down. Because at this point, it seems the Obama administration is trying extremely hard to – in the president’s words – ‘get to yes.’” - Bret Baier. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... The Atlantic examines the phenomenon of how the body registers effects of capsaicin, the active chemical in chilies that causes the burning sensation through a pain receptor, TRPV1. Receptors are found throughout the body, researcher John Hayes, said, and “This is why when you chop chilies, and then rub your eyes, or use the bathroom, without washing your hands, you are in for a world of hurt.” Though it feels like a burn, there isn’t an actual burn occurring, but rather a chemical evolution, “The chili pepper evolved a chemical that fits into that molecular receptor [TRPV1] and lowers the activation energy from 43 [degrees] Celsius to about 34 [degrees] Celsius,” he said. Hayes and fellow researcher Nadia Byrnes, both agree that it is possible to increase tolerance through repeated exposures, particularly at young ages. “Basically, if you don’t like something, the more you eat of it, the more you’ll like it,” Byrnes said.

Much earlier than usual, potential candidates, operatives and donors are maneuvering for advantage here. The urgency comes from Texas' moving its election from the end of the primary calendar toward the beginning. Which, for Republicans, changes everything. Already, would-be presidential hopeful and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has recruited the state's Republican Party chairman to handle communication strategies. “Former Gov. Rick Perry is enlisting powerful Texas donors to prove he’s serious about 2016, notwithstanding his flame-out three years ago. New Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush is stepping forward as a more prominent conservative voice as his father Jeb readies a run, and Sen. Ted Cruz is building a broader fundraising apparatus. Texas’ plan to hold its 2016 primary on March 1 means that only the traditional two early voting states, along with South Carolina and Nevada, would predate it, though some other states may eventually move their primaries up too. In 2012, Texas' primary came in late May, when the GOP race was already settled.” Howdy, hipsters - 2016 contender Sen. Rand Paul is slated to appear at the Austin’s South by Southwest music festival in mid-March. SXSW Interactive: “Paul joins Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith for a special interview at SXSW.

Neither Mr. Rubio nor Mr. Adelson’s team would comment on what the two men had discussed.) At a seminar last month hosted by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H.

Chris Christie will unveil what he says is a deal with the state teachers union to plug a $1.57 billion budget hole and address the state’s long-term budget woes. In a preview of the speech provided to Fox News First by Christie’s team, the 2016 hopeful will announce that the state’s independent Pension and Health Benefit Study Commission has reached a deal with the New Jersey Education Association to find “a sustainable, long-term solution to the pension problem.” This is significant for Christie since the union bitterly opposed his 2011 budget package. In an excerpt provided by Team Christie, the governor uses the deal to highlight his work as a bipartisan dealmaker: “We do it differently. We get it done. I am committed to working with each and every one of you in good faith to make a promise to the people of this state that we will not push this off…we will not leave it for another day…for another year…for another generation.” [Tune in - You can watch the Christie address live at 2 pm ET.

"WASHINGTON – California Democrats are trying to reverse a decades-old state law that bars families from getting extra welfare money for having an additional child, describing the law as ""sexist"" and ""classist"" -- despite concerns that repealing it could compound the state's money woes.","Published February 26, 2015","750","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/26/california-lawmakers-push-to-repeal-welfare-queen-law.html"

"Democrats are still in charge, but support for the law may be fading. State Sen. Holly Mitchell, as reported in the Sacramento Bee, recently introduced a bill that would repeal the policy, which she says was initially engineered to discourage welfare recipients from having additional children. The problem, she argues, is that it didn’t work.","752","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/26/california-lawmakers-push-to-repeal-welfare-queen-law.html"

"Whitaker, in making the case that Catalist is not a corporation but in fact a political group subject to campaign finance law, said the organization is funded by and caters to donors and groups responsible for over $100 million in outside spending to elect Democrats.

"Federal parties were completely banned from raising and spending ""soft money"" in 2004. PACs and other groups like 527s can still raise unlimited amounts of soft money, but they cannot coordinate directly with campaigns or political parties. Whitaker says as a “corporation,” Catalist investors and clients can engage in “seamless coordination” and other activities that PACs, 527s and parties cannot. In addition, wealthy donors like Soros, who has invested millions in Catalist since 2006, are not subject to FEC disclosure laws.","793","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/20/complaint-democrats-skirting-fec-laws-with-private-company.html"

"The deal that had been taking shape would see Iran freeze its nuclear program for at least a decade, with restrictions then gradually lifted over a period of perhaps the following five years.

"Buzz Cut: • Hillary lets Dems twist on her email scandal • Clintons count on cowed, complicit press • Can Jeb do Iowa? • Perry super PAC launches • They don’t cover pre-existing conditions","905","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/06/hillary-lets-dems-twist-on-her-email-scandal.html"
"HILLARY LETS DEMS TWIST ON HER EMAIL SCANDAL Democrats are having plenty of Ralph Kramden moments when asked about Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. If anything frightens lawmakers more than 4 inches of snow, it is the prospect of getting crossways with Clinton’s communications cutthroats. But they’re not giving Democrats much to work with here. Lashing out at the NYT and trying to shift the blame to the Obama administration is not exactly putting Hill Democrats in their sweet spot. And when the subject – lack of transparency and ethical concerns – goes to the heart of the party’s misgivings about its presumptive nominee, it’s that much tougher. [Literally? – “I literally don’t know anything about her home internet system.” – Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., when asked about the scandal by National Journal.] While the party will eventually unite (mostly) behind Clinton, seeking to defend her from the “vast right wing conspiracy” she will blame for this debacle, this will leave a stain. The subtle shift in thinking that may be the most consequential is this: Once Democrats wondered if they needed a primary challenger to Hillary to get her to move left and to tune her up for the general. Now they wonder if one won’t be necessary in case Hillary blows up like the Death Star. That shift opens the door for potential challengers, particularly Biden and O’Malley to make a case for their candidacies that is not explicitly ideological, but a practical consideration for the party. For Liz Warren, meanwhile, the moment may be growing nearer when she could deliver what is the single gravest threat to the Clintons’ effort to return to power. Just in case you ever need them… - Vice President Joe Biden will address gay rights activists tonight in Washington D.C. and Former Gov. Martin O’Malley, D-Md., is set to spend the weekend in New Hampshire, delivering a keynote address tonight at a fundraiser for the Merrimack County Democratic Committee and the Concord City Democrats. On Saturday, he will appear at a fundraiser for the New Hampshire Democratic Party and later will deliver the keynote address at the Washington Days banquet in Topeka, Kansas. Use discredit to discredit - Jackie Kucinich and Tim Mak report on how Democrats are using the new revelations about Clinton’s secret email server to attack the House committee charged with unraveling the causes and cover-up of the 2012 Islamist raid on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. [NYT: “‘It’s a ball of wool that won’t go away until the questions are answered,’ said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.”] CLINTONS COUNT ON COWED, COMPLICIT PRESS How does Hillary Clinton think that she will get away with blowing off reporters even as she attends public events that are part of her still-unregistered presidential campaign, including a weekend shindig for her controversial family foundation? Or even more overtly political events and not answer for a mounting list of questions about her decision to evade federal rules about her emails as Secretary of State? She is counting on a complicit press. And she is likely to be largely obliged. Walls of stone - Jennifer Epstein gives us a valuable view from the Clinton war room: “The hope of Clinton’s inner circle is that she’ll be able to address the e-mail controversy as a minor element of her expected announcement. Agreeing to an interview now or at any time before she’s ready to launch her campaign would be potentially detrimental, signaling that she’s shifted into damage control mode and drawing attention to an issue about which many voters are still unaware, said a former Clinton campaign aide who has knowledge of the current team’s thinking. It would also appear to challenge her aides’ assertions that she did nothing wrong.” Royal treatment - Peggy Noonan, never more indispensable than in moments like these, explains why some in the press are going knock-kneed: With the exception of the moment Wednesday when a hardy reporter from TMZ actually went to an airport and shouted a query at Mrs. Clinton—it was just like the old days of journalism, with a stakeout and shouted queries—Mrs. Clinton hasn’t been subjected to any questions from the press. She’s slide, she’ll glide, she’ll skate. (With TMZ she just walked on, smiling.) … Why doesn’t the legacy press swarm her on this? Because she is political royalty. They are used to seeing her as a regal, queenly figure. They’ve been habituated to understand that Mrs. Clinton is not to be harried, not to be subjected to gotcha questions or impertinent grilling. She is a Democrat, a star, not some grubby Republican governor from nowhere. And they don’t want to be muscled by her spokesmen.” [Fox News: “Hillary Clinton appears to have established multiple email addresses for her private use, and possibly the use of her aides, under the domain of ‘clintonemail.com,’ according to a prominent member of the hacking community who supplied independent research data, conducted with high-tech tools, to Fox News.”] Downtrend - In the latest Fox News poll, taken just before the email scandal broke, found that 61 percent of voters thought the foreign donations to Clinton’s family foundation represented a conflict of interest. Only 44 percent of respondents said they would describe Hillary as honest, down 10 points from last year and just 1 point better than President Obama. Power Play: Did you have to let it linger? - Hillary Clinton’s decision to use private email as Secretary of State is raising major questions about her secrecy and accountability. Brad Blakeman, former George W. Bush adviser and radio host Garland Nixon join Chris Stirewalt ponder whether this scandal will stick and end Clinton’s prospects for a White House bid. WATCH HERE. [What if Clinton crumbles? Blakeman and Nixon flesh out the possibilities. WATCH HERE.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... The Motown hit, “My Girl” became The Temptations’ first number one hit on this day 50 years ago. Written by Smokey Robinson and Ronald White, this was the first all-male group to have a number one Motown. In this previous interview with WSJ, Robinson provides some insight into the song’s origins, saying, “I didn’t set out to write ‘My Girl’ for the Miracles and me to record. My wife at the time wasn’t the inspiration, either…I wrote ‘My Girl’ in 1964 specifically for the Temptations, with hopes they would make it a hit.” Wanting to do something different, Robinson focused on composing a song with David Ruffin in the lead role rather than Eddie Kendricks. He had key and chord changes in mind and the melody simply came after that. The single was quickly released and a few months later, Berry Gordy, Motown’s owner, gave Robinson a $1,000 bonus check saying, “You’ve got a number one record coming.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

As top 2016 contender Jeb Bush makes his first foray into Iowa today, a big question looms: Can he block conservative challenger, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker? The former Florida governor will be starting on friendly turf as he courts members of a trade group looking to preserve ethanol subsidies, but how will he fare with the social and small government conservatives who dominate the state? As the latest Fox News poll shows, the Bush name provides an advantage over lesser known rivals. And while Jeb will score points with ethanol enthusiasts like Gov. Terry Branstad, his moderate views don’t sit well with Iowa’s conservative caucus goers. [Jeb Bush will appear at a fundraiser tonight for Rep. David Young, R-Iowa in Urbandale, Iowa] Needs a base crack up - If Walker can hold his spot as the consensus conservative choice, a posture which won him a 15-point advantage in the Quinnipiac Iowa poll out this week, Bush could be frozen out of the nomination. One way for Jeb to achieve a breakout would be the approach his brother used in 2000 to win Iowa: Appeal to the social conservatives who are less concerned about issues that trouble other activists on the right, particularly immigration, and who share Bush’s opposition to abortion and fervent faith. If Bush can peel off enough of those caucus goers to add to his moderate, pro-business coalition, he could emerge ahead of a crowded field for an Iowa win. [Hawkeye happenings - The Iowa Agriculture Summit is set to kick off Saturday at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines with numerous presidential contenders scheduled to appear including former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., former Gov. George Pataki, R-N.Y., former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., businessman Donald Trump and Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis.] “[Jeb Bush] reminds me of the man who grumbles about his old-fashioned and boring Episcopalian church, but can’t bring himself to leave because his great-grandfather donated the church bell, and his mother was buried in the graveyard.” – Cary Gordon, a Christian conservative pastor at a Sioux City church talking to The Des Moines Register about why Bush is still a Republican. [The AEI World Forum in Sea Island, Georgia continues. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas and former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., are slated to speak today with Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., Governor Bobby Jindal, R-La., and Governor Mike Pence, R-Ind. scheduled for Saturday.] Rubio’s wealthy backers make big bets - WaPo: “Jeb Bush’s success in rounding up GOP donors as he pursues a likely presidential run has created a big question for his fellow Floridian Marco Rubio: Will there be any money left for him? That’s where Norman Braman comes in. The billionaire Miami auto dealer and longtime Rubio benefactor is expected to put as much as $10 million into a pro-Rubio super PAC if the senator decides to run, according to people familiar with his plans. ‘If there is a super PAC that’s founded, I will give substantially,’ Braman said in an interview, declining to be more specific. ‘I don’t pay any attention to that other distinguished Floridian,’ he added, referring to the former governor…Support from Braman, a former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles football team, is exactly what the 43-year-old first-term senator needs…” Rand bagged ‘Parks and Recreation’ cameo - The Hill: “Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) turned down a cameo on the NBC television show ‘Parks and Recreation’ at the last minute, its co-creator said in an interview published Wednesday. ‘We also wanted Rand Paul to be in the Washington episode, and he agreed, but then bailed at the eleventh hour,’ Mike Schur said in a conversation with HitFix. ‘I think he thought we were making fun of him, or something, which we were not, at all. We were in fact flattering him, by linking him to Ron. I get the sense that maybe interpreting writing and humor is not his strong suit.’” [Watch Fox: Sen.

Rick Perry readies a second presidential campaign his supporters have created a super PAC devoted to his 2016 ambitions. A handful of former aides and allies on Thursday launched the Opportunity and Freedom PAC, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on Perry's behalf. ‘We want to focus on introducing Rick Perry to the voters of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - and throughout the country,’ Austin Barbour, a senior adviser for the new organization, said in an interview with The Associated Press. ‘I don't think when he ran in `11 and `12 many people got a chance to truly understand his background. He's got an incredible story to tell.’” Pro-Hillary group leader on Christie: ‘We want to kill him dead’ - Daily Caller: “The president of a Democrat super PAC dedicated to digging up opposition research on Republicans said of New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie: ‘We want to kill him dead.’ Brad Woodhouse, the president of the liberal super PAC American Bridge, made the provocative comments in a profile of the organization published by Bloomberg Politics. The story notes that American Bridge would not back off its attacks on Christie. ‘We’re not going to pull resources from Christie,’ Woodhouse told the outlet. ‘We want to kill him dead.’ Woodhouse, a longtime Democratic operative, has often accused Republicans of using offensive rhetoric against President Obama.

THEY DON’T COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AP: “Authorities say a Pennsylvania man called an insurance company from a crash scene to buy auto coverage and later claimed his wreck happened after he got the policy. The Altoona Mirror reports that the insurance fraud charges filed this week against 33-year-old Michael Traveny stem from an Aug. 21 crash in Duncansville. State prosecutors say Traveny didn’t have insurance when he crashed that night so he called Safe Auto Insurance from the scene and purchased coverage without mentioning the wreck. Prosecutors say Traveny filed a $3,900 claim the next day claiming the crash happened after the policy took effect. Online court records don’t list an attorney for Traveny. He faces a preliminary hearing March 17.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is not a new story, and that’s the reason why the Democrats are so dismayed…she’s a Clinton and what the Clintons do is never clear the air.

He got a boost earlier this week, when the Miami Herald reported that former Miami mayor and Clinton backer Manny Diaz vowed to back O'Malley if he ran.","1017","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"
"While O'Malley enjoys his moment in the spotlight, Clinton has been inundated by numerous reports that the Clinton Foundation had accepted millions of dollars of foreign donations before, during and after she was secretary of state. Some of those contributions were underreported or not reported at all. A forthcoming book is expected to detail benefits donors allegedly received. This follows several weeks of questions over her private email account and server, which she used to conduct the business of secretary of state.","1018","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"

"But O’Malley has managed to stay front and center. He traveled to Iowa in early April, where he talked to reporters about an “alternative choice” and a “contest of ideas,” along with his thoughts on how Republicans’ “trickle-down economics” are wrong for the country. This weekend, according to his spokeswoman Haley Morris, he will be in another key primary state, South Carolina, and then in New Hampshire on May 13.","1021","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"
"In an appearance and subsequent interviews with reporters at Harvard University, O’Malley, who also served as mayor of Baltimore from 1999-2007, said he would like to see the federal minimum wage raised to $15 (he increased the Maryland wage to $10.10 when he was governor).","1022","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"
"More recently, O’Malley spoke out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement, an issue that puts him in the corner of the labor unions, but which Clinton supported during her tenure as secretary of state. He tweeted out this campaign-style video, establishing his position on the issue.","1023","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"
"Without naming Clinton directly, he also took a jab at “leaders” who aren’t clear where they stand. “American workers whose jobs are on the line right now are owed more than lip service,” he wrote to supporters in an email, according to Washington Post columnist Chris Cillizza. “They deserve to know where their leaders stand.”","1024","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"
"O’Malley also was asked about the former secretary of state’s position on gay marriage – she now believes it is a constitutional right after last year saying it was up to the states to decide – by The Guardian during his recent trip to Boston (the Clinton camp has said her responses have not changed – she’s just been asked “different questions” on the issue).","1025","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"

"Yvette Lewis, a former chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party and O’Malley supporter, told FoxNews.com he is not about “being against” anyone, but about what he is for, and that is making the country better.","1027","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"
"“What he is doing is listening, going to various communities, talking to people and putting his hand on the pulse of what people are feeling,” she said.

"“The media likes a good story,” she said. “He’s not against anything. If he is running, it’ll definitely be on what he is for. And he is for a good quality of life and the issues people care about. It won’t be against one person.”","1029","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"

"“I think honestly, the best [O’Malley] can do is not so much tout his own record as governor, but point out the shortcomings of Hillary and hope that sticks,” he told FoxNews.com. “He’s been getting progressively bolder on that, and more critical.”","1033","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"
"O’Malley could be positioning himself as a vice presidential pick if Hillary should get the nomination, but even there, he doesn’t add much to the bill, being from a solidly blue state, said Dan Gerstein, a political analyst and former Democratic strategist.","1034","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/democrat-omalley-spotlight-as-clinton-under-scrutiny.html"

"Embattled Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber faced stiff pressure from top-ranking fellow Democrats to resign on Thursday, shortly after the state's No. 2 official issued a statement describing the governor's recent behavior as ""strange"" and contradictory.","Published February 13, 2015","1047","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"
"The latest calls to resign -- in the wake of influence-peddling allegations involving his fiancee Cylvia Hayes, a green-energy consultant -- came from the upper echelons of Oregon's government. Senate President Peter Courtney told reporters Thursday afternoon that he and House Speaker Tina Kotek have asked for Kitzhaber to step down.","1048","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"

"His remarks came after Secretary of State Kate Brown, who would be in line to succeed Kitzhaber should he step down, issued a statement calling this a ""bizarre and unprecedented situation.""","1050","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"
"Brown had been summoned back to Oregon by the governor on Wednesday while she was attending a conference in Washington. Her abrupt return to Oregon fueled speculation that the governor was planning to resign.","1051","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"
"Sources told The Associated Press that, in fact, he had decided to step down amid the ethics controversy involving his fiancée but changed his mind while Brown was en route back to Oregon.","1052","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"

"She said she first heard from the governor late Tuesday afternoon. ""He asked me to come back to Oregon as soon as possible to speak with him in person and alone,"" Brown said.","1054","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"
"But when she arrived for the meeting with the governor on Wednesday, Brown said, ""He asked me why I came back early from Washington, D.C., which I found strange.""","1055","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"

"Pressure to do so grew significantly on Thursday. The state treasurer also joined in the call for Kitzhaber to step down. ""Unfortunately, the current situation has become untenable, and I cannot imagine any scenario by which things improve,"" said Treasurer Ted Wheeler, another Democrat. ""Oregon deserves a governor who is fully focused on the duties of state.""","1058","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"

"It's not clear why Kitzhaber, a four-term governor who handily won re-election in November, decided he would stay put despite the mounting criticism.

"Newspaper editorial boards and Republicans have called on him to leave office over allegations involving his fiancee, who has been under increasing scrutiny since October, when a series of reports chronicled her work for organizations with an interest in Oregon public policy. That work came about when she was serving as an unpaid adviser in the governor's office.","1062","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"

"Kitzhaber has denied any wrongdoing, saying he and Hayes took steps to avoid conflicts of interest. Though questions about Hayes have swirled for months, the pressure on Kitzhaber intensified in recent weeks after newspapers raised questions about whether Hayes reported all her income to on her tax returns.","1064","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/dems-urge-oregon-governor-to-resign-top-official-reveals-strange-behavior.html"

"Again, that’s what’s likely to happen. Schumer quickly maneuvered to lock down his votes as Reid’s successor within hours of the Nevada Democrat’s announcement last Friday. What isn’t as clear is what happens down-ballot. It’s thought that Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wants to maintain his post as the number two. But there is rattling that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., may want to springboard deeper into leadership. And, then there is the wild card: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. There are outside efforts to court Warren to run for one of the top spots in the Senate. And there are those who want the Massachusetts Democrat to run for president – regardless of whether Hillary Clinton seeks the White House.","1073","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"Warren isn’t yet running for anything, including an upgrade from her lower-level Democratic leadership position in the Senate. She said as much during a recent appearance on NBC. Durbin and Murray are friends and it’s unclear if there could be a challenge there, too, or if they could reach an agreement.","1074","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"But there will be forces in Democratic politics who will push for diversity on the front line in the Senate. Never before has a woman held one of the two leadership posts in the Senate in either party. They’ll argue that a party that purports to advocate for women needs to show some representation at the top. Current House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., broke that glass ceiling when she became the House minority whip in 2001 (later speaker) and is the only female to ever serve in the upper echelon of leadership in either body.","1075","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"The conversation about Pelosi brings us to an interesting leadership nexus about the future of Democratic leaders not just in the Senate, but in the House of Representatives, too.","1076","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"Pelosi has been the top Democrat in the House for 13 years now. That’s a remarkable run. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., has been the number two since 2003, either as whip or as majority leader. Assistant Minority Leader Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., has been the number two or three since 2003 (he was the whip when Democrats held the majority). All are in their mid-70s … and no one appears to be going anywhere anytime soon.","1077","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"After losing control of the House in 2010 and failing to regain the House after the 2012 and 2014 elections, many political observers thought Pelosi was out the door.

"The conjecture always swirled. If Pelosi left, would Hoyer earn the promotion he’s sought for so long? Would Pelosi deploy her considerable political muscle to block Hoyer? Would she anoint a successor? One forgets that Pelosi and Hoyer are natural rivals. Both hail from Maryland and her father was a congressman from Baltimore. The Pelosi/Hoyer connection dates back to the 1960s when they worked together in the office of the late-Sen. Daniel Brewster, D-Md.","1082","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"This is why Pelosi caused a stir several years ago when she was House speaker. She plucked Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., from relative obscurity to serve as “special assistant to the speaker.” The House Democratic Caucus hadn’t elected Van Hollen to anything. But Pelosi had drafted Van Hollen for a choice spot at the leadership table.","1083","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"Unquestionably, some saw Pelosi’s maneuver with Van Hollen as a power play against Hoyer. It was widely believed Van Hollen was Pelosi’s hand-picked successor should she leave the House.","1084","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"But Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., announced her retirement last month – and Van Hollen declared his intention to pursue her seat.","1085","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"It’s far from a done deal that Van Hollen will secure the Democratic nomination for Senate. Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., is also running. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., has expressed interest. The same with Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., who could self-fund. Reps. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Md., and John Sarbanes, D-Md. -- the son of former Sen.

"Time will tell. But interestingly, it’s not just Mikulski’s retirement that could impact House Democrats. Also consequential are the retirement of Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and the likely presidential bid of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.","1089","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"
"With Boxer cashing it in, some attention on Capitol Hill turned to Reps. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., as a possible successor. However, the big player on the field now is California Attorney General Kamala Harris. If the contest were today, it’s Harris’ to lose.","1090","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"

"Then there’s Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who also serves as chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Like Becerra, Wasserman Schultz is also ambitious. A few weeks ago, she considered running for Rubio’s Senate seat should he launch a White House campaign. But Wasserman Schultz then took a pass, saying she was committed to remaining at the DNC’s helm.","1092","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"

"Then there are wild cards. If and when Clyburn retires, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) will push for a seat at the table. Presuming he doesn’t run for the Senate, Cummings is expected to be part of that conversation. There will also be talk about recent CBC chairs like Reps. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., and Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus would like to have Becerra or someone else move up. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., is one to watch.

"But Pelosi has also brought someone else into the fold of late: Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y. Israel chaired the DCCC for two cycles in 2010 and 2012. In the past six months, Pelosi tapped Israel for a new position, serving as “chair of policy and communications.” Israel is viewed as a possible heir apparent if the opportunity arises. Those chances grew exponentially with Van Hollen leaping out of the wheelbarrow. Pelosi’s effort to keep Israel at the leadership table bolsters his chances as well.","1095","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/02/dem-retirements-touch-off-head-spinning-leadership-shuffle.html"

"One dynamic that can’t be overlooked is the prominence of Pelosi. Watch to see if she hand-picks, either overtly or not-so-overtly, a successor.

"Roth said in his report that more than 15 whistleblowers spoke with his investigators about Mayorkas.

"By the way, if you’ve been wondering just how bad Clinton’s email scandal really is, consider this your unofficial confirmation that it’s probably worse than you thought. After all, in his day job, Biden works in the White House. So he is privy to all sorts of information detailing just how big a legal fix Clinton is in for her sloppy handling, on a private home server, of emails and other sensitive information, some of which was top secret. The FBI is already investigating, and — while unlikely — it’s not totally inconceivable that the Justice Department might take legal action in the case. Biden could be reading the tea leaves.

"The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign.

"He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”","1516","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.

"The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.","1526","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"While the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.","1527","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.","1528","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"

"But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”","1530","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.","1531","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.","1532","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.","1533","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.","1534","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.","1535","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.”","1536","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"

"Adams and most of his fellow founding fathers believed that American liberty and what he called “Popery” were incompatible. He thought that Catholicism was a tyrannical religious system that required its followers to pay ultimate homage to the Pope. Catholicism’s “religious authority in the Western world, including its incomprehensible power of creating out of bread and wine the flesh and blood of God himself,” Adams once said, kept “human nature chained fast for ages in cruel, shameful, and deplorable servitude to him [the Pope], and his subordinate tyrants.”","1972","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/27/pope-francis-is-not-liberal-or-conservative-not-democrat-or-republican-is-catholic.html"

"Pundits and commentators insist on trying to comprehend Francis’s message in political terms. This is a wrongheaded approach. The Pope is not liberal or conservative. He is not a Democrat or Republican. He is a Catholic. And whatever he says about politics, culture, or the economy stems from this identity. Our propensity for trying to place the Pope in a political box says more about our culture than it does about the social views of the Catholic Church. Francis's visit has called attention to the tired, unimaginative, and intellectually stale way that we Americans think about public life. Americans are captive to ideological categories like ""Left: and ""Right."" They are captive to political parties that allow little original thought that does not conform to rigid and limited platforms.","1975","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/27/pope-francis-is-not-liberal-or-conservative-not-democrat-or-republican-is-catholic.html"
"And we have being thinking in these binary terms for a long time. Anyone who has seen the hit Broadway musical Hamilton will realize that this political habit has been around since the 1790s when Hamilton and Jefferson planted the roots of what would become our modern party system. It should thus not surprise us that so many Americans cannot make sense of Francis and his message. Marxists were criticized for thinking about the world in solely economic terms.

"The pope’s message is going to be a hard sell in our polarized culture. According to one commentator, if Francis can get the members of Congress to embrace his ideas it would be something akin to a miracle, and the Pope would be well on his way toward canonization as a Catholic saint! Francis is pro-life and believes marriage is between and a man and a woman. He has called abortion a ""sin,"" but he has also said that those who have committed this ""sin"" deserve forgiveness. He believes in climate change.

"This was a not so veiled attack against Hillary Clinton from Martin O’Malley on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate. It was uttered on a night when her opponents were more direct in their criticism but still did not appear to lay a glove on her.","2099","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"Indeed, O’Malley’s words are poignant, but ultimately won’t make much of a difference. Hillary Clinton is 19 points up nationally and Saturday night’s debate was another example of why she is so far in front.","2100","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"Just as in the first debate, Clinton showed the depth of her experience in politics over the last 30 years. She has the deepest understanding of the issues – particularly foreign policy having been secretary of state – and is a sharp, quick debater.","2101","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"

"She tripped up during an answer about Wall Street where she countered that her work to aid the 9/11 recovery while a New York senator made her a crusader against Wall Street. And her vote for the Iraq war haunted her again. These are points the GOP will seize upon and showed flashes of weakness.","2103","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"Saturday debate began with a series of questions on terrorism and how America can combat ISIS, especially in light of the heinous attacks in Paris on Friday night. We knew this would happen, as it should. And each of the candidates emphasized how important American leadership is in the fight against terrorism, something I agree with wholeheartedly.","2104","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"It was no surprise that Clinton was the most hawkish of the three candidates on stage. She talked of using airpower, training and equipping forces in the region and pushes our allies – especially Turkey and the Gulf States – to make up their minds about how much they’re going to help in this effort. Sanders and O’Malley had good rhetoric on the issue, but were vague and non-specific. And we also heard again that climate change is creating terrorism from Sanders – a claim that the Republicans will surely seize on.","2105","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"It must be noted that Clinton was trying to distance herself from Obama's statement that ISIS needs to be ""contained"" by saying they need to be ""defeated."" That being said, she did not declare war on ISIS. She did not forthrightly speak of the singular and unique role the U.S. must play in providing leadership, and sought to deflect attention from Sanders' efforts to link her with the rise of ISIS because of her support of the Iraq war by blaming George Bush.","2106","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"In short, it was a good and effective job for a Democratic primary audience, but all three candidates were on the defensive for much of the first part of the debate over the Middle East and the War on Terror. This will probably be a manageable challenge in the Democratic primary, but will almost certainly be a more serious challenge during the general election campaign. We will have to watch how this unfolds closely.","2107","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"Furthermore, none of the candidates were willing to say that we’re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness.","2108","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"Clinton had the best rationale for not using the term by defending it in terms of not offending our Muslim allies, but coming on the day after the Paris attacks, I’m sure this will be an issue.","2109","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"

"O’Malley got in on the action to tout how far he went as Maryland governor to raise wages, control gun violence and work to combat climate change. He certainly did better than he has before, but I don’t think he made a strong case for an O’Malley presidency. As Sanders pointed out, it’s not like Baltimore is doing too well right now. And he’s right.","2111","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"

"Sanders believes two things are of paramount importance: income inequality and climate change. His plans could push taxes on the rich upwards of 80 percent-- in a light moment he joked about Dwight Eisenhower levying a 90% tax -- and he’d bring back Glass-Steagall and break up the banks. Sanders supports a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition. And he brought the conversation on health care back to the idea of single payer, a favorite of the progressive left.","2113","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"These are all areas where you can see differences with Clinton. She only supports a $12 federal minimum wage and said it should be up to states/cities to raise it above that (this is also what Senate Democrats support). She wouldn’t break up the banks or bring back Glass-Steagall while at the same time arguing that her proposals go the furthest in reining in the banks.","2114","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"On health care, Clinton wants to build on ObamaCare and improve it, especially by focusing on the issue of prescription drug costs.","2115","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"It’s also important to note that all the candidates were allied on immigration – each supports comprehensive immigration plan and a pathway to citizenship.","2116","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"Martin O’Malley was the only candidate to say how many Syrian refugees he’d take in (65,000), but they all argued that it’s our humanitarian duty to take in refugees. This will also be a sticking point after the Paris attacks.","2117","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"

"Conservatives’ efforts to defund Planned Parenthood as part of the latest budget bill failed earlier this week, when Congress passed a “clean” short-term government budget measure. The battle could resurface in the coming months. According to Chaffetz’ office, about 41 percent of the group’s $1.3 billion in revenue is government funding.

"Buzz Cut: • Hillary hopes to beat the rap on a technicality • Report: Biden leaked son’s dying wish • Trade deal squeezes Hillary • Carly: ‘I am distinctly horrifying to liberals’ • A light blue towel with bloodshot eyes is wanted for questioning","2203","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/06/hillary-hopes-to-beat-rap-on-technicality.html"
"HILLARY HOPES TO BEAT THE RAP ON A TECHNICALITY Have you ever watched a courtroom drama in which the judge dramatically declares that a whole swath of evidence is inadmissible because its origins were tainted? That’s what Hillary Clinton is hoping Democrats do for her today with her first television ad. The new spot no doubt will add further anguish to Republicans contemplating the speakership of Kevin McCarthy. And it will, no doubt, certainly help frame the former secretary of state’s testimony later this month about the deadly raid of 2012 in Benghazi, Libya. But the point here is primarily about locking up a primary which has proved remarkably difficult for Clinton. She should not be trailing the 74-year-old socialist senator from Vermont anywhere, not even New Hampshire. And Vice President Joe Biden’s bubble should’ve popped a long time ago. While the two of them have certainly had their disagreements, she and Biden represent essentially the same part of the Democratic Party. Remember: that’s why Barack Obama picked Biden as his running mate in 2008. Her problems certainly stem from her acknowledged struggle to interact with human beings. A manful effort by her media partners at NBC for the past week notwithstanding, Clinton still struggles with empathy. But Clinton’s biggest problem is the same one that her establishment counterpart on the Republican side has: electability. Usually the domain of underdogs and outsiders, it is the runners in the inside lanes who have the electability woes in this topsy cycle. For Jeb Bush, his electability problems don’t relate to him as much as they relate to his last name (though he certainly is making an effort to be his own man in that regard, too). For Clinton, the reason she is faring so poorly against her would-be general election rivals is that Americans broadly mistrust her and there is baggage still to unpack. Given her misleading, obfuscatory and facile answers to the persistent scandals that have dogged her candidacy, Democrats have good reason to believe that there is more to come. With Clinton comes of possibility of catastrophic failure. That’s true of any candidate. But in Clinton’s case the percentage possibility is just too high that her campaign for the White House could end with a press conference in a U.S. attorney’s office or the release of emails so politically damaging that she has to pull the plug on her own campaign. Even if it were only a 10 percent chance of total meltdown, it would be too high for most Democrats. So what Clinton is trying to do is get off on a technicality – to rule much of the evidence against her inadmissible. No one would know about the server, or the classified emails if it wasn't for those pesky kids in Congress. And while it might seem a little too rich to have one of the most politically calculating operators in recent memory complaining about political calculation in others, it won’t take much to convince Democrats that the Republicans are out to get her. The revival of the impeachment-era effort to declare facts void because of their provenance may in fact help Democrats rally to her side in this time of need, but it will be the evidence that is revealed that will damn or save her campaign. It’s what is revealed over the next year that counts, whatever context in which Clinton places it. So just to recap what ought to cause Democrats worry, regardless of how the scandal sled got going: Monday revealed long-time Clinton aide Philippe Reines misled reporters about his own use of private email at the State Department when reports surfaced that he had corresponded with reporters about official business on his own private email. Another Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, triple-dipped while working for the State Department, Clinton Foundation, and consulting firm Teneo simultaneously. Documents pertaining to her will come out later this week. Clinton claimed that she willingly turned over all of her emails to be transparent, but… nope. She also promised the public (and her party) that her server would remain private and that potentially embarrassing emails had been destroyed, but it’s now being combed through by the FBI. And speaking of that server, Clinton also claimed she didn’t send any classified material. Oops. REPORT: BIDEN LEAKED SON’S DYING WISH It’s getting rough out there... In a story that must thrill Team Hillary, Politico reports that “…it was Biden himself who talked to [NYT Columnist Maureen Dowd], painting a tragic portrait of a dying son, Beau’s face partially paralyzed, sitting his father down and trying to make him promise to run for president because ‘the White House should not revert to the Clintons and that the country would be better off with Biden values.’” [Milbank: “Finally, it can be reported: Joe Biden is running for president, unless he isn’t. He will announce his decision this weekend, unless he doesn’t.”] Trade deal squeezes Hillary - Monday’s announcement of a Pacific trade pact puts Hillary Clinton in a tight predicament: please her liberal base or risk the wrath of her former boss. Sen. Bernie Sanders came out fast, calling the trade deal “disastrous,” and with union support in the balance Clinton can ill-afford to add to the erosion on the left. But with chaffing points on issues like Syria and the Keystone XL pipeline already raw, an open break by Clinton on a key Obama legacy policy could result in the president nudging Joe Biden to run. Clinton’s ambiguous wait-and see position on the trade deal presumably at an end, pressure to cease the waffling is quickly building. Bernie’s gun conundrum - WaPo: “Sanders (I-Vt.), said Monday that his campaign is assembling a ‘comprehensive package’ of measures to address gun violence and that he believes there is a way to bridge the country’s deep political divisions over the issue…Gun control remains a challenging issue for Sanders, who by nearly every other measure has the most progressive record in the Democratic field. But Sanders represents a largely rural state with a strong hunting tradition and relatively few restrictions on firearms, and he has a mixed voting record that includes opposition to the landmark Brady Bill in 1993 and support of legislation in 2005 that shielded gun manufacturers from lawsuits.” [Watch Fox: Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner joins Gretchen Carlson on “The Real Story” at 2 p.m. ET.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… The Telegraph: “The sketches and paintings, if proved to be authentic, would be worth an estimated [$785,701,000]. Experts said that after two years of rigorous analysis, they had found ‘remarkable similarities’ between the newly-discovered works, kept in a castle in Milan, and the known works of Caravaggio. But the announcement came out of the blue, caused an immediate storm in the art world and raised as many questions as it answered. The historians apparently managed to keep their research a secret for two years, but on Friday their findings will be published in a lavish, two-volume, 600-page e-book in four languages. The works are believed to date from Caravaggio’s earliest years as a painter, when he was a young apprentice under Simone Peterzano, a mannerist painter in Milan, from 1584 to 1588.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

A LIGHT BLUE TOWEL WITH BLOODSHOT EYES IS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING The Youngstown Vindicator: “[Austintown, Ohio] police were called to a home Friday night by a man who complained he was ‘too high’ after smoking marijuana. According to a police report, authorities were called … by a 22-year old male who had smoked the drug. The officer who responded to the home could hear the man groaning from a room. The officer then found the man lying ‘on the floor in the fetal position’ and ‘was surrounded by a plethora of Doritos, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish and Chips Ahoy cookies,’ the report said. The man also told police he couldn’t feel his hands. A glass pipe with marijuana residue, two packs of rolling papers, two roaches and a glass jar of marijuana were recovered from the man’s car after he gave the keys to police. The man declined medical treatment at the home Friday night.

"Understanding the mathematical equation to the speakership is complex yet essential.

"McCarthy certainly enjoys the lion's share of the vote -- somewhere around 200 supporters. But at least 30-40 votes could go to Webster since the Freedom Caucus threw its support behind him.

"It's doubtful McCarthy can command 218 supporters in the conference. Indeed, it's daunting for any candidate to hit 218 votes on the floor.

Ed Markey, D-Mass., received $22,290 and voted with other Planned Parenthood-backed senators including Jeanne Shaheen, of New Hampshire, Al Franken, of Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, to block the move.","2674","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/13/planned-parenthood-workers-pacs-donated-25m-to-dems-since-2000.html"

"DEMS TOY WITH BERNIE AS HILLARY SEES SWING STATE DROP The bad news for Hillary Clinton today comes in two polls. One is from New Hampshire that shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders getting to within 10 points of Clinton and another that shows her trailing in must-win Ohio and knotted up against less-known potential GOP rivals in swing states Florida and Pennsylvania. The New Hampshire poll tells us that Democrats are thinking this election is in the bag and are indulging themselves with the idea of offering symbolic support for a self-described socialist who favors a policy list that would make swing and independent blanch. Trillions of spending and new taxes on everything from free college to global warming are not winners for debt-averse, economically insecure suburbanites. Republican voters, after two heartbreaking quadrennial elections, are kicking old habits with an eye on retaking the White House. Democrats, though, may be trying to get back on the Hopium in a misplaced belief that their victory is inevitable. If Democratic voters get Sanders into the discussion with Clinton and potentially even force her to adopt even more of his far-out positions, the party will be badly damaging its chances. Driven substantially by her falling trustworthiness, Clinton finds herself in trouble compared to three months ago in Quinnipiac University’s swing-state poll. Clinton does best on Florida (not good news for either of the favorite sons running there) but in all three, the results are fairly consistent. Take Ohio. In March, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was trailing Clinton by 9 points. This week, it’s down to 1 point. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker trailed in a head-to-head matchup by 11 points. Now it’s 4 points. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rand Paul improved by 6 points and 5 points, respectively. And the state’s Gov. John Kasich went from a 1-point deficit in January to a 7-point advantage today. Some if this is a result of Clinton’s policy changes and efforts to identify herself as a partisan figure and a very liberal one at that, but another part is that voters increasingly distrust her. But the net effect is to damage her standing with general-election voters. And herein we see another problem with “inevitable” candidates: They struggle to get their parties in line because they lack the powerful political motivator of fear. GOWDY: HILLARY’S LIBYA SOURCE WAS FUNNELING ‘INTEL’ FROM POTENTIAL PROFITEER Fox News: “Longtime Clinton insider Sidney Blumenthal was ‘merely a conduit’ and did not write the numerous memos about Libya he forwarded to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the chairman of the House panel investigating the deadly 2012 Benghazi attacks said Tuesday. Blumenthal was forwarding information from someone who may have had business interests in Libya, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly after Blumenthal spent nearly nine hours at the Capitol as Gowdy’s committee met in closed session…. ‘Not only was [Blumenthal] providing unvetted, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated intelligence to our top diplomat, he was just simply forwarding on intelligence that somebody by the name of Tyler Drumheller was sending him,’ Gowdy said.” “[Clinton] used the word ‘unsolicited’…When these emails are released, I want you to count the number of times she says ‘keep ‘em coming’ ‘this is great’ ‘useful information.’ I don’t know what her definition of unsolicited is, but it is very strikingly different from my own.”— Benghazi committee chairman, Trey Gowdy on “The Kelly File.” Watch the interview here. Gate crasher - The Hill: “Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) tried to crash former Hillary Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal’s deposition before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Tuesday. Issa marched into the closed-door deposition and remained inside for about a minute before he was escorted out by the panel’s chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). The pair briefly exchanged hushed words in a nearby hallway before Issa stormed off, throwing an empty soda can into a nearby trash bin.” [Incomplete accounting - WSJ provides the documents’ current state of play and why it matters.] Trade still looms for Dems - Fortune: “The House is giving itself until the end of July to reconsider denying President Obama the negotiating authority he needs to wrap up a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade pact…Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters Tuesday the decision came after several conversations with Obama about the way forward.” Dems fume over new Obama/GOP trade plan - WashEx reports that the idea that Obama might accept a GOP plan to pass a narrower trade bill is creating an uproar in Democratic ranks. “I think he would really, really piss off the majority of his party” if he went along with such a scenario, said Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., one of the most conservative members of the Congressional Black Caucus who sometimes votes with Republicans, but opposes fast track. Dems waffle on Defense - National Journal: “Senate Democrats were against defense authorization before they were for it. Or maybe it’s the other way around. Either way, their message is mixed: They fully support the troops, but they really don’t like how Republicans are supporting the troops with contingency war funds.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Christopher Lee’s iconic villains may have some inspiration from real life horror. Lee, who died at age 92 earlier this month, was witness to the last public execution in France done by guillotine. The executed that day was Eugène Weidmann, a man convicted of several murders and kidnappings in the area. Women waited after his execution to dip their handkerchiefs in his blood. Authorities realized that instead of creating a public deterrent for crime, public executions riled public passions. Lee witnessed Weidmann’s beheading 76 years ago today.

We were under attack. I think it was appropriate. It was also appropriate to change the policies once…we had enough history.” — Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on “Hannity” saying that as president he would not permit the use of interrogation techniques authorized by his brother, George, and deemed “torture” by critics. [National Journal: “…The amendment divided the four Senate Republicans intent on winning the White House in 2016. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida were against it, while Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas voted for it.”] Team Jeb escalates Florida fight with Rubio - Bloomberg: “[Jeb Bush] backers…heavily emphasized his executive experience… [and] Rubio’s lack of it… Even as they hail Rubio’s charisma and political talents, some Florida Republicans worry that the 44-year-old senator and former speaker of the Florida House—whose campaign declined to comment for this story—is unready for the task of taking on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and leading the country.” [Feeling good again - Wash Ex: “…Some Bushies … were momentarily nervous. Jeb Bush’s well-executed opening campaign rally and sharply written, succinctly orated speech calmed jitters and left the governor's backers in about as confident a position as they were when he shook up the race in December when he signaled his intention to seek the nomination.”] But does he have a Harley? - Scott Walker filed for president Tuesday, according to the Federal Elections Commission. No, not that one. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s camp says he is still un-declared. Instead a same-name candidate joined the nearly 100 Republicans who have who have made their intention known to the FEC. Carly takes ‘The View’- Legal Insurrection’s Amy Miller gives analysis of Carly Fiorina’s performance on all ladies talk show. Miller writes, “At around the 3:40 mark, the lovely ladies steered the conversation toward the problem of Fox and CNN using polling data to decide which candidates will be allowed to participate in the initial debates. It didn’t feel like a malicious question, but it did put her in a vulnerable position. This would have been a perfect opportunity for Fiorina to knock Fox, or white male presidential candidates, or the polling system in general, but she didn’t do it. Instead, she dropped a ‘started from the bottom now I’m here’ nugget, and looked confident when she said, ‘I’m kind of used to being underestimated, so I’m sort of assuming I might make it to those first [debates].’” [Fiorina’s campaign Carly for America came under fire earlier this year due to the F.E.C. rule that PAC names cannot contain the name of a candidate. This week, the PAC changed the name to Conservative, Authentic, Responsive Leadership for You and for America, or CARLY for America.] Back to bros? - Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and fellow Bluegrass stater Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have joined op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader on how the EPA’s Clean Water Act is just another example of government overreach. Perry takes Hillary to the movies - Former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, released an ad that has Hillary Clinton in the front row seat of her own flick. Throwback images of her Benghazi hearing testimony, new tidbits of foreign donations, and a shadow of Hillary in a van make for an intensely comical spin. #CruzCrew hits Twitter record - Wash Ex: “…The independent grassroots support group ‘Cruz Control’ blasted out nearly 75,000 tweets on the candidate’s behalf under the #CruzCrew hashtag…[an unnamed spokesperson said] by midnight on June 16, ‘74,532 tweets, yielding 1.1 billion impressions, had been dispatched by the army of #Cruz Crew volunteers.’” Goldilocks Graham - “If you think Marco is too young, and Bush is one too many, and you think Scott Walker is not quite ready for the job then over time you start looking at a guy like me.” — Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to Fox News Ayotte knocks Fox News, CNN debates - Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., is decrying the debate criteria used by Fox News and other networks in establishing participants for presidential debates. In a statement, she called for more influence for New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary saying, “the debate criteria should be based on candidates’ early state performance.” [Former Gov. George Pataki, R-N.Y., told the New Hampshire Union Leader he would participate in the paper’s forum on the same day as the Fox News Channel debates in Ohio. “I’ll put my trust in the voters,” Pataki told the newspaper “especially here in New Hampshire.” Pataki registered zero support in this week’s Monmouth University’s New Hampshire poll.] Carson hires neophyte finance chairman - Wash Ex’s David Drucker writes that Ben Carson is picking other non-politicos to run his presidential campaign in a new way. Read more from Carson’s interview here. Schake warns GOP on electoral quagmire - Hoover Institution’s Kori Schake writes that Republicans can’t win on their foreign policy platform alone. Despite President Obama’s dive in popularity for his foreign policy agenda Schake says the Republicans also don’t have a coherent strategy. As she writes, “Many candidates are allowing themselves to be drawn into debating troop levels for Iraq without explaining either the political objective that military force would achieve…” GOOD OLD REGULATION 27, SECTION 37 Germany is famed for its orderly towns and cities, but sometimes it gets a little, um, verrückt. The Local tells the tale of a traffic light in Germany that never changes to green. Why? Well, according to the local authorities, “Because on [that street] one is only allowed to turn right, in accordance with regulation 27, section 37 of the transport regulations, we can do without using the traffic signal’s green light.” Then why not just have a stop sign? “Stop signs do not correspond to traffic light systems and do not fulfill the same set of regulations.” The orderliness even continues to the finances: the annual budget includes amber and green replacement bulbs, just in case. AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “…It would be analytic overkill to go, to parse the actual things [Donald Trump] said. I think it was great showmanship, it was stream of consciousness. I think single most important statement was ‘I am very rich.’ That’s the basis for the campaign...I can assure you one thing: the mainstream media who wished the Republicans no good will lavish upon him enormous coverage.” — Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… In the continued openness that Pope Francis seeks to bring to the Chair of Saint Peter, the Vatican announced its blessing to name a square in Rome after German priest Martin Luther, reports RNS. The move is surprising due to the tense history between the two. In 1517 Luther, displeased with the corruption he saw in the Church, particularly the selling of indulgences, wrote up a list of devastating criticisms against the Church. After nailing his 95 theses to the chapel door at the University of Wittenberg where he was studying, Pope Leo X tried to end Luther’s defiance and force him to recant his statements. Luther, however, continued his teachings, and directly attacked the papacy. He was not only excommunicated, but also declared a heretic. Luther’s teachings divided the Catholic Church and led to the Protestant reformation. And now he will have his own square…right next to Vatican City. What’s nearly five centuries between friends, anyway?","2730","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillarys-nightmare-haunts-dems.html"

"TRUMP STILL ON FENCE OVER SIGNING PLEDGE In an interview with the NYT in South Carolina Thursday, Donald Trump still seemed unsure about signing a pledge requiring candidates to support the eventual Republican nominee, whoever that may be. Signing the pledge is mandatory in order to participate in the South Carolina primary next year. Trump cited his business ethics as part of the reason he’s on the fence. Trump said after his speech at the Upstate Chamber of Commerce in Greenville, S.C., “I don’t make commitments and break them.” NYT report also adds, “[Trump said] if he did sign but lost the nomination, he would not run as an independent, a concern among many Republicans.” Trump also dispelled the HuffPo piece that said he assured local party members he would sign the pledge saying “I haven’t told anybody that.” Trump has stated in the past that he wouldn’t run as a third party candidate if he felt he was treated well, but what exactly he means by that is…well, up to him. Trump, Cruz get cozy on Capitol Hill - The Hill: “Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) are jointly hosting a rally on Capitol Hill on Sept. 9 to protest the nuclear deal with Iran. The event, being organized by Tea Party Patriots, the Center for Security Policy and the Zionist Organization of America, will be staged on the West Lawn of the Capitol, the groups said in a statement. Cruz, the keynote speaker, invited Trump to speak, the statement said.” [The Weekly Standard’s Fred Barnes writes the despite having candidates like Cruz, Rubio, and Jindal, all of who tout proud immigrant stories, the GOP is still plagued with anti-immigrant rhetoric. Barnes writes, “Sadly, it’s a theme far more likely to hurt the party’s chances in the 2016 election than help, notably in winning Hispanic support.”] POWER PLAY: Teflon Trump?

The original fundraiser was supposed to be earlier, but due to scheduling conflicts, Bush will be in New York on the day before the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Former Gov.

[Bush holds a veteran’s town hall meeting today in Norfolk, Virginia.] Jeb gets Cantor endorsement - Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., endorsed Jeb Bush Thursday, and is set to join the Bush campaign’s Virginia base. Cantor tweeted, “@JebBush is a true leader w/ a long-term vision for our country and the know how to implement it– not just talk about it.

Scott Walker on Friday will link the threats of Iran and the Islamic State and stress the need to adopt an aggressive military stance. ‘As president, I will send the following message: the retreat is over,’ Walker plans to say, according to excerpts of his speech released by his campaign. ‘American leadership is back and, together with our allies, we will not surrender another inch of ground to terrorists or any other power that threatens our safety. ‘America will not be intimidated. And neither will I.’” Rubio defines China-policy - In an WSJ op-ed, Marco Rubio details how his administration would handle China. Rubio says it’s a balancing act between being tough, and still keeping trade open. Rubio writes, “If elected U.S. president next fall, I will approach China on the basis of strength and example, not weakness and appeasement…But to achieve a new era of productive relations between our nations, America must stand on the side of the Chinese people rather than their autocratic rulers.” Copy Cat? - After Scott Walker has been talking China for days team Rubio decided to put out an op-ed solely focused on China. Could be coincidental with what’s happening in the markets now, but Bloomberg’s Mark Halpern gives a look back that seems to build a pattern of team Rubio mimicking Walker’s moves over the past month.

Overriding a veto requires a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress -- 290 votes in the 435-seat House and 67 votes in the 100-seat Senate. A failure to override the veto means Congress didn’t demonstrate the sufficient legislative resolve to halt the package.

While it is extremely rare for a president to make a visit like this before a big vote, the last-minute lobbying comes after the president also made a surprise appearance at the annual congressional baseball game between Democrats and Republicans the night before.

"TPA, which would give the president the ability to ""fast-track"" future trade deals, is one of two bills due up in the House on Friday. And it’s anybody’s guess if the bills will pass.

"First, the basics.","2874","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"Most House Republicans want to approve TPA. But they don’t quite have the votes to do it on their own. They need Democratic support. Yet the irony is that even though Obama is pushing the deal, only about 20-plus House Democrats support their own chief executive on this issue.","2875","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"So various political gambits kick in.","2876","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"Republicans find it absurd that Obama can’t persuade more than two-dozen Democratic members to support the trade plan.

"Pelosi and Boehner engineered a deal to advance the trade framework to the floor – so long as Democrats scored a vote on something called Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA).","2879","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"TAA is a program near and dear to the hearts of many Democrats. It’s a method to cushion the blow for various workers and industries damaged by business reallocations in trade agreements. So House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., teed up two votes for Friday: One for TAA and one on TPA. But a TPA vote was contingent on the House first adopting TAA. The procedural maneuver would require Republicans to carry most of the freight to adopt TPA. But to get there, Democrats would be expected to provide the lion’s share of votes for TAA. If the House doesn’t approve TAA, everything comes to a screeching halt and there’s no vote on TPA.","2880","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"

And then there’s Pelosi – stuck in the middle.","2882","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"On trade, Pelosi is a switch-pitcher. She’s trying to keep the Democratic caucus from embarrassing Obama with a paltry vote total for TPA. Yet she’s working to make sure most of her caucus gets what it wants: a defeat of TPA. At the same time, Pelosi secured a deal for the TAA vote – which could help pass TPA … or blow it up.","2883","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"
"Major League Baseball has a rule for ambidextrous pitchers, few as there may be. Such cross-hurlers must first declare whether they intend to pitch left-handed or right-handed to each batter.

"But Democrats are working against Pelosi. A senior House GOP leadership source says Republicans can only provide 50 to 70 votes for TAA. Democrats must make up the difference. However, many Democrats now see a means to an end. Some intend to vote no on TAA simply to detonate the entire process and never get the TPA bill to the floor -- which they so despise.","2885","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/democratic-gambits-threaten-obama-trade-agenda.html"

"“All three say they are undecided, but appear to indicate they are leaning toward voting in favor of cloture,” Rodriguez indicated. “Reportedly, Landrieu has been using her leverage to attempt to change the bill as it moves forward and won a particularly sweet deal that could bring billions to Louisiana.”","3137","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/01/new-emails-show-clinton-efforts-on-hill-helped-pass-obamacare-after-failed-3.html"

Each has warned they're not a guaranteed ‘yes; vote on final passage,” Rodriguez informed the secretary.","3140","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/01/new-emails-show-clinton-efforts-on-hill-helped-pass-obamacare-after-failed-3.html"

"President Obama has worked furiously to get congressional approval for the international deal, which would limit Iran’s nuclear-development program in exchange for the lifting of billions of dollars’ worth of crippling economic sanctions.

"The tandem trips -- Democrats returned Monday and Republicans depart later this week -- gave Netanyahu the chance to press his case in person.

"If all Republicans in both Houses stand firm against the deal, a veto override would require 43 Democrat votes in the House and 13 in the Senate.

Eliot Engel in coming out publicly against the deal, it could provide momentum for blocking it.","3156","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/house-members-regular-august-trip-to-israel-has-potential-this-time-to.html"
"Schumer, who is expected to become the next Senate Democratic leader, broke from the president on Thursday and said that he would vote to disapprove of the deal, fearing Iran will use it to, in fact.

"Buzz Cut: • Hillary outrunning her own privilege • Reporter leaves no turn unstoned • 2016 GOP Power Index: Voters pick Cruz, Carson and Carly as debate winners • Jeb’s PAC surfaces with mega TV buy • Shuttlecocks not fascism!","3218","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/17/hillary-outrunning-her-own-privilege.html"
"HILLARY OUTRUNNING HER OWN PRIVILEGE Can Hillary Clinton be this bad at running for president and still get away with it? For now, the answer would appear to be yes. But we are starting to see her reaching the tether of the privileges associated with being a president’s wife, her party’s 2008 runner-up and the beneficiary $2 billion campaign apparatus. It’s still her turn on the Democratic side, but an awful lot of Democrats are coming to wish there was another way. The latest Fox News poll shows Clinton losing 10 points of her lead since last month on Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders still trails by 19 points and isn’t going to be overtaking her anytime soon, but that’s kind of the point. For all her months of working and fighting and pandering, she’s still losing ground to a guy who complained about excessive deodorant choice in the American supermarket. And she certainly gives Democrats ample reason. Clinton, whose conduct as secretary of state is currently the subject of a federal criminal probe, joked in Iowa on Friday “You may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account,” she said. “I love it. I love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.” Ugh. The team of writers who worked on that joke should be fired, en masse. Like George W. Bush’s jokes about the search for the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, it wasn’t that it was too soon, it was that it would never be funny. In Clinton’s worldview, her shady email antics are but a distraction. She’s wrong. Given the ethical allegations against Clinton plus the controversies surrounding her time in office, especially her Libya misadventure, hiding emails is serious stuff. And as the poll shows, 58 percent of registered voters believed she lied about having classified material on her private server. Fifty-four percent said doing so put national security at risk. Ha-ha-ha… More telling, though, is what Clinton said to reporters about the widening FBI probe of her security practices. Clinton said she would “let whatever this inquiry is” run its course and not get distracted because that’s not what voters are asking her about. Good grief! So not only does the candidate denigrate the investigation while it is ongoing but also supposes that because of what people pre-selected by her campaign for human interaction say to her it’s not resonating with voters. If they were picking panda bears for her to nuzzle instead of Iowans, one assumes Hillary would be consumed with talk of delicious, leafy tender baby bamboo. Mmmmm, bamboo… If the other candidate of privilege, Jeb Bush, were this bad at running for president he would have already had to quit the race. And anyone else would have had to have fled the country. If Clinton really is this bad as a candidate, there is no amount of money or power that can rescue her. Democrats will instead have to place all of their hopes on a complete Republican meltdown. So at least they’ve got that going for them… Reporter leaves no turn unstoned - Politico reports that the Democratic donors Biden would “need to be viable appear to be ruling him out” based on the responses of people who attended a Hillary Clinton fundraiser on Martha’s Vineyard. The reporter must next be headed to Wrigley Field to see who’s picking the Cardinals for the World Series. 2016 Democratic Power Index: Joe’s back from the beach - 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Joe Biden [+1]; 3) Bernie Sanders [-1]; 4) Martin O’Malley; 5) Jim Webb; 6) Elizabeth Warren; 7) Lincoln Chaffee; 8) Al Gore [previously unranked] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… One hundred years ago this day, Charles F. Kettering was issued a patent on a gadget that made daily life for Americans less cranky, literally. The DELCO co-founder’s “engine-starting device” was the first electric ignition device for automobiles. As History.com describes, “In the early years of the automobile, drivers used iron hand cranks to start the internal combustion process that powered the engines on their cars. In addition to requiring great hand and arm strength, this system was not without certain risks: If the driver forgot to turn his ignition off before turning the crank, the car could backfire or roll forward...By making cars easier and safer to operate, especially for women, the self-starting engine caused a huge jump in sales, and helped foster a fast-growing automobile culture in America.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

The big winners in the Fox News poll out Sunday were primarily identified as outsiders. Donald Trump remained in first place, but with some suggestion that his support may have peaked as his vote share held steady and respondents who watched the debate judge him to have done the worst. He is also the most disliked among GOP primary voters. With a new immigration policy proposal that makes Mitt Romney’s self-deportation sound like trip to the spa, Trump will continue to shape the race by setting the marker for (presumably) the ultra-restrictive position in the field. But there’s no indication that he’s done much to broaden his appeal. Not so for Sen. Ted Cruz, who is running as a more practical version of Trump. Cruz got back into the top tier for the first time since immediately after his launch and, given his deep pockets, large organization and the failures of competitors like Sen. Rand Paul (down to 3 percent from steady double-digits this spring), it is again possible to imagine the Texas senator being in contention when the GOP gets to the home stretch for the nomination in March. Cruz may have been in politics and government off and on for 20 years, but his torch work in Washington clearly identifies him as an outsider’s insider. However, the candidates who benefitted the most from the exposure of debate night are clearly those with the least political experience in the field: Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. While candidates like Trump and Jeb Bush came to the process already famous, Carson and Fiorina are little known in the political space. Having tens of millions of people tune in has limited upside for candidates already known to all, but as Carson and Fiorina show, big potential for those they are getting to know and might just like. As for those who are following a more traditional path to the nomination, including Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio: August is why you need deep pockets. All three saw their numbers fall as attention shifted to the biggest lights from the debate. But as pressure grows on candidates like Rick Perry, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal and Lindsey Graham to abandon their bids for the good of the party, the field should sort itself out to the advantage of Bush, Walker and Rubio.

Ads are scheduled to begin in Iowa and New Hampshire on Sept. 15, in South Carolina a week later and then run continuously through the end of the year. The plan, shared by the group with The Associated Press prior to Monday's buy, is the first evidence of Right to Rise USA's major strategic spending of the roughly $100 million it had on hand last month.” [Fox News colleague Serafin Gomez reports that Bush will get the endorsement of a dozen Medal of Honor recipients in South Carolina today.] Trump targets Walker in Iowa - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “Billionaire businessman Donald Trump launched another attack against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker Saturday during a campaign stop at the Iowa State Fair. Trump, who has overtaken Walker as the front-runner in the crucial state in recent polls, slammed the Republican governor and his record in Wisconsin, saying ‘there's tremendous dissension all over the state.’ The real estate mogul said that economic growth under Walker has been ‘terrible.’ Trump's comments echoed attacks he has made against Walker in recent weeks. Until recently, polls showed Walker as the front-runner in Iowa and several other crucial early primary states. But several polls released in the wake of the first GOP debate have shown Walker dropping and Trump surging into a strong lead. ‘His growth is terrible in terms of the state,’ Trump said. ‘There's tremendous dissension all over the state.’” Will it wash? - Walker and Fiorina are both on the Des Moines Register soapbox at the Iowa State Fair today. [The first jury pool with a hot tub - Donald Trump today arrives for jury duty in Manhattan.] “It’s not clear to me that Donald Trump is a Republican.” – Carly Fiorina in an interview with ABC News. Carson’s Sunday strategy paying off - Des Moines Register: “Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson spent his Sunday morning at the church of a Des Moines civil rights activist. The former pediatric brain surgeon shared stories of his rise from inner-city poverty and posed solutions for a more promising future for America's youth. The Rev. Keith Ratliff, former president of the Iowa & Nebraska branch of the NAACP, called Carson an inspiration for the youth in his community. He also said Carson, the lone African-American among 15-plus viable GOP candidates, could reverse negative views some minorities hold toward the Republican Party.” Kasich snags Alabama Gov. Bentley’s backing - The Alabama Media Group had the scoop on Gov. Robert Bentley’s endorsement today of his Ohio counterpart, John Kasich. While Kasich is no favorite to win the state’s March 1 primary (Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich were first and second in 2012) Bentley’s backing shows a surprising Deep South strength for Kasich and might help garner some delegate count next year. Alabama Media also had this detail, which will make both men more unpopular in 48 other states: “Bentley, a University of Alabama graduate and huge Bama fan will present Kasich with a signed UA football by coach Nick Saban. Kasich, a graduate of The Ohio State University, in turn will present Bentley with a football signed by Ohio State coach Urban Meyer.” [Kasich heads to South Carolina where he will officially file to appear on the state’s Republican primary ballot.] Huck heading back to Israel - Far from walking back his comments about President Obama marching Israel to “the doors of the oven” with his Iran nuclear deal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is highlighting his connections to the Jewish state with a trip this week. Huckabee told CNN he was heading to Tel Aviv on Tuesday for fundraising and meetings with officials. Home game - Huckabee’s campaign points out that they are deeper and wider on the ground in early states than most. Huckabee’s daughter and campaign manager, Sarah Sanders, told Fox News First that while Jeb Bush’s campaign has gotten lots of attention for an expansive Iowa staff, Huckabee has more: 71 county chairs and 139 “grassroots leaders” across the state. In South Carolina, the campaign touts similar numbers. You can get the full rundown here. SHUTTLECOCKS NOT FASCISM! The Independent: “A Spanish athlete was forced to maintain a fixed smile at during a podium ceremony at the Badminton World Championships after organisers played the fascist version of her national anthem. During the ceremony in Jakarta, Indonesia Carolina Marin did not give anything away as the old lyrics to the Spanish national anthem “Royal March”, which have not been used since 1978, played alongside the music. The 22-year-old world number old smiled and pointedly looked ahead as the Spanish flag was raised to mark her victory over Indian player Salina Nehwal, the Local reports.

"DEMS CONFRONT PAST FAILURES ON GUN CONTROL “When I ran in 2008, I in fact did not say I would fix it. I said we could fix it.” –President Obama at a Beverly Hills fundraiser discussing the mass murder at a Charleston, S.C. church. The only really clear mandate after President Obama’s 2012 re-election was to not be Mitt Romney. Obama had won more in spite of his policies than because of them, but had successfully convinced voters that Romney was too risky a pick. After the grindingest grind of an election in presidential political history, Obama had won another term of what, exactly? Endless battles with the GOP House on taxes and spending? Foreign policy headaches? More scorched earth fights protecting ObamaCare? Blech. But at that very moment, a meteor crashed into American public life: The senseless slaughter of 20 children and six educators at a Connecticut elementary school less than two weeks before Christmas. A fatherless, mentally ill 20-year-old had killed his mother, stolen her guns and laid waste to a group of students at a nearby school, all aged 6 and 7. Obama wept in private and shed tears in public, as most parents must have. He also found new purpose for the second term of his presidency. Two days after the murders, Obama would make a mighty vow: “In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens … in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.” As an orthodox liberal, Obama had always been a proponent of gun control. But it had hardly been a top-drawer concern. For example, when a gunman killed 13 people at an immigration center in Binghamton, N.Y. in April of 2009, Obama called it “senseless violence,” but did not demand that the Democratic-controlled Congress push through gun control. The Connecticut killings, different in nature and coming as they did when Obama was looking to do more than just defend his legacy, spurred him headlong into the divided Congress with demands for the most sweeping gun control legislation since the Clinton era. Even though the legislation wouldn’t have prevented the shooting had it been in place, gun violence became the animating issue for the Democratic Party. The legislation was cued up and public pressure was enormous. The daily shouts from television, social media and elsewhere were for action, action, action. But before too long, Democrats lost their nerve. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ended up killing even a compromise package that would have required background checks at gun shows and for private sales. All the thunder came to naught. And here we are again. This time it is nine Christians at worship at a historic church in Charleston, S.C. The place that once heard the exultant cries of freed slaves heard the anguished ones of murder victims. It would be wholly unfair to say that the legislation proposed by the president would have in any way prevented the killings. But one wonders why a party and a president who believed that more gun regulations would save lives gave up so easily. [Watch Fox: Correspondent Rich Edson is in Charleston with the latest on the shooting.] “Can government save you? Can government be the be-all end-all? The reason I ask is that I meet with pastors, and they're looking at government for the answers. I look back at them and I say, 'I'm looking at you for help.'"" – Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., at a meeting of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. “I hope we, the American people, can come to the understanding that we are not each other’s enemies. The enemies are those who are stoking the flames of division, trying to divide us into every category and weakening us as a society.” – Ben Carson on “The Kelly File” ‘CLINTON INC.’ PAID EVEN BIGGER BUCKS TO BLUMENTHAL Fox News: “Clinton confidant [Sidney Blumenthal] under scrutiny on Capitol Hill over detailed Libya memos he sent to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told lawmakers earlier this week he has been pulling in $200,000 a year from Clinton ally David Brock’s media operation, congressional sources tell FoxNews.com.….The money was in addition to the $10,000 a month he was getting for work with the Clinton Foundation. ‘He was getting, from Clinton, Inc., $320,000 a year,’ one source told FoxNews.com…. The source said Blumenthal has been working with Media Matters, American Bridge and Correct the Record…. Though it's unclear exactly what Blumenthal was paid to do, Politico reported his work entailed giving high-level strategy and messaging guidance, and the Benghazi debate was likely part of that. The groups above have busily defended then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from GOP broadsides.” Clinton doubles down on executive amnesty – USA TODAY: “Speaking Thursday before the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, Clinton [said]… she would fight for comprehensive immigration reform that includes ‘a real path to citizenship’ for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants who have settled in the United States…oppose any move to deport the young immigrants known as ’Dreamers’ or to undo President Obama’s executive actions that are shielding millions of immigrants from enforcement action. And that if Congress continues to balk at acting on immigration reform, ‘as president I will do everything possible under the law to go even further than what President Obama has attempted to achieve,’ she said.” [Clinton continues to rake in the West Coast cash with fundraisers in the Los Angeles area. President Obama is also in the state fundraising for the DNC.] Hillary breaks left on trade - Fox News: “After being coy for weeks on her position, Hillary Clinton on Thursday clearly broke with President Obama on his trade push -- despite having supported the trade deal he wants as secretary of state. The now-Democratic presidential candidate made her position clear in an interview with veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston. After speaking at length about the uncertainty of what's in the deal and trade in general, Clinton was pressed for a yes-or-no answer on whether she'd vote for the package going through Congress. ‘At this point, probably not,’ she said.” Billionaire Dem donor tweaks Hillary - Nat Journal: “[D]eep-pocketed Democratic donor [Tom Steyer] who has pushed President Obama and Hillary Clinton on environmental issues took advantage of Pope Francis's climate-change encyclical to call on the next president to act on global warming.

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… In a culture that doesn’t flinch at grown women wearing ill-fitting yoga pants to travel on an airplane or adult men wearing tennis shoes to work in an office, what’s the point of “dressing up?” In a society where vulgarians are everywhere ascendant, what’s the point of being polite? And in a world where perfect strangers think nothing of calling adults, even their elders, only by their first names, what’s the point of courtesy? Being formal today is often seen as not just pointless but also priggish. So parents and others weary sentinels on the frontier between civilization and idiocracy often struggle with the “why” of keeping social order. In his commencement address to students at a California charter school, Prof. Harvey Mansfield provides the most powerful alternative to “because I said so.” And The Weekly Standard has made it available to you.

The 35th state is the only one born of the bloodshed of the Civil War, rending itself from the rest of Virginia when the mother state left the Union. Although incorrectly considered part of the South by the Census Bureau, West Virginia is very much Appalachian in nature, as reflected in the state motto: Montani Semper Liberi (“Mountaineers are Always Free”). Signed, sealed, delivered - This commitment to freedom is illustrated on the state seal, the most interesting part of which may be the most inconspicuous. A hat at the center of the two crossed rifles referred to as the “liberty cap” comes from ancient Rome, and was given to slaves when their owners granted them freedom. The liberty cap, called the Phrygian cap in ancient Rome, is also worn by the Magi that follow the star to the birth of Christ in most depictions, and is worn by the freedom statue at the top of the Capitol building in Washington. Any who celebrate the triumph of freedom over slavery ought to take a moment to observe West Virginia Day on Saturday. [For those who don’t know what a blessing it is to be a West Virginian, the indispensable Hoppy Kercheval has a brief meditation that is very much worth reading.] AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “I’ve argued for a long time that since we changed our laws on incarceration and involuntary hospitalization of the mentally ill, we’ve had an increase in these crimes.

And I think we really ought to show a little respect for some things which are not soluble by law.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"HILLARY’S BEST CASE SCENARIO GETS WORSE It looks increasingly like the best-case scenario for Hillary Clinton might be that someone from her inner circle will face serious consequences for their handling of classified information on her secret, home email server. This is “best case” because, as has been pointed out, the charges from an inspector general will be extremely hard to duck. So a good outcome at this point for Clinton on the allegations of mishandling sensitive documents as America’s chief diplomat might really be the ability to blame “staff error” for the breach. Yes, it will always be Clinton who took the risk of having a home brew server in her basement, but the blame for specific lapses could be pinned to others. Thanks to a sacrificial staffer, Clinton would still be able to say that she had not been prosecuted. But with the FBI snatching servers from contractors and Democrats getting jittery, running out the clock with a strategic retreat and staff scapegoat is not the recipe for restoring optimism in her campaign. There are practical considerations to having senior staffers’ necks on the block, as well. With news that Clinton’s right hand, Huma Abedin, is under scrutiny, things might not be so hip in Brooklyn these days. A campaign that struggles always with insularity and aloofness can’t improve with G-men running around and the “do not delete” orders hanging thick in the air. The Clinton campaign has a good way to deal with the steady barrage from House Republican investigators: call it a partisan witch hunt and dismiss any findings. But that won’t wash with the Obama Justice Department. Admitting staff incompetence would hardly be the end of the world for a presidential candidate, but Clinton is a different case. The recklessness of Clinton’s choice to use her secret email is an issue and so is her overall judgment. If Clinton wants to argue that she’s the experienced, steady hand for the job, this badly undercuts her claim. It’s no wonder that Democratic top dogs are reportedly becoming more receptive to the idea of a Joe Biden candidacy. It may be a needful thing. [But so Glamorous - Glamour magazine gushed over Abedin and other Clinton staffers in a lengthy photo essay. In a nod to bipartisanship, though, the famously liberal fashion mag found room for AshLee Strong and Kirsten Kukowski from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s inner circle.] Told you so - Speaker John Boehner and Benghazi Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., released a web video highlighting their months-long appeal for Hillary Clinton to turn over her emails and server. Video ends with the simply phrase “It’s about time.” PROTECTION IS THEIR MIDDLE NAME Times had been good for President Obama’s EPA. Just last week, the regulatory agency the president has leaned on to lock-in his global warming legacy pushed out a major new rule to drastically cut carbon emissions from power plants, a move heartily endorsed by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. But 48 hours after that rule was announced, an EPA contractor botched the clean-up of a Colorado mine dumping 3 million gallons of mustard-colored contaminated waste into the Animas River. EPA’s lackluster initial response, often poorly communicated and incomplete, has drawn heavy criticism from state, local and downstream states’ officials. And the incident has lawmakers questioning whether the agency that has steamrolled over the coal industry with its regulatory edicts is too focused on fulfilling the president’s future agenda at cost of its primary purpose. “This disaster emphasizes the need for the EPA to focus on fulfilling its existing responsibilities, instead of focusing its resources on imposing expensive new regulations that kill jobs and hurt family budgets.” – Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. [For the people - Looks like the donors to Obama’s presidential library may have some Romneysian tax tendencies…] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Fans of scary movies will be surprised to know that the king of their genre was actually a classic comedian. Alfred Hitchcock, born on this day in 1899 and set the gold standard of scary movies, was actually known for a dry, sharp, sense of humor. Hitchcock’s reputation as a “solemn-faced” Englishman, was matched with “making outrageous puns and ghoulish observations about the tales he told,” according to TIME reporter Richard Schickel in a 1980 piece. For example, Hitchcock responded to criticism of a comment he made about actors, “It has been said that I called actors cattle. I would never say such a rude, insulting thing. What I probably said was that all actors should be treated like cattle.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Jeb Bush’s, R-Fla.] campaign announced the new round of supporters Wednesday night. Among them: GOP elected officials, party leaders and activists from Woodbury County on the state’s western border to Scott County on its eastern edge, and from its most populous counties in central Iowa.” [Bush is in Iowa today for a National Security forum in Davenport, and the Polk County Summer Sizzle.] Carson gets real on race in Harlem - NYDN: “Republican presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson had some tough words for the Democrats — and for his fellow African-Americans — during a campaign swing through New York Wednesday. ‘Of course black lives matter,’ said Carson…‘What I feel, instead of people pointing fingers at each other, and just creating strife, what we need to be talking about is, how do we solve the problem in the black community of murder,’ Carson said.” Rand, Trump drama continues - Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., released a web video highlighting Donald Trump’s liberal past, and making the case that Trump is just like the Clintons with President Bill Clinton’s famous question asking the meaning of the word “is.” Trump wasted no time in responding to the video releasing a lengthy response to WaPo saying in part, “Rand Paul is doing so poorly in the polls he has to revert to old footage of me discussing positions I no longer hold.” Catching on to Carly - The NYT catches on to candidate Carly Fiorina’s longstanding pitch: that she would neuter Democratic attacks about a Republican war on women. “In a crowded Republican field, [Carly Fiorina] has delivered the most forceful and succinct denunciation of Mr. Trump’s comments, which sent a shudder through a party concerned that it would reinforce perceptions that it was increasingly out of touch with female voters. Now, many Republicans…are looking anew at Mrs. Fiorina…as the party’s weapon to counter the perception that it is waging a ‘war on women.’” [Fiorina participates in a Town Hall hosted by Iowa agribusiness mogul, Bruce Rastetter.] Cruz will attend Koch network event in Vegas - Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hits Las Vegas Friday for the “Road to Reform” policy series hosted by Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity. The forum’s topics will be health care an energy sectors. The event will be at the Red Rock Casino in downtown Las Vegas. The Judge’s Ruling: Hooks, not nets - Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano assesses the debate dust-up between Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., and Rand Paul, over NSA spying and Fourth Amendment protections. “The whole purpose of the probable cause standard is to force the government to focus on people it suspects of wrongdoing and leave the rest of us alone,” the judge rules, “Christie wants the feds to use a fish net. Paul argues that the Constitution requires the feds to use a fish hook.” Read it here.

WEIGHT A SECOND ITV News: “An airline is weighing passengers at check-in before allowing them to board to ensure ‘flight safety.’ Uzbekistan Airways announced on its website that passengers will be weighed with their hand luggage on special machines at the departure gate. The company promised customers confidentiality but the move could mean that heavier passengers are excluded from smaller planes or busy flights. In a message to passengers, the airline said: ‘…After passing check-in on flight and prior to boarding into the aircraft, we will suggest you to pass the procedure of weighing with the special weighing machine placed in the departure gate zone…’ The airline is seemingly following the example set by Samoan Air, which became the world's first airline to charge passengers according to their weight in 2013.

It was to have control of the emails, to keep them secret and thus to avoid the Freedom of Information Act and congressional oversight…Well that, doesn’t exist anymore as of last night when she said she’d be turning it over.

"So with Hillary Clinton ready to coast to the Democratic nomination, some of the media’s finest minds are examining how she might win the general election.","3424","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"The starting point for this electoral exercise is that Hillary is moving left. This has hardened from a theory to a glimmer to an undeniable fact. On issue after issue—gay marriage, immigration, criminal justice, voting rights—she has “evolved” toward a more liberal stance.","3425","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"Now because she happens to be married to a former president, the pundits can’t resist the comparison. Bill Clinton moved the Democratic Party toward the center, especially on such issues as welfare and budget-balancing; Hillary is moving toward the Elizabeth Warren wing.","3426","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"And yet Bill ran in 1992, when the Dems had lost three straight elections and were seen as too liberal to be trusted; Hillary will run in 2016, when the Dems have won two straight elections and are in tune with a public shift on some social issues.","3427","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"In the media’s binary world, there are two choices: Hillary can run left, energize her base and give up on swing voters, or she can run as more of a centrist and assume the base will fall into line.","3428","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"

"“Hillary Rodham Clinton appears to be dispensing with the nationwide electoral strategy that won her husband two terms in the White House and brought white working-class voters and great stretches of what is now red-state America back to Democrats.","3430","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"“Instead, she is poised to retrace Barack Obama’s far narrower path to the presidency: a campaign focused more on mobilizing supporters in the Great Lakes states and in parts of the West and South than on persuading undecided voters.”","3431","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"The piece goes on to question whether Hillary can replicate “the so-called Obama coalition of young, nonwhite and female voters,” given that blacks would naturally not be as energized as in 2008 and 2012. This also plays into a related debate: How many swing voters are left these days? In an era of polarization, more Democratic and Republican voters can’t stand the other party, leaving a dwindling pool in the middle.","3432","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"Of course, few things in politics are quite so black and white. Hillary might balance her liberal approach with more hawkish leanings on foreign policy. She might push certain issues that appeal to independents while whipping up the base by attacking Republicans on marriage and abortion.","3433","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"

"“America has always had tough partisan politics, but for most of its history, the system worked because it had leaders who could reframe debates, reorganize coalitions, build center-out alliances and reach compromises. Politics is broken today because those sorts of leaders have been replaced by highly polarizing, base-mobilizing politicians who hew to party orthodoxy, ignore the 38 percent of voters who identify as moderates and exacerbate partisanship and gridlock.","3435","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"“If Clinton decides to be just another unimaginative base-mobilizing politician, she will make our broken politics even worse.”","3436","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"

"“Reports of Hillary Clinton’s supposed lurch to the left have been greatly exaggerated, and there’s more to come…","3438","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"“Nothing Clinton is saying is outside the 2015 Democratic Party mainstream — or, more to the point, is likely to hurt her in a general election.","3439","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"“Sure, the Clinton campaign wants to placate the base. But if Clinton’s recent positions are pandering, this is pandering with a purpose, and without an obvious cost. She’s saying everything she can to make the left happy — without backing herself into a left-wing corner. Where’s the downside in chiding Republicans on voting rights?”","3440","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"The Times piece says Democrats are worried that if Hillary writes off a bunch of states in an effort to copy Obama’s Electoral College strategy, she’ll hurt the party’s efforts in Hill races. Maybe, but the truth is every campaign writes off a bunch of states as unwinnable as Election Day nears.","3441","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"
"Hillary could easily fall short. But if she wins on a liberal platform and winds up with a Republican Congress, we could be in for the same kind of gridlock that has plagued the last two presidents.","3442","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/11/hillarys-left-wing-strategy-media-say-shes-giving-up-on-swing-voters.html"

"This is ironic. Political bombshells don’t match the unburnished image of the affable, rumpled Illinois Republican. Hastert’s visage is about as far away from the torpedo bay as one can get in politics. Especially when one considers some of Hastert’s contemporaries: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and former Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas. Both were practically combustible.","3523","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"Yet bombshells define Hastert’s political life.","3524","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"It started with a political bombshell in December 1998. The event plucked the practically invisible lawmaker from a backwater leadership post and thrust him into the speaker’s suite just days later. Another political bombshell exploded in the fall of 2006 which sealed the end to Hastert’s career as speaker.","3525","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"And to cap it all, there was Thursday’s stunning federal indictment of the longest-serving Republican House speaker.","3526","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"Although Hastert is still a presence on Capitol Hill as a lobbyist, few thought he’d explode onto the front pages like this. Hastert appears shy. Soft-spoken. Even sheepish. Upon seizing the gavel in 1999, he often described himself as more of a “listener” than a “speaker.” Before this is all over, Hastert could very well score more press now than he ever did when he occupied the speaker’s chair.","3527","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"That’s what makes the indictment so staggering. Allegations worthy of FIFA. A federal grand jury contends Hastert lied to the FBI and skirted federal transaction rules for cash withdrawals – purportedly to obfuscate $3.5 million in hush money to “Individual A.” The indictment indicates that Hastert agreed to fork over the monumental sum “to compensate for and conceal his prior misconduct against Individual A.”","3528","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"

"The indictment continues that “Individual A has been a resident of Yorkville, Illinois and has known defendant John Dennis Hastert most of Individual A’s Life.” And the very first words of the indictment don’t focus on Hastert’s time as Speaker or as a Congressman. No. The indictment cryptically starts with the declaration that “from approximately 1965 to 1981, defendant JOHN DENNIS HASTERT was a high school teacher and coach in Yorkville, Illinois.”","3530","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"Speculation on Capitol Hill and in Illinois is utterly rampant about why prosecutors led with Hastert’s past as a coach and teacher as they try to decode a meaning.","3531","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"

"How didn’t this come out before instead of eight-and-a-half-years since Hastert left the speakership? Consider how much opposition research Democrats and political opponents conducted into Hastert? That’s stunning when one considers that Hastert presided over a House riddled by ethics and scandal. Criminal charges against DeLay who resigned, was convicted and then cleared. Charges involving some of DeLay’s aides: The conviction of former Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, who got caught in the web of superlobbyist Jack Abramoff and did time, the conviction of former Rep. Duke Cunningham, R-Calif., on corruption charges and the same for former Rep. Bill Jefferson D-La.","3533","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"To be clear, a court hasn’t yet tried Hastert. He hasn’t entered a plea nor offered a formal statement about the matter. But bombshells like these serve as temporal markers to Hastert’s career.","3534","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"The first bombshell was a doozy. Republicans nearly lost control of the House in the midterm elections of 1998. They overplayed their hand impeaching President Clinton in connection with his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Gingrich was already smarting from a government shutdown standoff with Clinton in 1995 and 1996 and never recovered. The GOP showed Gingrich the door after the midterms. In a November 1998, conclave, House Republicans tapped then-Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., to succeed Gingrich as speaker when the new Congress convened in January.","3535","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"

"Congressional Republicans forged ahead with plans to impeach Clinton. They voted on the articles in a rare Saturday session just days before Christmas. In another turn of events, the U.S. began pummeling Iraq with warheads as punishment for Baghdad defiantly violating internationally-imposed no-fly zones following the Gulf War. Then came the bombshell: even as the House voted to impeach Clinton for his misdeeds, word emerged that Livingston had been involved in an extra-marital affair of his own. In an emotional scene, the Louisiana Republican called on the president to resign – and then promised to step down himself. Livingston said he would not be a candidate for speaker in January.","3537","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"Republicans scrambled. They fretted about promoting the volatile DeLay to speaker. After hours of political intrigue and backchannel huddles, GOPers unveiled Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert as their speaker-designate for the new Congress in January.","3538","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"It was the equivalent of hypothetically promoting current Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., to the speaker’s post.","3539","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"The second bombshell came right before the midterm elections in the fall of 2006. Republicans were already on the ropes and in danger of losing control of the House. Then an explosion. Then-Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., resigned after it became known that he sent inappropriate text messages to teenage, male, House pages. In fact, one could trace the final implosion of the GOP majority to the final day of the congressional session before the election. During a round-the-clock session of Congress, the situation spiraled out of control, impaling Republicans.","3540","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"Hastert and some members of his team caught flak for their management of the page scandal. The Illinois Republican didn’t help his case when he appeared at a news conference at his home in Batavia, Ill., a few days after the Foley detonation.","3541","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"“Could we have done it better? Could the Page Board have handled it better? In retrospect, probably yes. But at that time, what we knew and what we acted upon was what we had,” said Hastert.","3542","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"Democrats pounced. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was already crowing about the litany of ethics lapses impairing Republicans. Foley just contributed to the narrative. Pelosi christened it a “culture of corruption.”","3543","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"Reporters peppered Hastert with questions about whether he was fit to lead the party should the GOP retain the majority.","3544","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"“Ultimately any time that a person has to, as a leader, be on the hot seat and he is a detriment to the party, there ought to be a change. I became speaker in a situation like that,” said Hastert at the time. “I don’t think that’s the case. I said I haven’t done anything wrong.”","3545","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"Hastert then proceeded to talk about tax cuts, spending reductions and fighting terrorism.","3546","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"

"Democrats gained 31 seats, dispatched the GOP to the minority, finished off Hastert’s speakership and anointed Pelosi as his successor.","3548","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"And now there is this bombshell. Guilty or innocent, this bombshell will serve as a bookend to Hastert’s career. Just like the one which propelled him to the speakership in 1999.","3549","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"
"There weren’t a lot of bombshells back when Hastert taught school and coached wrestling in Yorkville, Ill. In 1976, Hastert’s wrestling squad won the state title.

"That was before Hastert wound up in politics, matriculating from school teacher to speaker. Hastert never really earned much money teaching and in public service. That came once he left Congress. It could explain why “Individual A” negotiated with Hastert circa 2010 – a point where the Illinois Republican may have developed some resources after leaving Congress.","3551","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/29/indictment-latest-flare-up-in-ex-speaker-hastert-bombshell-filled-career.html"

And tucked away in the Army Library’s inventory of film footage is an entry labeled “Baltimore riots, Baltimore, Maryland, 04/07/1968 - 04/09/1968.” This covers the period shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the National Archives’ summary of the footage reads, in part:","3645","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"

"Then, as now, one can observe in the commentary on Baltimore the emergence of two distinct camps: the Literalists and the Impressionists. As in art, the Literalists embrace realism and regard both life and the larger universe as reducible to particulars: Objective facts can be established, any scene can be rendered in minute and unfailingly accurate detail.","3648","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"In the theater of sadness that was West Baltimore this week, the Literalist camp paradoxically united two rather disparate groups of onlookers: those who remained fixed on the facts surrounding the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, including chief prosecutor Marilyn Mosby, a Democrat, and many activists in the African-American community; and those who, like former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, vocally decried the lawlessness in the streets and demanded a more robust response by law enforcement.","3649","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"“It is my job to examine and investigate the evidence of each case,” Mosby said when, on Friday, she announced the indictment of six Baltimore police officers in Gray’s death.","3650","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"“Here is the rule I had with my police department and my police commissioner,” Giuliani recalled on “Hannity” on April 28. “First rock, get arrested. Second rock, get arrested.” Despite their divergent worldviews, both Mosby and Giuliani, himself a former prosecutor, adopted the strict Literalist view, in the sense that they were apt to see the action unfolding in Baltimore in concrete, factual, even numerical terms. Every victim of police brutality and every lawbreaker in the rioting – “each case,” as Mosby put it, and the thrower of even a single rock, as Giuliani put it – must swiftly be brought before the bar of justice.","3651","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"The Impressionists on the scene in Baltimore, however, are more inclined to move beyond the specifics, to see before their eyes something more than a demolished CVS. The Impressionists eschew the particular for generalization; they paint in broad strokes and speak not of specific cases but of sweeping historical dynamics and trends.","3652","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"“It has nothing to do with West Baltimore or this particular corner in Baltimore,” said Democratic City Councilman Nick Mosby, husband of Marilyn, to my intrepid Fox News colleague Leland Vittert, amid the final flashes of smoke and looting on Monday night. “What it is, is young folks of the community showing decades old anger, frustration, for a system that's failed them. I mean, it's bigger than Freddie Gray. This is about the social economics of poor urban America.”","3653","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"Both sets of onlookers of the moral decay on display this week, the Literalists and the Impressionists, are indeed recording the Baltimore Riots of 2015 with strong doses of accuracy. Where some see the commission of thousands of discrete criminal acts, many captured on video, others peer through an invisible veil to glimpse the effects, as Mosby put it, of “a system that’s failed.”","3654","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"If the Impressionists are correct, then those interested in redress of Baltimore’s multiple ills will show a keen interest in more information about how and why the system that failed wound up doing so in such spectacular fashion. Once again, the enterprise could be guided by a Literalist point of view or by a more Impressionist sensibility; but in the more neutral terms of political science – a discipline that employs a blend of science and art, and in which this writer earned his bachelor’s degree at The Johns Hopkins University in 1980s Baltimore – a natural starting point for investigation would be the governments of Baltimore and Maryland.","3655","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"Of those governments, perhaps the most salient fact to the objective political scientist, tasked with anatomizing the failed system, would be that both governments have long effectively functioned as one-party systems. Baltimore last had a Republican mayor, Theodore M. McKeldin, in 1967. (A wire photograph from April 1966 captured McKeldin, a bear of a man, chatting amiably with Dr. King in Baltimore, two years before the civil rights leader’s assassination in Memphis.) Maryland elected its incumbent Republican governor, Larry Hogan, in November – but that made Hogan only the second GOP governor in the Old Line State since 1969.","3656","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"Incumbent mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, a Democrat, deals with a city council comprised 100 percent of fellow Democrats. Other important power blocs in the political and civic life of Baltimore are likewise controlled by Democrats, such as educational institutions and public-sector unions.","3657","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"In systemic terms, one-party control is generally considered unhealthy and to many eyes the record of one-party government in Baltimore, measured in the usual societal metrics, demonstrates as much with crystalline clarity.","3658","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"Nor is scarce funding necessarily the issue. According to data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Education, Baltimore in Fiscal Year 2012 spent an average of $15,287 on each elementary and secondary school student, an investment that ranked Baltimore third, behind New York and Boston, on the list of top spenders among the country’s 100 largest school systems by enrollment. And yet recent studies have shown only 16 percent of Baltimore’s eighth graders score at or above grade level in reading, only 13 percent for math.","3659","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"With Baltimore’s rates of violent crime and poverty also far worse than the national average, far worse than the numbers Baltimore posted fifty years ago – before American taxpayers spent an estimated $16 trillion in the war on poverty and other Great Society initiatives – some see the “system” that Nick Mosby lamented as having “failed” Baltimore’s young people as one that offers discernible lessons for public policy and how society can best tackle what Mosby called “the social economics of poor urban America.” In short, they see – in a highly Impressionistic way, of course – liberalism itself on trial in Baltimore.","3660","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"“It’s a group of politicians that believe that the answers to everything lies in ever bigger government and ever more government spending,” said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the right-of-center Cato Institute think tank in Washington, of the political class that presided over Baltimore’s long- and short-term deterioration. “We understand the basics about how to get out of poverty. Number one, for example, has to do with a good education….We’re spending a huge amount of money on schools, not educating students, and you end up with a lot of kids in poverty.”","3661","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"Juan Williams, the left-leaning journalist, author, and Fox News contributor, noted the “white flight” that had taken place in Baltimore over the last several decades, a “larger, racial dynamic” that he said hastened the deterioration of the cities into “basically the hole in the middle of a prosperous doughnut, oftentimes surrounded by very well-to-do suburbs.” Yet the communities that remained in Baltimore, even as the city shed one-third of its white population, starting in 1960, remain entitled to effective governance, Williams emphasized. “They still have a right to expect from their politicians results and accountability, and here we would have to admit to failure in terms of Democratic Party politics – and policies.”","3662","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"One elected official in Baltimore rejected this indictment of liberalism running through the commentary of recent days. City Councilman Carl Stokes told Fox News: “We can go to other cities that are conservative, that have been run by other parties, and I'm going to tell you, you're going to find places where things are bad also.”","3663","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"In fact, because Democrats tend to run most major American cities, examples to support Stokes’ claim are not easy to find. In Indianapolis, where the population exceeds Baltimore’s by about 25 percent and the two-term mayor is a Republican, homicides have surged to some of their highest numbers in a decade; however the city council is narrowly controlled, 15-14, by Democrats. And in Rockford, Illiniois, where the population of 150,000 is not even one-quarter of Baltimore’s, the poverty rate equals Baltimore’s and Rockfordians experience more violent crimes per 100,000 residents than all but seven other cities. Rockford’s mayor, however, is an independent and the city council is narrowly controlled, seven to six, by Republicans.","3664","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"
"Almost 88 percent of Baltimore voted for President Obama in 2012. And earlier this year, Obama indicated that he has in turn been impressed by the governance he has observed in Baltimore – at least since 2011, when Mayor Rawlings-Blake assumed office. In remarks to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in the East Room in January, Obama singled her out by name and said he was “proud” of her.","3665","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/analysis-in-baltimore-unrest-liberalism-on-trial.html"

"FIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: NEW POLL SHOWS HILLARY WAY UNDER WATER IN SWING STATES Pro-GOP group American Crossroads had pollsters Vox Populi survey voters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia. This month’s results found only 38 percent of voters had a favorable opinion of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while 53 percent had an unfavorable view. Clinton trailed a generic Republican candidate by 8 points. Fifty-eight percent of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that Clinton “will say or do anything” to be president. Additionally, 56 percent of respondents found her at least somewhat untrustworthy, and 37 percent thought she was definitely hiding something about the 2012 Benghazi attack with another 21 percent probably hiding something. [GOP-opposition research group America Rising unveiled its sister group, AR2, on Tuesday.] Clinton says Democrats should run on climate change - National Journal: “Hillary Clinton isn’t afraid to talk about global warming—and she wants her fellow Democrats to join her. In closed-door meetings with House and Senate Democrats Tuesday, Clinton jumped at the chance to discuss the hot-button topic in political terms, numerous lawmakers said. Clinton delivered a clear message: Democrats must convince the American public that action to combat Earth's rising temperatures is urgent, and her party can make that case by tailoring their message to different kinds of voters.” Clinton family friend attacks Hillary on bank breakup - Former classmate to both Clintons, economist Robert Reich goes after Hillary for her resistance to the Glass-Steagall Act. Reich posted a column on his website stating: “Hillary Clinton won’t propose reinstating a bank break-up law known as the Glass-Steagall …This is a big mistake. It’s a mistake politically because people who believe Hillary Clinton is still too close to Wall Street will not be reassured by her position on Glass-Steagall.” [Poll: Hillary loses a step or two - Hillary Clinton’s sizable lead has been trimmed a bit according to a new Monmouth University poll. Clinton saw support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters drop six points since June to 51 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., still a distance second at 17 percent, bumped up 5 points from his June showing.] O’Malley pushes further on immigration than Obama - TIME: “Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley on Tuesday called for a broad sweep of executive actions to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation and detention, touting his work as governor of Maryland and saying he would go further than President Obama as he seeks to attract the support of Hispanic voters.” DEMS WILL PAY 2016 PRICE FOR IRAN Vox: “Obama already has vowed to veto planned legislation blocking the deal. That means he will rely on just one-third of either the House or Senate voting with him to save it. He needs a majority of Democrats but only a minority of either chamber. That paradigm — Republicans uniformly opposed and Democrats divided — will make the agreement a tougher sell to the broader public than if it had bipartisan majority support or even full backing from Obama’s Democrats. ‘The easier vote for most us will be no,’ said one House Democrat who is inclined to back the president. Members don’t tend to lose their seats for voting against the president when his position ends up winning, the lawmaker explained.” Happy place - David Drucker points out that the issue is not so complicated for Republicans, quoting GOP wise man Ed Rollins: “Bad issue for the country; good issue for Republicans.” Rubio group launches television second ad on Iran - The Conservative Solutions Project, a group backing Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., released a second ad Tuesday set to air on national cable stations. The ad called “Lessons of History” highlights Rubio as the leader against President Obama’s Iran deal.

Rand opposes final Iran deal - NYT: “Senator Rand Paul, the White House hopeful from Kentucky who has supported negotiations with Iran, was silent on the historic development for most of the day on Tuesday before explaining on Twitter why he opposed it.” [Chicken salad out of… - Hoover Institution’s Kori Schake offers her prescriptions for making the best of the Iran deal.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… History Channel: “On this day in 1903, the newly formed Ford Motor Company takes its first order from Chicago dentist Ernst Pfenning: an $850 two-cylinder Model A automobile with a tonneau (or backseat). The car, produced at Ford’s plant on Mack Street (now Mack Avenue) in Detroit, was delivered to Dr. Pfenning just over a week later. Henry Ford had built his first gasoline-powered vehicle–which he called the Quadricycle–in a workshop behind his home in 1896, while working as the chief engineer for the main plant of the Edison Illuminating Company in Detroit. After making two unsuccessful attempts to start a company to manufacture automobiles before 1903, Ford gathered a group of 12 stockholders, including himself, to sign the papers necessary to form the Ford Motor Company in mid-June 1903.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

The Federal Election Commission will release today the details of the second-quarter fundraising by 2016 candidates. With Jeb Bush in his own $114 million campaign-plus-super PAC fundraising zip code, and Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio rounding out the top tier at $51 million and $43 million respectively, the key question is what will Scott Walker’s filing tell. Though his official kickoff was just last week, the Wisconsin governor will need to show he can compete in the top money group. Despite solid poll number in early states Walker is bound to suffer some down beats which means having sufficient hay in the loft to push through a heavily front-loaded primary calendar. Walker will face a tough climb if he falls back into the rest of the pack, none of whom has reported more than $17 million in combined campaign/PAC dollars, several bringing in considerably less. [Who’s rising fastest? Who’s spending fastest? WSJ goes granular on what to watch out for in second quarter filings.] Walker picks fight with Feds over food stamp drug testing - Chicago Tribune: “The budget Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed on Sunday contains language requiring food stamp recipients to undergo drug screening. If they fail the screen they must go through drug testing and treatment to remain eligible for the benefit. The lawsuit alleges that federal food stamp officials warned the state in May that federal law bars the state from implementing any drug testing for food stamp recipients. The law prohibits a state agency from imposing eligibility standards for food stamps that aren't consistent with standards set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary.” Freakout, day two - Walker’s support for the Boy Scouts’ policy to welcome gay scouts but ban gay scoutmasters was greeted by a full-scale frenzy on the left.

Jeb Bush, R-Fla., rolled out his South Carolina campaign committee today.

Read the full list here. Jeb tees off on Trump - “Whether it’s Donald Trump or Barack Obama, their rhetoric of divisiveness is wrong…A Republican will never win by striking fear in people’s hearts. A Republican can win and will win if we have an aspirational message that gives people hope that their lives will be better if we apply conservative principles the right way,” said Bush in Iowa on Tuesday.

John Kasich, a likely Republican presidential candidate, on Tuesday defended his decision to accept federal dollars for a Medicaid expansion as part of ObamaCare…He defended the decision as rooted in Biblical teaching of helping the ‘downtrodden,’ and he pushed back against others in his party that panned Obama’s Medicaid expansion as bloating the size of the federal government. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is the only other Republican governor in the field to expand Medicaid.” Christie’s special announcement - Gov.

READ THIS Charles Hurt puts Atticus Finch in perspective: “Perhaps the Atticus Finch of ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ is the very same racist who later emerges in ‘Go Set A Watchman.’ The Atticus of Mockingbird does not really care for black people. He is not some kind of activist. He is no part of any movement. This Atticus Finch, the one we have loved for so long, is nothing more than a slave to the law. He loves only justice. And when he saw a man who was wrongly accused, he didn’t see a black man or a white girl. He simply saw a miscarriage of justice and fought to right it.” CANADIAN HOLES ELEVATED CBC: “Excusez-moi? Many Fredericton drivers can be excused if they are getting lost in translation thanks to some road construction signs popping up across the city. New Brunswick is Canada’s only officially bilingual province, so it’s not unusual to see road signs in both French and English. But sometimes signs translated directly from English to French can cause unintended — and humorous —problems. That’s what is happening in Fredericton, where signs warning of raised manholes are causing some confusion among drivers. The yellow warning sign reads: ‘Caution: Raised manholes/Attention: Trous d’homme sur éléves.’ The direct translation suggests that ‘men’s holes are over-elevated.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “Even worse is the final capitulation, which was a giving in to a lifting of the embargo on ballistic missiles and conventional arms. We just heard Kerry say why didn’t you negotiate for U.S. hostages held there and he says it’s not a nuclear thing. Well, conventional is the opposite of nuclear that was not to be discussed at all, it was thrown in by the Iranians and the Russians at the last moment and we caved on that.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"This triggered concerns that the campaign-finance regulator could try targeting YouTube videos and other posts to make sure their creators file spending reports.

"GOP members of the commission, in response, cited an ""Internet exemption"" dating back to 2006 that spares free web videos from FEC regulation.

"When the administration was called out by immigration activists for deporting 2 million people and dividing hundreds of thousands of families, Obama and his surrogates hid behind the claim that the majority of those removed were criminals. White House strategists must have figured out early on that most Americans — even many Hispanics who support immigration reform — would have less sympathy for hoodlums than housekeepers.","3811","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"The strategy became to have administration officials such as Janet Napolitano, the former Homeland Security Secretary, and Cecilia Munoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council, publicize the claim that — for instance, in 2011 — as many as 55 percent of those deported that year had, besides entering the country illegally, also committed crimes once they got here.","3812","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"The spinners would have gotten away with it if researchers with the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, hadn’t crunched the numbers and found that, in 2011, only about 14.9 percent of the people deported were actually charged with a criminal offense. The other 85.1 percent were folks who were trying to earn a living, working as nannies or gardeners. The typical Obama deportee wasn’t a murderer or rapist but a lady selling tamales outside a supermarket without a permit, a battered wife picked up after calling the police on her husband, or the father of a child with terminal cancer. You can see why the administration didn’t want to advertise the true details of its deportation record, since it doesn’t exactly cover the White House in glory.","3813","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"Obama is fond of one phrase in particular, in discussing Mexican immigrants: “gang banger.” He uses it as a crutch.","3814","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"During the 2012 presidential election, Obama said this during a debate: “What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families. And that's what we've done.”","3815","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"And just a few weeks ago, at a town hall in Madison, Wisconsin, Obama responded to a question about whether Obamacare would be expanded to cover “sick migrant people” by saying this: “We should not be encouraging illegal immigration. What we should be doing is setting up a smart, legal immigration system that doesn’t separate families, but does focus on making sure that people who are dangerous, people who are gang-bangers or criminals — that we’re deporting them as quickly as possible.”","3816","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"

"Now Trump is singing Obama’s song and adding a few verses of his own. The mouthy mogul wants to get tough on Mexico by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and sending our neighbor the bill. He also says that, in 2003, instead of going into Iraq, “we should have invaded Mexico.”","3818","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"Been there, done that too. Even though he's one of the biggest landlords in the United States, Trump apparently hasn't considered the consequences if Mexico retaliates for the wall stunt by collecting rent from the millions of inhabitants of the eight states in the Southwest stolen by the United States in 1848 while the young nation was intoxicated by Manifest Destiny.","3819","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"

"That seems a little steep. Trump is supposed to be a master negotiator. If he is really that desperate for more illegal immigrants to help Americans cut their lawns, cook their food, clean their homes, pick their vegetables, and wipe their kids’ noses, he should just ask for those additional immigrants nicely. I’m sure Mexico will give him a better price.","3821","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"
"Trump is a dream come true for Democrats, who prefer to get the Hispanic vote the old fashioned way: by not earning it. Hispanic outreach is sticky for Democrats because they’d rather spend their campaign dollars to court soccer moms and because African-Americans complain about playing second fiddle to a group that they perceive to be the new kid on the block. So the safest path for Democrats is to go before Hispanic voters with a simple message: “We may be mediocre but at least we’re not Republicans.”","3822","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/18/immigration-how-barack-obama-gave-birth-to-donald-trump.html"

"The former governor of Maryland told reporters that the debate schedule – trimmed to six from more than 25 in 2008 – represents a circling of wagons around Clinton, who is clearly ahead of her Democratic challengers. He is joined by fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is also calling for more debates.","3854","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/fellow-dems-blast-dnc-for-coddling-hillary-in-debate-schedule.html"

"“Hillary is not known for debates, she does much better in small groups,” said Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall Poll in Pennsylvania. “She does not do well in big arenas, she is not compelling.

So she speaks more to selective audiences.”","3858","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/fellow-dems-blast-dnc-for-coddling-hillary-in-debate-schedule.html"

"“We are thrilled to announce the schedule and locations for our Democratic primary debates,” said DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Thursday. “These six debates will not only give caucus goers and primary voters ample opportunity to hear from our candidates about their vision for our country’s future, they will highlight the clear contrast between the values of the Democratic Party which is focused on strengthening the middle class versus Republicans who want to pursue out of touch and out of date policies.”","3862","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/fellow-dems-blast-dnc-for-coddling-hillary-in-debate-schedule.html"

"Sanders’ campaign said Thursday that it was disappointed with the results. “But I am not surprised,” he said in a statement. “At a time when many Americans are demoralized about politics and have given up on the political process, I think it's imperative that we have as many debates as possible -- certainly more than six.

"2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney was said to have been banged up so badly by his fellow primary candidates during their 19 official debates that it hurt him in the general election, which he lost to President Obama.

"“Let’s be honest we don’t know whether (the debate schedule) has anything to do with Clinton stumbling and her current problems in the polls,” Madonna said, pointing to her creeping unfavorable ratings and the private email scandal. “The other problem in these debates is they can become a referendum on Obama,” and Clinton’s relationship to him could boomerang on her. The leadership could be mindful of that.","3871","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/fellow-dems-blast-dnc-for-coddling-hillary-in-debate-schedule.html"
"It can’t hurt O’Malley and Sanders to push back, Madonna added. “They need to take the gloves off at some point, and challenge her,” he said. “People in the same party need to give people a reason to vote for them, and talking about their differences, too, just like they did (in the Republican debate) last night.”","3872","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/fellow-dems-blast-dnc-for-coddling-hillary-in-debate-schedule.html"
