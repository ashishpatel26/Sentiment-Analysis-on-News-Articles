"Though no conclusive answers are available about how people arrive at their sexual orientation, there is general consensus that choice does not play a significant role. Studies have found genetics likely plays a role, as may hormonal exposure while in utero. As for prison inmates changing sexual orientation, very little research has been conducted on the subject. One small, non-representative study that did not follow inmates after release did find some inmates reported shifting their orientation while in prison.","13","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"

"Carson went on to say that his point about prisons ""thwarts"" the notion that being gay is not a choice. In fact, the scientific community remains unsure of exactly what determines sexual orientation, but choice is not a significant factor.","26","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"
"According to the American Psychological Association: ""Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.""","27","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"
"Clinton Anderson, a psychologist and the director of APA's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Concerns Office, told us in an email that surveys have borne out this notion that very few feel any choice in sexual orientation. He pointed to one such survey that found 88% of gay men and 68% of lesbians reported having ""no choice at all"" about their sexual orientation. Combined with those who said they had a ""small amount of choice,"" those proportions rise to 95% and 84%.","28","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"
"Anderson said the APA does ""not currently take any position on the biological evidence,"" but added that there is ""substantial"" evidence regarding biology and sexual orientation. For example, there is likely a genetic component, based upon studies of the families of homosexual men. In one such study, published in the journal Science in 1993, it was more likely that maternal uncles and male cousins of gay men were also gay; that study found it was more than 99% likely ""that at least one subtype of male sexual orientation is genetically influenced.""","29","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"
"Another study, published in 2004 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, a journal on biological sciences published by the United Kingdom's national academy of sciences, looked at 98 homosexual and 100 heterosexual men and more than 4,000 of their relatives. The study found that female maternal relatives of homosexual men have higher fecundity — reproductive rate, or a measure of how many children someone has or can have — than female maternal relatives of heterosexuals. This could help explain what has been considered a sort of evolutionary paradox, that a genetic trait for homosexuality could be passed down.","30","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"
"This finding has been confirmed elsewhere, including by a 2012 study in the open-access journal PLoS One. In that paper, the authors wrote that ""the total female fecundity was significantly higher in homosexual than heterosexual probands"" — essentially the people being studied — ""thus compensating for the reduced fecundity of homosexuals.""","31","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"
"Another 2012 study, published in the Quarterly Review of Biology, suggested that ""epigenetic"" effects occurring while in the womb may determine sexual orientation. This means that it isn't the genes themselves dictating sexual orientation, but which genes or parts of genes are activated or expressed — something that can change based on levels of hormones to which a fetus is exposed.","32","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"

"Very little research has been done specifically on changes to sexual orientation while incarcerated. One relevant study was published in 2013 in the Prison Journal by Lauren Gibson and Christopher Hensley, both of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Their work included 142 male inmates incarcerated in a single maximum-security prison. The inmates were asked to retrospectively characterize their sexual orientation before incarceration, and to characterize it again ""today,"" along with a variety of other questions on sexual activity and other factors.","35","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"
"Of the 142 inmates, 24 reported a change in sexual orientation from before incarceration to the present. In total, 75% of those who changed orientation changed from straight to bisexual, 12.5% changed from bisexual to straight, and 4.2% each changed from bisexual to gay, from gay to straight, and from gay to bisexual. And again, these represented only 16.9% of all the inmates who responded to the survey, and only 18% of those asked to participate (800 in total) actually responded.","36","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"
"Hensley, the coauthor of the paper, told us in a phone interview that this was indeed a small sample and should not be considered representative of the larger population. He also said that he has not followed up with these inmates to check what their sexual orientation was after release from prison, and that he is unaware of any studies that have examined sexual orientation before entering and after leaving prison.","37","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"

"Within that apology, however, Carson made another mistake. After noting that he is a ""doctor trained in multiple fields of medicine,"" he said: ""We do know, however, that we are always born male and female."" As a doctor, he should know that strict male-female dichotomy does not reflect the current understanding of gender given the approximately one in 4,500 children born with disorders of sex development, also known as intersex disorders.","40","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/06/fact-check-ben-carson-sexual-orientation/24497343/"

"The large number of Republicans who plan to run for president face a daunting problem. They will have to spend huge amounts of time and money just to introduce themselves to voters.

"On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, who announced her bid for the presidency Sunday in a two-minute video posted on her campaign website, faces no such problem.

"On the plus side, she brings more top-level experience — in the White House, Congress and foreign policy — than her rivals put together.

"But with more experience comes more baggage. Clinton's record as first lady, senator, candidate and Cabinet member leaves her with a long trail of votes and controversies that cause a good chunk of the electorate — 44% in the CNN poll — to view her unfavorably.

"For starters, she will have to show that she can run a disciplined campaign. Her 2008 bid for the Democratic nomination was a mess of the first order.

"Clinton will also have to convince voters that she understands the importance of openness in government. During her husband's first term, her secrecy-shrouded health care task force released an unworkable, overly complex plan that makes Obamacare look like an exercise in government restraint. More recently, her decision to run her email from a private server while she was secretary of State raised new concerns about her commitment to transparency.","371","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-presidential-candidate-editorials-debates/25592677/"

"Benjamin Franklin once famously said that nothing is certain in this world except death and taxes. Thankfully, the federal policy that combines the two by taxing estates when a loved one passes away is close to extinction. Enacted nearly 100 years ago, the death tax places a significant burden on families that want to achieve the American dream — securing a better future for their children — by passing down a small business or a family farm from one generation to the next. The policy is also widely unpopular, with nearly 70% of Americans saying they want to see it repealed permanently.","6:56 a.m. EDT April 16, 2015","423","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/16/death-tax-abolish-thune-column/25816117/"
"Repealing the death tax restores fairness for American families, and is a step toward a 21st century, pro-growth tax code. Now, with support growing in both the House and Senate, Congress has the opportunity to do just that. This week, the House will vote on a death tax repeal bill introduced by Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and co-sponsored by Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, chairman of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the conservative caucus of House Republicans. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. has led the repeal effort in the Senate by sponsoring the companion bill in the Senate, the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015, as well as an amendment to the budget supporting its repeal, which recently passed on a bipartisan vote of 54-46.","424","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/16/death-tax-abolish-thune-column/25816117/"
"Proponents of the death tax often argue that it only impacts the wealthiest Americans, but this is simply not true. In practice, the death tax hits hardest those families that run small businesses or operate farms, with devastating results. A 2012 report from the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) called the death tax ""an overwhelming cause of the dissolution of family businesses"" and ""a significant hindrance to entrepreneurial activity."" This is because families that have spent a lifetime working hard — and paying taxes — to build a successful business may lack the liquid assets to meet the federal government's steep death tax rate. The only way to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service is to break up the business or parcel off the family farm to pay the tax liability. The federal government should not be punishing families for their hard work. Instead, we should promote strong family businesses that contribute to our vibrant economy and withstand the test of time.","425","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/16/death-tax-abolish-thune-column/25816117/"
"Ironically, by discouraging investment, the death tax hurts the U.S. economy and, according to some studies, actually decreases long-term tax revenue. Since its inception in 1916, the death tax has cost the U.S. economy more than $1 trillion in capital accumulation, or 3.2% of total capital stock, according to the Republican staff of the JEC. Less capital formation means slower economic growth, which results in decreased tax revenue for the federal government. The death tax gives us the ugly consequences of breaking up family businesses without any discernible benefit in terms of tax revenue. Repealing this senseless tax would allow family businesses to grow over multiple generations and improve the U.S. economy in the process. A recent study by the Tax Foundation found that repeal of the death tax would increase the U.S. capital stock by 2.2%, boost the economy, create 139,000 jobs and eventually increase federal revenue.","426","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/16/death-tax-abolish-thune-column/25816117/"
"In fact, the tax hurts America at home and abroad. The U.S. death tax rate is the fourth highest among developed nations and puts American family businesses at a competitive disadvantage with competitors across the globe. The average death tax rate for counties in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is 15%, but the U.S. rate is a much higher 40%. According to the Tax Foundation, since 2000, 11 countries have repealed their death tax entirely, including Sweden and Norway. While these countries turn toward encouraging economic investment, President Obama has proposed taking America in the exact opposite direction. The president's fiscal year 2016 budget included a second death tax that would effectively raise America's rate to nearly 60% — the second highest rate in the world.","427","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/16/death-tax-abolish-thune-column/25816117/"
"This Congress is committed to sending a death tax repeal bill to the president's desk. We urge President Obama to listen to the American people, who overwhelmingly want to see this destructive tax abolished, and to work with Congress. By repealing this unpopular tax, we can help American families, protect our farms and family-owned businesses and grow our nation's economy.","428","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/16/death-tax-abolish-thune-column/25816117/"

"Accepting the mantra that ""no deal is better than a bad deal,"" Netanyahu offers the alternative of insisting on better terms and increasing the pressure on the Iranians until a more credible agreement is reached. He does not fear the Iranians walking away from the negotiating table because, in his words, they need the deal more than the U.S. and its partners.","468","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/04/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-deal-ross/24362743/"
"While the Obama administration is unlikely to accept his argument that it should simply negotiate better and harder, it should not dismiss the concerns Netanyahu raises about the emerging deal. Indeed, the administration's argument that there is no better alternative than the deal it is negotiating begs the question of whether the prospective agreement is acceptable.","469","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/04/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-deal-ross/24362743/"
"And, here, the administration needs to explain why the deal it is trying to conclude actually will prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons for the lifetime of the agreement and afterwards. It needs to explain why the combinationof the number and quality of centrifuges, their output, and the ship-out from Iran of enriched uranium will, in fact, ensure that the break-out time for the Iranians will not be less than one year. Either this combination adds up or it does not, but there should be an explicit answer to Netanyahu's charge that Iran will be able to break out much more quickly.","470","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/04/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-deal-ross/24362743/"
"Similarly, there should be an answer on how the verification regime is going to work to ensure that we can detect, even in a larger nuclear program, any Iranian violation of the agreement. The issue of verification is critical not just because Iran's past clandestine nuclear efforts prove it cannot be trusted, but also because the administration has made a one-year break-out time the key measure of success of the agreement. But we can be certain that Iran will be one year away from being able to produce a bomb's supply of weapons-grade uranium only if we can detect what they are doing when they do it.","471","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/04/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-deal-ross/24362743/"
"Obviously, detection is only part of the equation. We cannot wait to determine what we will do about violations when they happen. Iran must know in advance what the consequences are for violations, particularly if we want to deter them in the first place. This clearly goes to the heart of Netanyahu's concerns: If he had high confidence that we would impose harsh consequences in response to Iranian violations, including the use of force if we caught Iran dashing toward a weapon, he would be less fearful of the agreement he believes is going to emerge.","472","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/04/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-deal-ross/24362743/"
"But he does not see that, and he fears that, as with past arms control agreements, we will seek to discuss violations and not respond to them until it is too late.

"Of course, there are important facts missing from those declarations of victory. The ""fix"" legislation tackling the horrific and massively controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana — like the similar attempt that advanced in Arkansas — did not explicitly protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people from discrimination at the state level, though it limited some of the damage of the original legislation.

"Petraeus has company.

"Tony Blair illustrates yet another case of failing up. The former U.K. prime minister is reportedly being eased out as so-called Quartet envoy to the Middle East, representing the United States, the United Nations, Russia and the European Union. Blair has faced controversy since becoming envoy the day he left office in 2007, notably accusations that he was mixing a fast-sprawling business empire with diplomacy, or, at best, putting dealmaking over peacemaking. One might say this defies the idea that the powerful fail up. But consider how long Blair has been envoy: nearly eight years. That's after reports early on of eye-rolling regarding his Quartet dealings. As one headline recently put it, ""Good Riddance, Tony Blair — you've been tolerated as Middle East envoy for far too long.""","538","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/24/david-petraeus-scandal-classified-information-column/70332612/"

"It's not yet clear what exactly triggered Blair's comedown. But in terms of failing up, there has been one clear success in forcing a perennial player down a notch. One might think that with his track record, both in government and as president of Harvard, former Treasury secretary Larry Summers would have been the last person under consideration in July 2013 to be the next Federal Reserve chairman. He consistently opposed regulating exotic derivatives in the 1990s, which most observers now blame for detonating the economy. And he embodied the problem of public servants who seem too close with the industry they're supervising — in his case, Wall Street. But President Obama clearly leaned on Summers during the crash.","540","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/24/david-petraeus-scandal-classified-information-column/70332612/"
"Critics rose up against a possible Summers nomination and, uncharacteristically, Summers withdrew his name. The economist that many favored, Janet Yellen, prevailed.

As I have found, this kind of activity often lies far beyond the limits of accountability, the bulwark of democratic society. So expect to see him for years to come. And not on the links, either. In one of those glossy profiles before the 2012 scandal, a reporter hinted towards a quieter post-military life, which, in the writer's assessment, ""startled"" Petraeus.

"Tuesday, as promised, the new Congress is sending the White House legislation that would approve the Keystone XL pipeline. This project will support tens of thousands of American jobs. It will bolster the nation's infrastructure and energy security. And it enjoys a broad base of support from Republicans and Democrats, labor unions and small business owners, not to mention an overwhelming majority of Americans.","1:05 p.m. EST February 24, 2015","581","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-veto-pipeline-politics-energy-jobs-column/23882407/"
"Keystone is a no-brainer in every way, but the White House says the president will veto this jobs bill. Americans deserve to know why, and what a veto would mean.","582","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-veto-pipeline-politics-energy-jobs-column/23882407/"
"The White House's recommendation of a veto has nothing to do with the aforementioned merits of the project. Instead, the administration claims the bill will ""cut short"" the process for approving the project. We disagree. If anything, the process has been needlessly drawn out: more than 2,300 days have passed since the Keystone application was first filed.","583","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-veto-pipeline-politics-energy-jobs-column/23882407/"
"This level of delay is extreme, even for Washington. In fact, approving these types of pipelines was once routine. In 2009, this administration approved the Alberta Clipper pipeline project — one very similar to Keystone — to bring oil sands petroleum from Canada to the United States. There was little controversy and fanfare. Certainly, no years-long national debate.","584","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-veto-pipeline-politics-energy-jobs-column/23882407/"

"What makes Keystone different? Just politics, really. Since 2009, liberal extremists have used the project as an environmental litmus test for the president. And he has repeatedly aimed to please, moving deadlines until after elections and stalling the project to near-death. The snag in their plan was, Keystone just kept on clearing hurdles, including every environmental test, leaving behind all the excuses for delay. A veto now would be the ultimate sop to these extremists at the expense of the greater good.","586","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-veto-pipeline-politics-energy-jobs-column/23882407/"
"Keystone brings a real benefit to our economy. That's according to the president's own State Department, which says the project will support at least 42,000 American jobs. These are good-paying jobs that go to everyone from construction and energy workers to hotel and restaurant employees in small towns along the pipeline.","587","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-veto-pipeline-politics-energy-jobs-column/23882407/"
"Keystone is also good for the country as a whole, providing a more stable and affordable energy supply to help protect against huge price spikes. Developing North America's energy resources remains one of our best opportunities for long-term growth and competitiveness. When we don't seize on this potential, it's another notch in the belt for competitors like China, which now consumes more energy than we do, produces more coal than we do, and is the world's leading manufacturer.","588","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-veto-pipeline-politics-energy-jobs-column/23882407/"
"So that's who wins with a veto: bureaucrats, extremist environmentalists and the Chinese. Meanwhile, the American worker and the unions that represent them? Canada, our dear ally and top trading partner? The middle-class families the president claims to be committed to helping? They're all left out in the cold.","589","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-veto-pipeline-politics-energy-jobs-column/23882407/"
"This shouldn't be a difficult decision. It shouldn't be about politics, that's for sure. The day after the election, we pledged to return Washington's focus to the people's concerns. We made Keystone a top priority precisely because it is a good starting point for both parties to come work together and make progress on the economy. And we can hope reason will prevail and the president will do the right thing.","590","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-veto-pipeline-politics-energy-jobs-column/23882407/"

"It's hard to make the case that Sen. Harry Reid's decision to retire was a surprise. The 75-year old Nevada Democrat suffered serious eye and facial injuries in a New Year's Day exercise accident, his numbers at home were not great and, for the first time, there has been open disenchantment among his fellow Democrats about his leadership. Shortly after the 2014 midterm elections, in which the Dems lost their majority, Reid was nonetheless re-elected as leader. But there were an unprecedented six of his Democratic colleagues who publicly said they voted against him, and there were hints that the total number was even higher.","597","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/27/harry-reid-resigns-senate-seat-chuck-schumer-column/70552220/"
"That was new to Reid, who has led his party in the Senate since Tom Daschle's defeat in 2004 and who for the most part had a record of success.","598","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/27/harry-reid-resigns-senate-seat-chuck-schumer-column/70552220/"
"Added to all that is the fact that Republicans back home in the Silver State were still kicking themselves over their blown opportunity to defeat Reid in 2010 — their candidate, Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle, was just too controversial. They were determined to make sure they wouldn't fail in 2016. Polls showed Reid on the short end of a potential contest against the state's popular governor, Brian Sandoval. A look at the numbers suggested that 2016 may be a good year for the Democrats. But there was no guarantee that Reid would survive his re-election bid.","599","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/27/harry-reid-resigns-senate-seat-chuck-schumer-column/70552220/"
"Still, to Democrats whose goal is to prepare for battle against the Republicans each day, Reid was their kind of guy: hard-nosed, savvy, partisan, always itching for a fight, befitting his role as a former amateur boxer. He kept many bills passed by the GOP House from ever getting out of the Senate, sparing President Obama the task of having to use his veto pen. He protected his Democratic colleagues by keeping as many controversial votes off the calendar as possible, and infuriated Republicans by often limiting (if not eliminating) opportunities to add amendments to bills. Let's not forget his decision to invoke the ""nuclear option"" and change Senate rules to weaken the minority's ability to filibuster.","600","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/27/harry-reid-resigns-senate-seat-chuck-schumer-column/70552220/"
"But none of that was enough to keep the Democrats' majority in last year's midterms, an election that saw Republicans pick up a whopping nine seats, and Reid got a lot of the blame. He is not (and has never been) the most inspiring communicator on TV. Perhaps that's okay when you're in the majority and you have a Democrat in the White House. But when you're in the minority — and with a presidential race right around the corner — it is just not enough. The Democrats needed more.","601","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/27/harry-reid-resigns-senate-seat-chuck-schumer-column/70552220/"
"Still, even in the minority, his ability to keep his fellow Democrats united was striking. He refused to give ground when the Republicans decided to react to Obama's immigration policies with their ill-advised decision to halt funding of the Department of Homeland Security, and his decision to hold up consideration of the human trafficking bill over abortion language was well received by pro-choice lawmakers and organizations.","602","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/27/harry-reid-resigns-senate-seat-chuck-schumer-column/70552220/"
"But not everyone was impressed. The abortion language was apparently in the bill all along, back when Democrats were praising it and ready to pass it; only when a staffer for Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) belatedly reported it did it become a sticking point. That didn't reflect well on Reid and the leadership. And holding up the human trafficking bill is what, at least according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is holding up confirmation for Loretta Lynch as attorney general. He wants the trafficking bill first, then Lynch. You want Lynch for AG? Pass the human trafficking bill first.","603","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/27/harry-reid-resigns-senate-seat-chuck-schumer-column/70552220/"
"When you're in the minority, you don't always get what you want. Sometimes you have to accept the cards you've been dealt. That's a lesson Democrats have yet to learn. Until they do, they risk becoming as much of the Obstructionist Party as they claimed Republicans have been these past six years.","604","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/27/harry-reid-resigns-senate-seat-chuck-schumer-column/70552220/"
"Harry Reid has spent nearly 30 years in the Senate, and 10 as the Democratic leader, fighting for his party and relishing doing battle with the opposition. Sometimes that style worked. But not always. Come 2017, Democrats are going to learn what life is like with a different leader, with a different style.","605","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/27/harry-reid-resigns-senate-seat-chuck-schumer-column/70552220/"

"Last week, I issued a statement commenting on President Obama's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast. ISIS had just burned alive a Jordanian pilot who was a hostage held in a cage. After condemning ISIS, the President softened his criticism by equating their conduct with Christians during the Crusades.

"The American left speaks with one voice to denigrate and dismiss any opinion they don't agree with. It's a way of diverting attention away from an unacceptable policy position from a man who, whether he likes it or not, is the leader of the free world.

"When the president, in the same breath equates the actions of Christians during the Crusades 800 years ago with the atrocities of ISIS today, he has indeed, as I said, offended every believing Christian in the United States.

"These radical Islamic groups seek to assert their medieval world view upon helpless people under their control. Beheadings are broadcast on video. Stoning to death is considered legitimate punishment against rape victims. Women and children are brutalized, kidnapped and enslaved. When America, as the hope of civilization, intervenes, ISIS and others condemn the U.S. as conducting a new ""Crusade"" against Islam, to win over those of the Muslim faith who do not subscribe to this cult of brutality.

In 2000, in Los Angeles, a longtime friend, Susan Berman, who may have had information about Durst's wife's disappearance, was herself found killed execution style. In 2001, in Texas, Durst was arrested after the triple-plastic wrapped body parts of a neighbor were found floating in Galveston Bay, where Durst was living disguised as a mute woman.

"One art of the investigator is establishing the kind of investigative integrity that persuades witnesses to come forward. One such witness was Berman's stepson.

"In a taped interview, Jarecki first asked a series of largely innocuous questions, a tactic that investigators use to put the suspect off his guard. Then, Jarecki showed Durst the note and letter, both with the misspelling, ""Beverley."" Durst denied having written the anonymous note but was clearly shaken.

"Walmart and McDonald's both recently announced that they will be increasing the wage they pay workers to $10 an hour perhaps in part to stave off criticism from advocates of the so-called ""Fight for $15,"" who are pushing for, you guessed it, $15 an hour. In McDonald's case the $10 wage will apply only to corporate-owned restaurants, meaning it will affect only about 10% of the McDonald's workers, since the rest work at franchises.","675","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/15/mcdonalds-minimum-wage-benefits-society-researhc-column/25814125/"

"Everyone? Basically, yes. Obviously, higher minimum wages help the low-wage workers who get a raise, but in our research, we looked at overall levels of happiness and well-being for whole populations. We looked at survey data made up of rich people, poor people, middle class people, young people, old people, etc. And we found that the higher minimum wage, the higher the average level of happiness overall. In other words, when low-wage workers ask for a raise, the rest of us need not support them out of compassion or sympathy or a sense of justice (although those are sound reasons). We can do so out of self-interest.","677","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/15/mcdonalds-minimum-wage-benefits-society-researhc-column/25814125/"

Posada also faced charges in Venezuela for the 1976 downing of a Cuban passenger airliner that took the lives of 73 people. Posada escaped his Venezuelan prison in 1985 and made his way to the USA.

"Rubio's other reason for opposing Obama's lifting of Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list is equally flawed. He says the Castro regime deserves to remain on the U.S. list of nations that sponsor terrorism because it helped North Korea evade a U.N. arms embargo. In fact, a North Korean cargo ship was stopped in the Panama Canal in 2013 after 240 tons of Cuban military equipment was found in the vessel.","695","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/20/marco-rubio-bloody-shirt-cuba-wickham/26034833/"
"But that was five years after President George W. Bush removed North Korea from the list of nations that sponsor terrorism. And it is political doublespeak for Rubio to say that designation should be maintained when, in 2010, he argued against the U.S. allowing ""the United Nations or any other international body"" to discredit Israel. This came at a time when the U.N. was conducting an investigation of Israel's deadly effort to stop a flotilla of Turkish ships from breaking its embargo of the Gaza Strip.","696","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/20/marco-rubio-bloody-shirt-cuba-wickham/26034833/"

"First, according to the letter and spirit of the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) agreed between Iran and the world powers in November 2013, the comprehensive deal would be based on the Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT), laying out the rights and obligations of parties to the Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As stipulated by the NPT and other relevant international regulations, a treaty party would demonstrate the maximum level of transparency by implementing the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement which is obligatory for all NPT members and the Additional Protocol and Subsidiary Arrangement Code 3.1 — which are voluntary. These three specific arrangements are the maximum measures the world powers can expect within the NPT. And the reassuring element in the process is having a clear understanding that Iran would be ready for such a level of commitment within the final deal. Quite a substantial flexibility on Iran's part and a major contribution towards a final deal.","750","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/06/nuclear-negotiations-iran-america-february-russia-column/22981409/"

"Eight months have passed since a police shooting in Ferguson, Mo. left a young black man dead. Since then, as President Obama wearily noted Tuesday, practically every other week a police-citizen interaction has raised ""troubling questions."" But Obama hinted at a silver lining. ""The good news is, is that perhaps there's some newfound awareness,"" he said, in comments following the violence in Baltimore after the funeral of a man who died in police custody.","5:01 p.m. EDT April 29, 2015","758","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/29/shooting-ferguson-baltimore-america-black-crisis-column/26573293/"
"The latest police-community crisis takes us back to the urban violence of the 1960s. The mega explosion occurred in 1968, after the murder of Martin Luther King. Jr. But even before that, so-called long hot summers had become commonplace. In the first nine months of 1967, violence or disorder broke out in 164 communities across America. The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders sought to explain why cities were burning. Police/citizen conflicts were implicated in almost half of the incidents that the commission closely examined. ""Negroes firmly believe that police brutality and police harassment occur repeatedly in Negro neighborhoods,"" said the commission the month before King was killed — a statement that still stands true today.","759","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/29/shooting-ferguson-baltimore-america-black-crisis-column/26573293/"
"Much has been made of the fact that Baltimore is not Ferguson, that much of its power structure — including its mayor and police commissioner — are black, as if that should make a difference. And perhaps it has. The great distance between the disaffected community and the powers-that-be so evident in Ferguson is not to be seen in Baltimore. The official response has been tempered by understanding and compassion.","760","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/29/shooting-ferguson-baltimore-america-black-crisis-column/26573293/"
"The problem, however, has not much to do with the race, or even the compassion, of the politicians in power. Nor is it simply a function of the ethnic composition of the police department. The problem, lies, at base, with a society loath to give young black men the benefit of the doubt and which sees, in far too many of them, self-fulfilling portents of doom. It lies with a society that has dismantled virtually every obvious manifestation of racism without much alleviating the devastation that centuries of racism spawned.","761","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/29/shooting-ferguson-baltimore-america-black-crisis-column/26573293/"
"America unquestionably has improved since King gave his life fighting for equality. Even so, in this much-improved America, blacks are nearly three times as likely to live in poverty as whites. And though black hope soars and opportunities abound, life remains far from fair. African Americans continue to suffer in the job market, even when they are every bit as qualified as whites. One widely cited study found that black men lacking criminal records were less likely to get callbacks than white men with records. Even having a name that sounds black is enough to reduce the likelihood of getting a job interview or of being taken seriously by an unknown professor. And when it comes to the odds of being imprisoned or shot by police, a black male is the last thing you want to be. Black men are more than six times as likely to be imprisoned as white men, and young black males are 21 times more likely to be shot by cops as their white counterparts.","762","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/29/shooting-ferguson-baltimore-america-black-crisis-column/26573293/"
"Put it together, and you have three interrelated problems, none of which we seem capable of or willing to come to terms with. One is the ongoing depression in many communities of color; the second is our continuing inability to see beyond race, even as we congratulate ourselves for being colorblind; and the third is the oft-witnessed dynamic between young men of color and police officers (rooted in stereotypes and fear) that too often leaves men of color either humiliated or hurt.","763","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/29/shooting-ferguson-baltimore-america-black-crisis-column/26573293/"
"Not even the most accomplished are immune to that dynamic. In a series of surveys conducted for my book, The End of Anger, a majority of black, male Harvard MBAs said they had been discriminated against by police. The experience of police humiliation ranks with being shadowed in stores as an almost universal black male experience.","764","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/29/shooting-ferguson-baltimore-america-black-crisis-column/26573293/"

"Yes, it would require people saying that. In addition, it would require recognizing that the crisis lies not just in the looting and the violence (and we should keep in in mind that in virtually any riot, actual participants are but a fraction of the community) but also in our ongoing denial, and in our inadvertent message to too many young people that violence is the only way to give voice.","766","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/29/shooting-ferguson-baltimore-america-black-crisis-column/26573293/"

"It is easy and politically expedient to perpetuate the idea that being gay and being Christian are somehow mutually exclusive. In doing so, our political discourse excludes an increasing number of Christians who are also gay. I often tell people that my own journey of faith began when I met the man who is now my husband over 11 years ago. I describe the night that Sean and I met as the first time I felt the hand of God moving in my life. Our life together has been an ongoing story of human love and of religious conversion. My same-sex relationship and subsequent marriage are central to my journey from hurt, anger, and atheism to self-acceptance, healing and deep faith.","7:18 a.m. EDT April 28, 2015","838","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/28/faith-law-marriage-equality-column/26448733/"
"Once same-sex marriage was legalized in New York, Sean and I drove to Jamestown so that we could become legitimately married in at least one state. It was an amazing moment for us that was ultimately overshadowed by the reality that once we drove back across the state line, our marriage became a symbol and not a status. In 2014, a court ruling elevated our relationship to legitimacy in our home state. This year, the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. ratified a change to our Book of Order that will allow our denomination to recognize same-sex marriage and we begin the process of planning a blessing of our marriage in the church. As much as we are joyful that our marriage is a reality, we are mindful of the multitudes of people who still do not have access to this basic human right. We are equally mindful of our own feeling that no committed, loving couple should have to face fear and uncertainty when it comes to validating their relationship. For too many, human rights have become a matter of popular vote in ballot boxes. The unconditional love of God as well as the indisputable call for equality found in the U.S. Constitution cannot be silenced by the frailty of human fear and discomfort.","839","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/28/faith-law-marriage-equality-column/26448733/"
"As an American, I see marriage as a right of citizenship. As a person of faith, I see marriage as a serious and powerful symbol of the blessing of human connection. Sean and I both believe very strongly that marriage is the covenant that exists between two committed, monogamous and loving people. Faith teaches us to embrace radical love and to rely on our love for God and one another as the only certain way to heal a broken world. Two people entering into a union of unconditional love is a holy and blessed thing. Seeking to deny those same people the basic civil right to express that love is an invitation to weaken the fabric of democracy and the foundational truths that guide our moral understanding of marriage. As a citizen, I know that we have reached a defining moment in the history of American justice. As a Christian, I cannot deny the reality that God is speaking very clearly as we witness expansions of LGBT equality. Of course, the question of marriage equality before the Supreme Court is a matter of civil marriages and state licenses — the ruling would not impinge on church practices. That is a question that communities of faith will continue to discern for themselves.","840","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/28/faith-law-marriage-equality-column/26448733/"
"For my husband and me, marriage is a serious commitment between two people who will love each other, support each other and remain faithful to each other no matter what. For us, marriage and faith are issues of love and fidelity that play a central role on our lives. Love and marriage taught me to examine and ultimately embrace faith. Ours is a Christian marriage built on love and founded in faith.","841","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/28/faith-law-marriage-equality-column/26448733/"
"These issues are bigger than two guys in Pennsylvania — they affect the entire country.

With 64 percent of our students living in poverty or close to it, getting a college or technical education can seem like a pipe dream. From executives to artists, there is no greater reward for our mentors than building a child's confidence and turning the paralysis of despair into a life filled with hope.","847","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/community-challenge/2015/01/09/mentoring-month-spotlights-jcps-options/21516587/"

She had health issues and was struggling academically while her mother struggled to make ends meet. The Humana executive didn't have much experience with JCPS or students in poverty before this. But she was inspired to help this young girl aspire. The Humana executive came to her graduation with balloons and gifts and was introduced to her mother. The first thing her mom said to the mentor was, ""My daughter really loves you."" It doesn't get much better than that. As luck would have it, this Humana executive entered a contest with other Humana mentors and won $2,000 for Byck Elementary to buy books.","848","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/community-challenge/2015/01/09/mentoring-month-spotlights-jcps-options/21516587/"

According to the notes of one of the regulators, the senator began the meeting saying, ""One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion.""","912","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/02/robert-menendez-corruption-trial-indictment-column/70851384/"

"Committee members came down hardest on Cranston for what they said was a quid pro quo between the campaign money he received and his help for Keating. Cranston was censured. Riegle, who attended only one meeting, was let off with a slap on the wrist, as was Glenn. But both McCain and DeConcini, who were most deeply involved, succeeded in getting off with the mildest punishment, a reprimand for ""poor judgment.""","914","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/02/robert-menendez-corruption-trial-indictment-column/70851384/"

"On Tuesday in a much anticipated speech before joint session of Congress, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again sounded the warning against Iran's nuclear ambitions and called for ""a better deal"" than the nuclear agreement currently being negotiated.","923","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/03/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-iran-column/24309641/"

"He spoke with a candor and toughness that has been lacking from the White House, noting that Iran continues to operate secret nuclear facilities, play ""hide and cheat"" with U.N. inspectors and has ""proven time and again that they cannot be trusted."" He said that we are ""much better without"" the agreement about to be concluded, and should hold out for ""a much better deal."" If Iran walks out, call their bluff; ""they need the deal a lot more than you do.""","926","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/03/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-iran-column/24309641/"

"This was Netanyahu's third speech on Capitol Hill, tying the record set by Winston Churchill for the most Congressional speeches by a foreign leader. House Speaker John Boehner presented the Prime Minister with a bust of Churchill as a welcoming gift. Netanyahu is sometimes compared to the wartime British prime minister, for his ability to deliver a stem-winder speech, his strong leadership and political staying power.","928","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/03/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-iran-column/24309641/"
"Also, like Churchill, Netanyahu has been a voice in the political wilderness, warning of dangerous strategic shifts and growing regional instability. From 1933 onward, Churchill warned of the consequences of Hitler's rising power, Germany's weapons buildup and the overt threats the Nazis made to their neighbors.","929","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/03/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-iran-column/24309641/"
"British establishment politicians dismissed him as a troublemaker. The Obama administration's argument that a tougher line against Iran might lead to war is reminiscent of pro-appeasement British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin's statement in 1936 that the response ""to a stiff letter [to Hitler] might not be a stiff reply but a bomb on your breakfast tables."" Churchill predicted the failure of the 1938 grand bargain with Hitler at Munich that was supposed to bring ""peace in our time,"" saying ""England has been offered a choice between war and shame. She has chosen shame and will get war.""","930","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/03/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-iran-column/24309641/"
"Noting that Churchill was right is not just an exercise in hindsight; it acknowledges his foresight when other British leaders were oblivious. Churchill's genius was taking Hitler's bellicose rhetoric literally.","931","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/03/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-iran-column/24309641/"

"There was a poignant moment during the speech when Netanyahu recognized Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, drawing an explicit link between the consequences of the failure to stop Hitler and the existential threat posed by Iran.","934","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/03/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-iran-column/24309641/"
"Netanyahu's speech is a warning. Some will heed it, others not. The administration argues that its approach to Iran should be given the benefit of the doubt. But when dealing with a rogue state seeking weapons of mass destruction there is more benefit in doubting.","935","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/03/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-iran-column/24309641/"
"If Netanyahu is wrong and Iran's intentions are peaceful, taking a harder line with Tehran will not compel the Islamic Republic to develop nuclear weapons. But if Netanyahu is right about Iran, as Churchill was about Hitler, then President Obama ignores him at his peril, and ours.","936","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/03/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-iran-column/24309641/"

"Until Obama embraced the individual mandate, many conservatives preached that having health insurance was a matter of personal responsibility, because people who don't have coverage and get seriously ill can demand care at emergency rooms and stick others with the unpaid bills.

"Bank robber Willie Sutton is said to have explained his career this way: ""That's where the money is."" Whether Sutton ever really said that, it's an aphorism that, according to Bloomberg's Megan McArdle, explains President Obama's plans to go after middle class assets like 529 college savings plans and home appreciation.","12:33 p.m. EST January 26, 2015","1019","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/25/college-cost-tax-federal-community-obama-money-middle-class-incentives-column/22314063/"
"Though millions of Americans have been putting money into ""tax free"" 529 plans to save for their children's increasingly expensive college educations, President Obama would change the law so that withdrawals from the plans to fund college would be taxed as ordinary income. So while you used to be able to get a nice tax benefit by saving for college, now you'll be shelling out to Uncle Sam every time you withdraw to pay for Junior's dorm fees.","1020","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/25/college-cost-tax-federal-community-obama-money-middle-class-incentives-column/22314063/"
"This doesn't hurt the very rich — who just pay for college out of pocket — or the poor, who get financial aid, but it's pretty rough on the middle– and upper–middle class. In a double-whammy, those withdrawals will show up as income on parents' income tax forms, which are used to calculate financial aid, making them look richer, and hence reducing grants.","1021","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/25/college-cost-tax-federal-community-obama-money-middle-class-incentives-column/22314063/"
"Likewise, Obama proposes to tax the appreciation on inherited homes. When you sell property at a profit, you pay capital gains on the difference between the basis (what you paid) and what you sell it for. (Obama also proposes to increase the capital gains rate). That's not a big issue for most middle class people, because right now if your parents leave you their house, you get what's called a ""step-up"" in basis.","1022","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/25/college-cost-tax-federal-community-obama-money-middle-class-incentives-column/22314063/"
"That means that the basis isn't what your parents paid for the house decades ago, but rather what it was worth when you inherited it. Thus, the appreciation your property experienced while your parents owned it comes to you tax-free. For many families, that appreciation is their biggest inheritance. Now, subject to some exemptions Obama plans to tax those gains, and other gains via inheritance.","1023","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/25/college-cost-tax-federal-community-obama-money-middle-class-incentives-column/22314063/"

"Why would the White House even consider such a thing? As McArdle observes: ""The very fact that we are discussing taxation of educational savings — redistributing educational subsidies downward — indicates that the administration has started scraping the bottom of the barrel when seeking out money to fund new programs. Why target a tax benefit that goes to a lot of your supporters (and donors), that tickles one of the sweetest spots in American politics (subsidizing higher education), and that will hit a lot of people who make less than the $250,000 a year that has become the administration's de facto definition of 'rich'? Presumably, because you're running out of other places to get the money.""","1025","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/25/college-cost-tax-federal-community-obama-money-middle-class-incentives-column/22314063/"
"When a government is desperate for cash, it goes after the middle class, because that's where the money is. Yes, the rich are rich, but the middle class is far more numerous. And this has raised other fears. As McArdle also notes, if 529 plans aren't sacrosanct, what about Roth IRAs? People have worried for a while that the government might go after retirement accounts as another source of income — to the point that there have even been calls for Congress to make such grabs explicitly off limits. But, ultimately, no one is safe, as what is enacted by one Congress can be repealed by another.","1026","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/25/college-cost-tax-federal-community-obama-money-middle-class-incentives-column/22314063/"
"The truth is, in our redistributionist system politicians make their careers mostly by taking money from one group of citizens that won't vote for them and giving it to another that will. If they run short of money from traditional sources, they'll look for new revenue wherever they can find it. And if that's the homes and savings of the middle class, then that's what they'll target.","1027","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/25/college-cost-tax-federal-community-obama-money-middle-class-incentives-column/22314063/"
"For the moment, Americans are safe. With both houses of Congress controlled by the GOP, Obama's proposals are DOA.

"The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that out of $11 trillion in retirement accounts, $1.7 trillion is subject to excessive fees stemming from conflicts of interest.

"Fees can have a substantial impact. Take, for instance, two people investing $100,000 in a fund over 20 years, one paying 0.25% in fees and the other 1.25%. If the fund returned 4% annually, the person paying the higher fee would have about $40,000 less after those 20 years — $170,000 instead of $210,000.","1037","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/09/401k-ira-retirement-savings-investment-brokers-editorials-debates/24672569/"

"Creating a fairer system doesn't have to be hard or involve excess regulation. Under current rules, some investment advisers have a fiduciary duty to act in the ""best interest"" of their clients.

"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Roy Peter Clark has written five books in the past 10 years. But he is a man of few words — and short songs.","5:38 p.m. EDT March 30, 2015","1047","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"
"His brevity, no doubt, derives from his mother, Shirley Hope Clark. The daughter of Italian immigrants and the first member of her family to graduate from high school, she wrote lovingly — but sparingly — about Clark's early life. In the baby book she created shortly after his birth in March 1948, she used mostly one-syllable words to haltingly declare Roy a linguistic prodigy.","1048","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"
"""Age 16 months, Roy is the talk of the neighborhood,"" she wrote. ""He can speak more than any child his age. He can sing every other word of Seesaw, Jack and Jill, Four Leaf Clover, besides a wonderful vocabulary. Mimics everything and everybody.""","1049","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"
"As Clark remembers his mother, who died March 13 at age 95, she, too, was someone who dominated conversations. ""I stand before you for the first time ever in the presence of my mother without the fear of being interrupted,"" he said in a lighthearted opening to his eulogy of her.","1050","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"
"Clark's obsession is more with writing than speaking. For nearly four decades, he has worked to sharpen the writing skills of people in this country — and abroad. As the senior scholar and vice president of the Poynter Institute, this nation's premiere journalism think tank, Clark has won worldwide recognition as a writing teacher for media professionals and curious schoolchildren. This work has earned him the title of ""America's writing coach.""","1051","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"
"But he is not your typical writing instructor. The lessons he offers often come in short bursts of song that he sings while accompanying himself on the piano. Back in 1994 during a national convention of minority journalists, Clark made a presentation on how reporters sent to cover a story could write it in their own voices. It was titled: ""What I learned about writing from listening to the music of Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin.""","1052","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"
"He talked about the similarities between the structure of music and the structure of writing. ""I played different versions of the same song,"" he said, ""to illustrate how performers take the same material and translate it into distinctive voices."" Clark explained to the journalists how Redding's and Franklin's version of the song, Respect, evoked different emotional connections for listeners.","1053","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"
"Since then, Clark says he has used music in every one of his lectures on writing. His goal is not just to hone the skills of journalists, as admirable — and necessary — as that is. It's also to turn this country into a nation of writers. Writing, Clark argues, is ""one of the three behaviors that define literacy in all cultures."" The others are reading and speech. They are the taproots of a smart society.","1054","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"
"Good writing, Clark reminds us in his most recent book, How to Write Short, is not defined by the length of a sentence or the size of the words used. He recently sent his alma mater, Providence College, a report on how it could become a ""college of writers."" It was just two pages long. One of his suggestions: ""Combine 'old school' forms of writing with new forms of expression, such as blogging and social networking."" Another was to ""spread the power and influence"" of writing to distant points beyond the school.","1055","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"
"For all of his efforts, Clark is not well known beyond the journalism profession and pockets of knowledge seekers in this nation's higher education community. This has to change. Clark's understanding of the linkage between writing and literacy — code-switching and acceptable language — and his ability to teach across generations are in short supply.","1056","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/roy-peter-clark-wickham-column/70634120/"

If built, it would provide a reliable source of oil from Canada, and a way to transport other crude from shale formations in North Dakota, at a time when there are still 250 million vehicles on U.S. roads and alternative energy shows little sign of supplanting oil.","1064","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-xl-pipeline-veto-obama-tar-sands-oil-editorials-debates/23952435/"
"If the Keystone pipeline saga were a play, the audience would long ago have gotten up and left out of sheer boredom. The company that wants to build the pipeline first asked for approval from the State Department nearly seven years ago. Since then, every conceivable issue has been exhaustively investigated, and virtually every fact has gotten mangled.","1065","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-xl-pipeline-veto-obama-tar-sands-oil-editorials-debates/23952435/"
"Most of the 42,000 jobs Republicans say Keystone will create will last only as long as it takes to lay the pipe. Once construction is finished, it will support 50 jobs, according to a State Department analysis.","1066","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-xl-pipeline-veto-obama-tar-sands-oil-editorials-debates/23952435/"
"As for critics' claims that the pipeline would be ""game over"" for the climate, the argument would be more compelling if it weren't abundantly apparent that the oil will be produced one way or another, pipeline or no.","1067","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-xl-pipeline-veto-obama-tar-sands-oil-editorials-debates/23952435/"
"The difference is that without Keystone, much of the oil will travel by train, which can be exceptionally dangerous and destructive. The latest example came just last week, when a train carrying oil from North Dakota derailed in West Virginia. At least no one died this time, though a house was destroyed, a river was fouled and drinking water was shut off temporarily. The residents of Lac-Megantic, Quebec, weren't so lucky in July 2013, when an oil train got loose, derailed and exploded inside the small town, killing 47 people.","1068","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-xl-pipeline-veto-obama-tar-sands-oil-editorials-debates/23952435/"
"Obama has sent conflicting signals about whether he'll ultimately approve or reject Keystone. Last November, he gave pipeline critics hope by buying into the argument that the oil Keystone would deliver to U.S. refineries will simply be exported, rather than be used domestically. Politifact.com rated that claim ""mostly false,"" and The Washington Post's Fact Checker gave it three out of four Pinocchios for inaccuracy, noting that the best evidence is that ""at least half"" the oil would remain here.","1069","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-xl-pipeline-veto-obama-tar-sands-oil-editorials-debates/23952435/"
"Congress ought to end this drama by overriding Obama's veto, just the third of his presidency and his first since 2010. If the votes can't be mustered on Capitol Hill, the president has more than enough information to bring down the curtain. It is long past time to just say yes.","1070","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/24/keystone-xl-pipeline-veto-obama-tar-sands-oil-editorials-debates/23952435/"

"Agreements with tyrants and fanatics have very short shelf lives. Case in point, our agreements with North Korea, inked by presidents from both political parties. In 1985, North Korea acceded to the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and in 1991, it signed the South-North Joint Declaration on Denuclearization. In 1993, however, the CIA determined that North Korea had likely already separated enough fissile material for one to two nuclear bombs. Then in 1994, North Korea signed the Agreed Framework to dismantle its nuclear capabilities in exchange for gifts of fuel oil, low-grade reactors and normalized diplomatic relations. In 2002, North Korea admitted to a secret program to enrich uranium, reopened a previously shuttered reactor, and expelled the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors from the country. In 2003, North Korea officially withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Today, North Korea not only boasts nuclear weaponry and long-range missiles, it also exports its technology to some of the world's worst actors.","1109","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/13/obama-courage-peace-deal-iran-column/70237984/"

"The president claims that during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress, he didn't offer a solution. Maybe we read different texts.

Finally, if contrary to reason and expectation those sanctions don't bring Iran to its senses, prepare for a kinetic alternative.","1111","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/13/obama-courage-peace-deal-iran-column/70237984/"
"After all the brickbats heaved by the White House and its friends toward Israel's prime minister, perhaps we should all consider the fact that he and his nation have a particularly good reason to want to get the right answer on Iran: Its leaders have called for the elimination of Israel and Jews.

"That ruling was an overreach. But at least the overreach was limited to closely held companies, which consist of small businesses and some large ones that have small boards of directors and relatively few shareholders, often from a common family. The Indiana law confers religious rights on publicly held corporations as well, expanding the opportunities for unintended consequences, if not outright bigotry.","1125","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/30/indiana-religious-freedom-law-editorials-debates/70697556/"

"Lena Dunham's satirical ""Dog or Jewish Boyfriend?"" quiz in The New Yorker sparked a hailstorm of controversy. She jokingly asks which statements refer to her dog or Jewish boyfriend. Mostly neutral whimsical statements are listed, including, ""(o)ur anniversary is in two days and I'm not sure if he remembers"" or ""(h)e's really more of an ass man."" But other statements like ""(h)e doesn't tip"" or ""he is judgmental about the food"" clearly play on Jewish stereotypes.","4:39 p.m. EDT March 29, 2015","1148","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"
"The Anti-Defamation League and others condemned her for perpetuating anti-Semitic stereotypes. Others, like Salon writer Anna Silmon, said the criticism was an overreaction since Dunham was clearly joking and is far from anti-Semitic.","1149","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"
"But I'd take it a step beyond Dunham's supporters and argue that not only are her comments harmless but they actually benefit the fight to mock, lampoon and dismiss ridiculous and false stereotypes. It relegates bigotry and mean stereotypes to where it belongs: Humor columns in the world of fiction far, far away from the world of reality.","1150","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"
"Stereotypes about Jews being cheap and over-mothered are obviously offensive and false, but there is value in such offensive humor because it helps to disarm and mock real anti-Semitism. The potency of the prejudice is undermined. Bigotry is something we should fictionalize and mock through humor.","1151","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"
"And the fact that Dunham is a Jewish comedian and openly identifies as such puts this into the context of obviously self-deprecating humor. After all, Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy are given a pass to promote stereotypes about country people and rednecks. They don't have a license to promote offensive black stereotypes like black comedians Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock do.","1152","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"
"Sociology professor Cynthia Merriwether-DeVries explains the value of minority comics playing on minority stereotypes: ""I know what the people in power say about my community and I'll say it myself ... it destabilizes their power. It takes away their ability to use that stereotype against me.""","1153","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"
"Also, Dunham's piece was clearly intended to be fictional. The ""Shouts & Murmurs"" section of The New Yorker isn't where you find hard-hitting or thoughtful policy pieces. The submission guidelines explicitly require submissions that ""are humorous fiction,"" not ""first-person essays.""","1154","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"
"Imagine if all racism and bigotry were expressed in satirical papers like The Onion, or satirical news columns like The New Yorker's The Borowitz Report? People would start to recognize expressions of bigotry and racism for what it is: laughable and ridiculous.","1155","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"
"Further, Dunham joking about stereotypes helped spur an open conversations that is necessary to combat and dispel real misconceptions and bigoted stereotypes. These public conversations need to happen. Satire can help bring these otherwise private hush-hush conversations to the public, where it won't be immune from necessary scrutiny and scorn.","1156","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"
"Regardless of Dunham's intentions to mock anti-Semitic stereotypes or give them a kernel of legitimacy, I thank her for sparking a vital conversation, and ultimately relegating pernicious stereotypes to the world of humorous fiction.","1157","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/lena-dunham-dog-jew-column/70630104/"

"Not everything is about race in this country. But when it is about race, then it just is. So when a guy who has been depicted wearing a jacket featuring an apartheid-era Rhodesian flag allegedly walks into a historic black church and guns down nine African-American worshipers at a Bible study meeting, common sense leads one to believe his motivations are based in racism. When a survivor of the ordeal reports that the killer shouted before opening fire, ""You rape our women and you're taking over our country.

"Let's call this sickness what it is, so we can get on with the healing. If this were a medical disease, and all the doctors recognized the symptoms but refused to make the diagnosis for fear of offending the patient, we could call it madness. But there are people who are claiming that they can lead this country who dare not call this tragedy an act of racism, a hate crime, for fear of offending a particular segment of the electorate.","1166","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/22/ben-carson-south-carolina-shooting-column/29074387/"
"I understand the sensitivities. To some, calling the events in Charleston, S.C., a hate crime reinforces a stigma, which they have fought hard to put behind them. But refusing to call it what it is — racism — is a far more dangerous proposition. It reminds me of the early response to Ebola. American health officials were alerted to an epidemic in West Africa, and yet when a patient who had recently left one of the most affected regions showed up at a hospital displaying all the symptoms, the doctors failed to diagnose his condition. This not only led to the eventual death of the patient due to inadequate care but also exposed dozens of others to the deadly virus. When you wait too long to identify the problem, you miss your best chance to stop it.","1167","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/22/ben-carson-south-carolina-shooting-column/29074387/"
"We know what's at stake here, so let's stop all the interpretive dance around the obvious. Was it a depraved act of violence? Of course. Was it an act of unspeakable evil? Affirmative. Was it an attack on innocent Christians? Manifestly so. Is this killer a sick individual? In my professional opinion, yes, he is. What is his sickness? It's the sickness of racism, a spiritual sickness that distorts the mind and heart and causes irrational and baseless fear and hatred in people of all colors. Racism was once epidemic in America, but through struggle, sacrifice, soul-searching and meaningful social change, we have made much progress. Clearly, the struggle is far from finished, and we must own up to that fact and that challenge.","1168","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/22/ben-carson-south-carolina-shooting-column/29074387/"
"Let's not delude ourselves here. The stakes are too high. If we do not do something as a people to directly address the divisions caused by this sickness, we risk losing all of the ground we have made as a country over the past 50 years. And certainly the youth will take cues from their leaders. If we teach them it is OK to deny racism exists, even when it's plainly staring them in the face, then we will perpetuate this sickness into the next generation and the next.","1169","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/22/ben-carson-south-carolina-shooting-column/29074387/"
"When an event of this magnitude occurs in the middle of an election cycle, politicians are often quick to try to score political points, look for scapegoats and easy answers. That's the lowest common denominator of politics at a time when we need true leadership. Now is the time to abandon political expediency and seize this opportunity to demonstrate what we are really made of as a people, as a great country. We have come together in times of crisis, and we have risen to the test time and time again. We are a people whose courageousness has consistently triumphed over fear. We can come out stronger on the other end of this terrible tragedy, and we can heal this sickness that is crippling our nation. I know we can. But first we have to face the facts.","1170","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/22/ben-carson-south-carolina-shooting-column/29074387/"

"The former neurosurgeon, who has rocketed to near the top of the polls since the first Republican debate earlier this month, spoke to a crowd estimated at between 6,000 and 10,000 people at the Phoenix Convention Center as they waved campaign signs reading “Heal,” “Revive” and “Inspire.”","1209","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/08/18/ben-carson-phoenix-visit-rally/31955913/"

"“There are those who say (a lower-income taxpayer) can’t afford to put a buck in,” Carson said. “Why can’t he? Can he afford to send his kids to public school? Can he drive on the public roads? You know, that is so condescending. Pat him on the head and say, ‘There, there, you poor little thing, there’s nothing you can do.’ I grew up in the bottom rungs of society, and I can tell you there are a lot of people there who have pride, and they don’t want to be treated like that.”","1227","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/08/18/ben-carson-phoenix-visit-rally/31955913/"
"At the end of the hour speech, Carson answered questions, telling a young woman that his favorite Bible verse starts, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart.” He told another woman that vaccinations for “lethal and debilitating” diseases should be required but that health providers may “have gotten a little overly exuberant” about recommending others.","1228","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/08/18/ben-carson-phoenix-visit-rally/31955913/"

"The U.S. presidential election is by far the most expensive political race in the world, especially when compared with countries that have strict regulations on campaign funding and expenses. While campaigns are exceedingly costly, individual politicians, too, are often among the wealthiest Americans in the country.","3:20 p.m. EDT August 26, 2015","1273","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/26/24-7-wall-st-net-worth-presidential-candidates/32409491/"
"Presidential candidates can expect very little privacy — in their personal life and with their finances. While candidates are not required to make their tax returns public, the practice has become common since the late 1970s. Based on recently disclosed tax returns and financial disclosures, the candidates’ assets range from Scott Walker, who is worth as little as $36,000, to Donald Trump, who has an estimated net worth of $2.9 billion — by far the highest of any presidential candidate.","1274","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/26/24-7-wall-st-net-worth-presidential-candidates/32409491/"
"Estimating a candidate’s net worth is difficult because reporting exact values is not required. Instead, candidates may disclose their assets and income in a range. Further, candidates do not necessarily report all their assets. For instance, candidates do not need to disclose their personal real estate and property values. Jeb Bush opted to omit assets generated by several holding companies, for example. In addition, while some candidates choose to include their spouses in their disclosures, some do not. Carly Fiorina’s net worth of $59 million, for example, includes that of her husband, Frank. Hillary Clinton’s reported net worth, on the other hand, does not include assets jointly owned by her and former president Bill Clinton, who is worth by some estimates more than $50 million.","1275","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/26/24-7-wall-st-net-worth-presidential-candidates/32409491/"
"In addition, the net worth of a presidential candidate does not necessarily determine the financial strength of the associated campaign. Campaign expenditure in the United States has increased even more since 2010, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that political spending is a form of free speech. This opened the door for corporations and unions to sway the voting public via indirect, but unlimited, contributions.","1276","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/26/24-7-wall-st-net-worth-presidential-candidates/32409491/"
"Some candidates’ campaign funds are far greater than their net worth, while others are far lower. Bernie Sanders is one of the poorest presidential candidates, yet his campaign has raised over $16.4 million so far. Jeb Bush, on the other hand, has raised nearly $12 million, but his maximum estimated net worth is valued at nearly twice that.","1277","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/26/24-7-wall-st-net-worth-presidential-candidates/32409491/"
"Still, the wealth of a presidential candidate seems to matter a great deal. Fundraising is crucial for candidates, and the candidates who are able to focus more on earning votes and less on raising money have an advantage. Obama and Mitt Romney’s campaigns each raised just over $1 billion in 2012. Even by the lowest estimates, Donald Trump does not need to raise a single dime from here through Election Day to have more funds available than both 2012 candidates combined. To date, Trump has self-financed roughly 95% of his campaign’s spending. Just 6% of Bernie Sanders’ campaign spending has come out of the senator’s pocket.","1278","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/26/24-7-wall-st-net-worth-presidential-candidates/32409491/"
"To identify the net worth of each presidential candidate, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the most recent tax filings of the 10 highest-polling Republican presidential candidates, as well as the two highest-polling Democratic presidential candidates. Each candidate’s poll is an average of four widely recognized surveys of American opinion, including CNN and Fox. In order to determine ranges for each of these candidates we relied on the best available data from at least one of the following sources: analyses from third-party sources of personal financial disclosures provided to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), statements made by the candidates’ campaigns, and in the case of current members of Congress, specific net worth values obtained by the Center for Responsive Politics through 2013 tax filings. The center also provided campaign finance figures.

Today, Bush’s campaign aides estimate his net worth to be between $19 million and $22 million. Earlier this year, The Boston Globe reported that the former governor is having a vacation home built on a $1.4 million piece of property in Kennebunkport, Maine.

Obama did not ""blame Christians"" for either atrocity.

Huckabee's comment also ignored the well-documented threats posed by climate change.","1374","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/05/fact-check-huckabee-fiorina-carson/26916997/"

"His penchant for unleashing blunt, controversial (some might say thoughtless, others racist) one-liners without regard for consequence seems to be part of the candidate's appeal. But, according to late-night comic Larry Wilmore, Trump has set a dangerous precedent. Now other candidates have upped the cray cray factor just to get equal attention.

"In a democracy, voting is the most cherished right. And yet, in America — the world’s most exemplary democracy — there is no explicit constitutional guarantee of the right to vote. Instead, the right to vote is selectively addressed in constitutional provisions and in federal legislation. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most important legislative initiatives in American history, is one of them. The VRA was signed into law 50 years ago Thursday.","8:24 a.m. EDT August 6, 2015","1422","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"
"In near-absolute terms, the First Amendment bans any law “prohibiting the free exercise [of religion],” “abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” The Second Amendment boldly states that “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”","1423","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"
"If the Founders had been as affirmatively declaratory about voting as they were about talking, worshiping, publishing, assembling, petitioning and arming, perhaps they would also have addressed voting in a single inclusive amendment, instead of four issue-specific ones: XV (race discrimination), XIX (gender discrimination), XXIV (poll taxes), and XXVI (voting age).","1424","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"
"But they may have been purposefully cautious. As President Johnson said in 1965, “the most basic right of all [is] the right to choose your own leaders.” Voting determines who will set the policies, who will make the rules, who is important, and who is not. Voting determines who is in charge.","1425","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"
"Granting rights associated with voting in piecemeal, rather than comprehensive, terms has protected the “original power” that the Founders reserved for themselves and their generational progeny. It has also left the door open to condition and limit voting in ways designed to benefit the power brokers. The vicissitudes of time and social pressure have compelled extensions of voting rights to black men, women, the poor, and citizens 18 and older, but the escape hatch has harvested machinations designed to compromise those rights.","1426","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"
"Yes, the Voting Rights Act brought dramatic changes to America’s political landscape, but it was, nevertheless, another piecemeal effort to shield the right to vote from racial prejudice. For that reason, it engendered a backlash against black voter success, including serial lawsuits, until revisionists were finally successful in persuading the Supreme Court to eviscerate the VRA in 2013 in Shelby County v. Holder.","1427","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"
"As if the decision outlawing enhanced Justice Department oversight for certain states (including Alabama) were a royal invitation to dilute voting rights for blacks, several of those very states wasted no time in enacting legislation that bans early voting, eliminates election-day and Sunday voter registration, and imposes strict voter ID rules. According to Mike Turzai, the Pennsylvania House majority leader, voter ID was designed to “allow [the Republican candidate] to win the state of Pennsylvania” against the African American president in 2012.","1428","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"
"At no time in our history would Americans have countenanced similar restrictions on the rights protected in the First or Second Amendments. Imagine restricting the free exercise of speech or religion to certain places on certain days, limiting press coverage to public figures, or limiting gun possession and use to hunting only.","1429","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"
"At a time when Americans can go online to choose a doctor, get a college education, secure or alter Social Security/Medicare/Obamacare benefits, pay taxes, receive tax refunds, shop and manage major financial accounts, we cannot use the same tool to exercise our most fundamental right.","1430","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"

"Without a general proscription on the denial of the right to vote, we are doomed to a future of piecemeal enforcement. A blanket prohibition like the First or Second Amendment, permitting rare abridgment, might solve the problem. Maybe we need an amendment that says: “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.”","1432","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/americans-voting-rights-separate-but-equal/31189659/"

"So Friday's New York Times contained an enormous scoop — one so important that it was bylined by two reporters, Alan Rappeport and Steve Eder, and a researcher, Kitty Bennett. The scoop? That Marco Rubio had some traffic tickets. Well, actually, only four in 18 years. But the story combined Rubio's driving record with that of his wife so that it could maintain that the couple ""had a combined 17 citations.""","11:23 a.m. EDT June 8, 2015","1492","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"
"In other words, Rubio had four, and his wife had 13. Worse yet, we're told, the Rubios had to attend driving school on four occasions.","1493","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"
"I have some firsthand experience with this phenomenon. A few years back I was leaving the Palm Beach International Airport on a divided multilane road with interstate signage, going about 50. I got pulled over in a radar trap, where I was informed that the speed limit was 35, though I hadn't seen any signs. Like one or the other of the Rubios, I got the ticket dismissed in exchange for sitting through a Florida traffic school (mine was online).","1494","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"
"Also like the Rubios, I was solicited from lawyers who said things such as, ""Have you received a traffic ticket? Don't pay it."" But because I'm a lawyer myself, I didn't hire them; I just paid the court costs and traffic school fees. Does the Times think I'm a scofflaw?","1495","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"
"Rappeport, Eder and Bennett's earth-shattering traffic scoop produced rather a lot of mockery from people on the right, and from some on the left. Longtime political correspondent Jeff Greenfield tweeted: ""Rubio TrafficTicketGate? This a parody of political journalism gone nuts, right?""","1496","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"
"Yeah, pretty much. To add to the embarrassment, the Times, though it has since silently corrected the piece, referred to Marco Rubio's Ford F-150 pickup as a ""sports utility vehicle,"" displaying the level of automotive literacy expected of Manhattan residents.","1497","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"

"Even most of the major newspapers and networks declined to treat the Times' story seriously. Fox News emphasized the hit-piece style of the story, and The Wall Street Journal mocked it; CNN was mum; and The Washington Post's Erik Wemple warned the Times it is setting itself up for criticism if it doesn't hold other presidential candidates to the same level of scrutiny. Of the major networks, only MSNBC gave the story the time of day.","1499","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"
"Well, that's fine. The Times did some digging, and the best it could come up with was evidence that, unlike many politicos, Rubio didn't pull strings to make his tickets vanish.","1500","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"
"Er, except that maybe the Times didn't do the digging. The Washington Free Beacon's Brent Scher reported that the Times likely got the records from a Democratic opposition research firm, American Bridge. ""Records show that each of the citations mentioned by the New York Times were pulled in person by American Bridge operatives on May 26, 2015. ... Neither of the reporters, Alan Rappeport and Steve Eder, appeared on the docket records for any of the traffic citations for Rubio and his wife. An additional researcher credited in the New York Times, Kitty Bennett, also does not appear on any of the court records.""","1501","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"
"When Scher asked the Times for comment, he got no reply. Instead, the Times went to Politico's Dylan Byers to give its side of the story. Byers published its denial that American Bridge was behind the story. (Scher is skeptical.) I'm not sure what's worse: The possibility that the Times just reprinted opposition research from a partisan source (while crediting two reporters and a researcher), or the Times thinking on its own that this was a big scoop.","1502","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"
"Oh, well. I'm inclined to agree with Jeff Greenfield that this is a parody of a political gotcha story. But if you think that the Rubios are a menace on the road, perhaps you should vote for the senator for president, so that he and his wife will have drivers. Look at Hillary Clinton: Her husband got elected to the White House, and she hasn't driven a car herself since 1996.","1503","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/07/rubio-crime-spree-new-york-times-column/28643927/"

"The Republican reluctance to criticize Trump is mystifying considering that the blog FiveThirtyEight.com has rated him ""the most hated candidate"" in decades. Based on recent polls, they found that 57% of Republican voters have an unfavorable view of the developer and reality TV star. It would not cost much, politically, for mainstream Republicans to rebuke Trump, or at least challenge his outrageous statements. Trump said that immigration leads to more crime, for instance, while research from the American Immigration Council suggests otherwise.","1557","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/24/donald-trump-speech-mexico-derogatory-comments-column/29113581/"

"There was one candidate who had the courage to speak up about Trump: Hillary Clinton. She said his words were ""emblematic"" of the kind of rhetoric that cannot be tolerated in light of events like the South Carolina church shootings. She's right.

"Sure, immigration is still a contentious issue among some conservatives; former RNC Chairman Michael Steele said last week on MSNBC that Trump's comments resonate with voters. ""There are a lot of folks who look at the Mexican border the way he pronounced it yesterday,"" Steele said. That is no excuse for hate speech. A candidate can be against immigration or immigration reform and not devolve into racism. Imagine the furor that would have likely erupted if Trump had similarly disparaged African Americans or Jews. Meanwhile, it is still acceptable for a presidential candidate to denigrate Latinos.","1560","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/24/donald-trump-speech-mexico-derogatory-comments-column/29113581/"

"Government needs to do its job. When it does, I am confident that the American people can and will meet these new security challenges with clear debate and constant resolve.

"It may seem unlikely today, but when all is said and done with Deflategate and Tom Brady returns to the field, the Patriots, the NFL and even Brady all stand to emerge as winners in business over the long-term.","6:30 p.m. EDT July 29, 2015","1652","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/29/tom-brady-deflategate-controversy-effects-column/30838857/"
"To be sure, the Deflategate crisis has been fraught with controversial questions. Was the “more probable than not” evidence cited in the Wells Report strong enough to convict Tom Brady? If so, what is a reasonable punishment? How serious of an offense is deflating footballs? How should Brady’s cooperation (or alleged lack thereof) in the investigation, including the recent revelation of his destroyed cell phone, factor into the punishment and appeal process? Fans and the media have been deliberating these and other issues with the same fervor as ranking the greatest quarterbacks of all-time (which, naturally, has been complicated by the allegations against Brady).","1653","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/29/tom-brady-deflategate-controversy-effects-column/30838857/"
"But when you examine this controversy from a business standpoint, the long-term brand and revenue implications (based on what we know now) could be minimal. Imagine the scene at Lucas Oil Stadium on Sunday, October 18, 2015. The New England Patriots will visit the Indianapolis Colts for the game of the week on Sunday Night Football. If Brady serves his four-game suspension, he will be back under center that night for the first time in the 2015 regular season, playing against the same team that first reported the charges that are dominating this year’s NFL offseason.","1654","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/29/tom-brady-deflategate-controversy-effects-column/30838857/"
"This made-for-television storyline will likely generate pregame hype nearing Super Bowl proportions and come close to (if not surpass) a record regular season rating. It’s tough to accurately predict who will win the game, but the safest best is that October 18th will be yet another banner night for the National Football League.","1655","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/29/tom-brady-deflategate-controversy-effects-column/30838857/"
"Indeed, all key parties in the Deflategate controversy (the Patriots, NFL, and Brady) have an opportunity to move on from this situation and strengthen their position over the long-term. Here’s why:","1656","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/29/tom-brady-deflategate-controversy-effects-column/30838857/"
"The Patriots have built and maintained a loyal fan base that is standing by the team through good times and bad. From a business perspective, it matters little that they are the most disliked team in America right now. As long as the team’s target audience — Patriots fans — remains fully in support of the team, the brand will stay healthy. And if the #FreeBrady movement online and offline is any indication, fan loyalty to the defending Super Bowl champions has never been stronger. If anything, Deflategate has emboldened Patriots Nation, creating an us-against-the-world mentality, and, by extension, strengthened the Patriots brand overall.","1657","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/29/tom-brady-deflategate-controversy-effects-column/30838857/"
"For its part, the NFL likely ends up in an improved position post-Deflategate (perhaps everywhere but in New England). After a 2014 season full of crises, the league is on a mission to restore its credibility. Against this backdrop, coming down harsh on the Patriots and Brady to protect the integrity of the game was the least objectionable alternative. A softer stance on both the suspension and appeal would have called into question Commissioner Roger Goodell’s authority. Meanwhile, the league is not likely to see any revenue losses from this crisis; media rights revenue is fixed, and national sponsorships are intact. Business should continue to be good for the most successful sports league in the U.S.","1658","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/29/tom-brady-deflategate-controversy-effects-column/30838857/"
"Finally, although he is in the most precarious position of all, Tom Brady still can emerge successfully from this controversy. In spite of the allegations, Brady’s fans are rallying behind their hero and the injustices they believe he is facing. This summer, for the first time in his legendary career, he led the NFL in merchandise sales, a trend undoubtedly driven by Deflategate. On Wednesday morning, his Facebook post addressing the cell phone destruction attracted more than 200,000 likes in three hours. At the same time, the chorus of Brady haters has also intensified, and there is no question his golden boy image has taken a hit nationally. But fan perceptions can shift quickly in the sports world, and with time and a thoughtful communication strategy, Brady may still end his career considered by football fans everywhere as one of the greatest quarterbacks and ambassadors of all time.","1659","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/29/tom-brady-deflategate-controversy-effects-column/30838857/"
"The Deflategate controversy has already seen many twists and turns. Of course, new disclosures or other developments could make this situation even more challenging for all parties involved. Certainly, if Brady is ever unequivocally convicted of wrongdoing, the long-term business equation for his or the Patriots’ brand may change. What’s more likely is that on the night of October 18, the nation will be watching the action at Lucas Oil Stadium, and it will be big business as usual for the NFL, a marquee franchise, and one of its brightest stars.","1660","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/29/tom-brady-deflategate-controversy-effects-column/30838857/"

This refusal is a strategic mistake, and the fact that we’re making it may indicate things are even worse than we’ve been led to believe.","8:16 a.m. EDT July 28, 2015","1697","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"By declining to tell the truth about China, we abandon a core tenet of cyber deterrence theory: public attribution. The administration knows this.","1698","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"In April, the Department of Defense issued its new Cyber Strategy that explicitly states: “Attribution is a fundamental part of an effective cyber deterrence strategy as anonymity enables malicious cyber activity by state and non-state groups … Public and private attribution can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place.”","1699","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"So why is the administration officially staying silent? Inside Washington, two rationales have been floated. But to the 21 million Americans who had their information stolen — many of whom work in our defense and intelligence communities — one of these rationales isn’t compelling and the other is downright disturbing.","1700","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"The administration’s first — and flimsiest — justification for staying silent is that attributing the attacks to China could force us to reveal our own intelligence sources and methods. This is wrong. Telling the truth about China doesn’t disclose our own capabilities. We’re not taking China to court. We don’t have to publicly file the intelligence and analysis that informs our judgments.","1701","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"Instead, we could do what we did with the North Korean hack of Sony Entertainment Pictures — we simply said we had our reasons for concluding Pyongyang was the culprit and that it wasn’t ambiguous. Some in the cyber community objected that they didn’t have all of the information; but, in the end, we identified the North Koreans and our sensitive information was not released.","1702","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"The administration’s second, more concerning, justification for not publicly blaming the Chinese is that doing so could force the United States into taking some type of retributive action, sparking a rapid escalation between Washington and Beijing and possibly starting an online shooting war. If the OPM and other hacks have taught us anything, it’s that the United States would be exceedingly vulnerable in such a conflict. Our own national security leaders have made this clear.","1703","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"Since 2013, the Director of National Intelligence has identified the cyber threat as the number one strategic risk for the United States, more threatening than terrorist attacks or traditional wars. Cyber threats keep our defense and intelligence leaders up at night because no aspect of daily life is immune to attack, and the administration’s decision not to attribute the OPM hack to the Chinese suggests that we’re not operating from a position of strength.","1704","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"Americans know security matters are sometimes handled in discreet ways out of the public view. Maybe the same bureaucrats who couldn’t identify the hack for more than a year are now planning an intricate and clandestine cyber response that will teach the Chinese a lesson and preclude a cyber standoff. Maybe, but there is reason to be skeptical.","1705","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"Instead, many are concerned that Washington has neglected cyber security for so long that we now find ourselves in a dangerous position. We know what we need to do — aggressively deter cyber attacks — but we are unable to do so because we are too vulnerable to those very threats.","1706","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"Something big has to change.","1707","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"We need to do a serious scrub of our cyber threat assessments, of our defensive posture against online attacks, and of our offensive cyber doctrine. We can’t be passive anymore. We can’t sit in silence and naively hope that we’ll somehow still manage to preserve our national interests or our way of life.","1708","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"
"Perhaps the administration has a different reason for not publicly blaming China for the OPM attack. If they did, it is in direct contradiction to their own cyber strategy. If they are silent out of duress, however, it underscores the essential point that we’ve got a lot more to worry about than just the loss of social security numbers and ruined credit scores. Our national security is at stake.","1709","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/27/white-house-china-opm-hacks-column/30724555/"

"Walker, 47, is taken seriously for reasons historic and geographic. The historic: In 2012, he became the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall election. Liberals and labor groups launched the recall in outrage over his efforts to curb the clout of public-employee unions. His landmark victory then and re-election two years later has made him a hero to conservative activists and given him a national fundraising base.","1728","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/13/first-take-scott-walker-donald-trump/30030925/"

"Then there's the geographic.

"If you see an indescribably bright flash of light, drop immediately to the ground and get under whatever cover you can find. Once the blast has passed, find somewhere to shelter from the fallout for a few days. The more stuff between you and the outside, the safer you’ll be. Remember the Rule Of Seven: Seven hours after the nuclear explosion, the radiation will be 1/10 of its peak; seven times seven (49 hours, or two days) it will be 1/100, and seven times that (basically, two weeks) it will be 1/1000.","5:15 p.m. EDT August 19, 2015","1737","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/19/nuclear-attack-fallout-response-column/31814403/"
"This is the essence of the sound-but-mocked “Duck and Cover” advice from Bert The Turtle over half a century ago.

"As the Cold War progressed, and the United States and the Soviet Union moved from having arsenals of a few nuclear (“atomic"") weapons — with explosive power measured in “kilotons,” or thousands of tons of TNT equivalents — to massive stockpiles of thermonuclear (“hydrogen”) weapons with yields in the megatons, or millions of tons of TNT equivalent, many people doubted the wisdom of this advice. When a nuclear war looked less like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and more like the closing scene to Dr. Strangelove, many feared that the duck-and-cover approach would be a waste of time. But duck-and-cover was a good response to atomic attack. It was based on atomic tests and interviews with Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors, and was intended to drastically reduce the casualties from similar attacks here at home. It would have worked.","1739","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/19/nuclear-attack-fallout-response-column/31814403/"
"When the Cold War ended, people forgot about that stuff, to the point that when I teach Cold War material in my Constitutional Law or National Security Law courses, I find that my law students, except for a few military veterans or emergency-services types, know nothing about basic nuclear weapons facts that almost everyone knew as late as the 1980s.

"Israel and India have the bomb, but they’re not threats. Russia and China have the bomb, and they’re not entirely friendly. Pakistan has the bomb, and it’s not so friendly.

It’s just possible that they might mean it.","1741","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/19/nuclear-attack-fallout-response-column/31814403/"
"At any rate, the threat of atomic attack today looks greater than it has in decades, and the attacks we fear look more like 1950 than 1965.

"Such an attack would still be a calamity of the first order. Dozens of city blocks would be obliterated, a much larger area would be severely damaged, and casualties from blast, fire and nuclear flash burns would number in the thousands at least. Preparations of the duck-and-cover variety would cut that number significantly.","1743","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/19/nuclear-attack-fallout-response-column/31814403/"
"The federal government is already publishing advice on sheltering from fallout and surviving a nuclear blast. As W.

"Well, as Iran moves closer to getting its own nuclear devices, and with the likelihood that other Middle Eastern countries will follow suit, the world may not be moving any closer to a Dr. Strangelove style global cataclysm, but the likelihood that we’ll see a nuclear weapon set off in anger somewhere seems to be growing. So far, though, our attention seems to have wandered.

"Some harrowing details emerged in Monday's court appearance for the suspect held in the case of a slain Texas sheriff's deputy. Shannon Miles, accused in the fatal shooting of Deputy Darren Goforth, was arraigned on a capital murder charge that could bring the death penalty. Prosecutors described how surveillance cameras at the gas station showed a black male drive up in a red pickup, walk behind Goforth and shoot him several times in the back of the head. In all, 15 shell casings were found near the body. What we don't know: why. Miles has a history of relatively minor run-ins with police but no apparent connection to Goforth, 47, a 10-year veteran of the department. What we do know: Goforth was married with two children. His wife, Kathleen, says, ""My husband was an incredibly intricate blend of toughness and gentility. He was loyal ... fiercely so.

But the beef lives on! This time, directed at Miley Cyrus, whom Minaj called — on live TV — the b-word. (Cyrus slammed Minaj last week in an interview with TheNew York Times.) Twitter, of course, went nuts. Speaking of Miley Cyrus: She had a wardrobe malfunction, but that wasn't her biggest moment of the night.

"For the past 10 years, I’ve had a chip on my shoulder, or to be more precise, a brick. It’s all I have left of my childhood home on the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina’s relentless winds and raging storm surge devoured our entire community. When I mention that, most people invariably respond, “It was awful what the hurricane did to New Orleans.”","7:32 p.m. EDT August 24, 2015","1844","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"
"And therein lies the problem. I didn’t grow up in New Orleans. My family didn’t even live in Louisiana. The home we had owned for more than 30 years was one of the 65,000 destroyed in Mississippi, leaving more than 100,000 people homeless.","1845","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"
"Few realize that the massive hurricane veered east at the last minute and roared onshore at the Louisiana-Mississippi state line, making the Magnolia State ground zero. The sustained 125-mph winds, 30-foot storm surge and hopscotching tornadoes reduced virtually every structure within a half-mile of the water to kindling. Because Katrina was so vast, the destruction stretched the entire length of the more than 75-mile-long Mississippi Gulf Coast all the way into Alabama.","1846","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"
"I was CNN’s correspondent in Mobile, where parts of downtown were submerged under 4 feet of water at the height of the storm on Aug. 29, 2005. I tracked a wrap report that afternoon that included the line, “New Orleans dodged a bullet.” Before it could air, the network learned the levees had collapsed and the city was filling with water. The news media spotlight quickly swung west, and Mississippi slipped into the shadows.","1847","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"
"The citizens of my once-picturesque hometown of Bay St. Louis and the other battered cities along the Mississippi shoreline climbed out of the rubble and got to work. Survivors shared what little they had left with those around them. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers poured south to help put the region back together house by house. Billions of dollars in federal aid over the past decade has funded the reconstruction of roads, bridges, schools, public buildings and vital infrastructure.","1848","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"
"As Katrina’s 10th anniversary is marked Saturday, the Mississippi Gulf Coast fully expects its recovery story will again be overshadowed by New Orleans’. Why does that matter? Because, as the saying goes, journalism is the first draft of history. Every news report that refers only to “the hurricane that hit New Orleans” cements the misconception still held by most Americans that only the Crescent City was impacted.","1849","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"
"Correcting that error has been an exercise in frustration for Mississippians ever since the hurricane hit. In my 2010 book, Rising from Katrina: How My Mississippi Hometown Lost It All and Found What Mattered, I relate the story of a 7-year-old evacuee from Mississippi whose teacher in Orlando, Fla., scolded him months after the storm when he challenged her assertion that New Orleans alone caught the brunt of the hurricane. The bespectacled Peter Drackett solemnly described how his home, his uncle’s home and his friends’ and neighbors’ houses in Bay St. Louis had all been destroyed. “Well, that’s not what they showed on TV!” his second-grade teacher declared in a huff.","1850","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"
"Validation is an important part of the healing process after any disaster. Losing everything is difficult enough. But struggling in silence while no one understands the magnitude of the destruction can make the suffering even harder to bear. Mississippians don’t want anyone’s pity. But they would appreciate acknowledgment — a pat on the back for the resurrection that the plucky region has managed to engineer.","1851","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"

"“What hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast was a natural disaster — a hurricane pure and simple,” explained actor John Goodman’s character to a British journalist. “The flooding of New Orleans was a man-made catastrophe, a federal f---up of epic proportions and decades in the making!” The impassioned speech still elicits cheers from Mississippians and Louisianans.","1853","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"
"I and those who loved the cities where we grew up just as they were will always mourn who and what was lost. The Bay St. Louis I knew now only exists in our collective memories. We have learned to embrace the “new normal” that has emerged. Resilient communities let go and adapt.","1854","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/24/hurricane-katrina-mississippi-ignored-column/32275037/"
"So on Katrina +10, the Mississippi Gulf Coast is inviting the news media and the public to come south and commemorate this milestone with its residents.

"Some hope President Obama might even stop by; he has attended Katrina ceremonies only in New Orleans. Like the Mississippi Gulf Coast, it has come so far since Aug. 29, 2005.

"The expanded Suez Canal opens Thursday, which could give Egyptians a much-needed economic boost after years of political unrest. Mass protests forced President Hosni Mubarak out of office in 2011, and the 2012 election of Mohamed Morsi, an Islamic activist, was cut short when the military staged a coup in 2013. The vital passageway — spearheaded by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi — connects the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea, and its widening will increase traffic from 50 ships a day to 97. Annual profits from the canal should more than double from $5.3 billion to $13.2 billion by 2023.","1864","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/06/5-things-you-need-know-thursday/30995697/"

"At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1945, a U.S. military plane dropped the first ever atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will speak at the memorial for the 70th anniversary of the blast Thursday. The first 1945 bomb killed an estimated 140,000 people, destroyed more than 90% of the city and was the beginning of the end of World War II. About 183,000 Japanese classified as ""hibakusha,"" or atomic bomb survivors are still alive, and Japanese officials are rushing to collect the personal stories of the aging survivors.

"What do you call it when a prosecutor forces a magazine to hand over confidential information — and then orders the magazine not to publish anything about it? Some might call it heavy-handed judicial overreach, but lately it's just another day at the office for those who purport to administer justice.","8:27 a.m. EDT June 22, 2015","1876","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/21/reason-magazine-free-speech-suppression-column/29070279/"
"The magazine is Reason, a well-known libertarian publication that has been around for decades. The confidential information was IP and server information that would allow federal authorities to identify certain blog commenters to a story about the verdict and sentence in the Silk Road case. Though I and other legal experts who've looked at the situation don't think those comments could plausibly be considered ""true threats"" (and thus outside the protection of the First Amendment), Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Niketh Velamoor served Reason with a subpoena ordering it to turn over the IP addresses and other identifying information for those commenters.","1877","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/21/reason-magazine-free-speech-suppression-column/29070279/"
"Was that legal? Probably. Although — particularly in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Elonis v. United States, which came out days before Bharara's office acted — Internet hyperbole can't be punished unless it's both intended and reasonably understood as an actual threat, federal law enforcement has extensive investigative powers. So although the First Amendment gives you the right to say nasty things — and, even, to say them anonymously — it doesn't stop federal investigators from issuing a subpoena in an effort to discover your identity.","1878","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/21/reason-magazine-free-speech-suppression-column/29070279/"
"And if you're a magazine, such as Reason, that prides yourself on open comments, it doesn't stop the government from forcing you to turn over that identifying information. And, apparently, it doesn't stop the fed from ordering you not to tell people that you've been forced to turn over that information.","1879","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/21/reason-magazine-free-speech-suppression-column/29070279/"
"The frothings of Internet commenters, of course, are apt to be regarded as low-value speech. Even so, in a world where, increasingly, people are hounded out of their jobs or subjected to legal harassment for things that they say, the ability to speak anonymously is of growing importance.","1880","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/21/reason-magazine-free-speech-suppression-column/29070279/"
"As Reason editors Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch write: ""Reason's experience needs to be understood in a larger context. Especially since the 9/11 attacks, there has been a mounting conflict between the values of free speech and constitutional due process, with government making increasing demands — often under threat of punishment — for all sorts of information from innocent citizens. Coupled with the rise of a secretive and pervasive surveillance state, this tension means that Americans have no way of knowing just how unfree their speech really is.""","1881","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/21/reason-magazine-free-speech-suppression-column/29070279/"
"When the government orders people not to talk about what it's doing, it's hard to keep track of what it's doing. That's what the First Amendment is intended to prevent. It's ironic that the Obama administration — whose supporters in 2008 made much of threats to civil liberties from George W. Bush's national security apparatus — has so thoroughly embraced surveillance and gag orders.","1882","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/21/reason-magazine-free-speech-suppression-column/29070279/"
"But if it won't support a prosecution, why gather this information? Bharara's office isn't talking, but I suspect that the purpose of this exercise is to chill speech: To send a signal that whether or not the First Amendment protects your right to talk smack about a federal judge, you'd be wise not to do so if you don't want to attract the attention of the feds, who might choose to share your information with employers or the news media. Consider it a sort of prosecutorial brush-back pitch, if you like.","1883","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/21/reason-magazine-free-speech-suppression-column/29070279/"
"Of course, the First Amendment term for ""brush-back pitch"" is ""chilling effect."" The goal, presumably, is to discourage speech protected under the First Amendment, but disliked by authorities. That's an odd thing from a prosecutor who is sworn to uphold the Constitution — but, these days, perhaps not as odd as all that. Add this case to the mounting pile of evidence that out-of-control prosecutors need to be reined in. Starting, perhaps, with the Southern District of New York.","1884","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/21/reason-magazine-free-speech-suppression-column/29070279/"

"When South Carolina Sen.

Other top locales for Facebook chatter about Graham on Monday were North Carolina, D.C., New Hampshire and, for some reason, Maine.","1 p.m. EDT June 4, 2015","1887","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"
"As the aspirants for the 2016 presidential nominations announce their candidacies, they have left a unique digital footprint on the nation's Facebook conversation, according to data assembled by the giant social media platform.","1888","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"
"For example,when former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, a Republican, announced he was seeking the party's nomination, his statements had the biggest impact in Facebook conversations in his home state, as well as the nearby states of Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee.","1889","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"

"This data are provided by Facebook as a part of the social media platform's analysis of the conversation in the 24 hours surrounding each candidate's presidential announcement. The results reflect the top five states for engagement per capita for each candidate on the day they announced. Republican Carly Fiorina's total engagement — likes, shares, comments — was higher in Arkansas than in Texas, but this is not a comparison of her results in Arkansas to Huckabee or Clinton, both of whom are likely to have higher Arkansas profiles.","1891","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"
"Part of the challenge of comparing Facebook data is that candidates like Clinton and presumably Jeb Bush, the Republican former governor of Florida, begin the season with a much larger national footprint than, say, Republican surgeon and activist Ben Carson or Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.. They are bigger, better known ""brands."" When Clinton launched her campaign April 12, Facebook reported that 4.7 million people on Facebook ""generated 10.1 million interactions (likes, posts, comments, shares) related to Hillary Clinton and her announcement.""","1892","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"
"By comparison, Rand Paul generated 1.9 million engagements from 865,000 people on the day of his announcement. Former New York governor George Pataki generated 81,000 engagements from 59,000 people the day he declared a long-shot White House bid.","1893","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"
"So instead of a straight numeric comparison, the Day One maps attempt to gauge where each candidate made the biggest relative impact on their coming out day. The information is interesting, but of limited use — it perhaps demonstrates where a candidate begins the campaign season with the most receptive audience.","1894","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"
"""It's pretty logical where these conversations are clustered,"" said Julia Smekalina with the digital consulting firm IMGE. The maps represent ""home states or states where they held office … states where they are very prominent."" But Smekalina notes that the Day One impact fades in relevance very quickly. ""The goal should be long-term engagement with your key audiences."" She suggests the more important goal for this period of the presidential campaign is building a strong social media presence in key battleground states and early primary states.","1895","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"
"But there are also some oddities worth noting. With lots of political conversation centered in Washington, it is perhaps not surprising it is one of the top five places for most of the entrants thus far. But Huckabee, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Carson did not dominate the conversation in the nation's capital — perhaps because they are not seen as top contenders by folks inside the Beltway.","1896","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"

"The data are not sorted by sentiment, said Kelli Matthews, an instructor at the University of Oregon, so it is not clear whether all of the chatter about the candidates is favorable. But she notes that Fiorina's former company, Hewlett-Packard, has a major facility in Corvallis, Ore., which may explain why her entry into the race would generate conversation there.","1898","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/facebook-geography-white-house-2016/28062221/"

In fact, law school applications just keep falling. Right now, the optimistic view is that, after several years of decline, they've finally hit bottom. Many schools are cutting enrollment. Others are cutting faculty salaries and research stipends.","3:01 p.m. EDT June 29, 2015","1966","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/29/law-school-decline-industry-transformation-column/29456369/"

"Brian Tamanaha's book, Failing Law Schools, predicted this several years ago. Tuition, he noted, was climbing even as employment opportunities for graduates were shrinking. These two trends couldn't continue forever, and they haven't. A more recent book, Deborah Rhode's The Trouble With Lawyers, notes similar problems. But many Americans, seeing lawyers as a source of litigation, economic stagnation and bureaucracy, may feel that America would be better off with fewer lawyers.","1968","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/29/law-school-decline-industry-transformation-column/29456369/"
"And to some degree, they may be right. America probably is, as Walter Olson's blog of the same name suggests, Overlawyered. But it may also be true that the real problem isn't that we have too many lawyers, but that they are too expensive.","1969","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/29/law-school-decline-industry-transformation-column/29456369/"
"That's the view taken in my colleague Benjamin Barton's new book, Glass Half Full: The Decline And Rebirth of the Legal Profession, out this month from Oxford University Press. Barton notes that high-end law firms are being squeezed by much-greater client sensitivity to costs, and by technology that lets one junior attorney do the work of ten when reviewing documents. (Increased efficiency isn't a plus when you bill by the hour.) Likewise, lawyers at the bottom end are being squeezed by online legal form services like LegalZoom or Rocket Lawyer. Still, he sees some upsides for lawyers and clients alike.","1970","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/29/law-school-decline-industry-transformation-column/29456369/"
"For lawyers, he sees incomes falling to the more-modest levels that prevailed before the 1980-2000 legal boom. Lower incomes are bad, of course, but it's also true that prior to the boom, lawyers were happier with their work. Crushing workloads, dog-eat-dog firm politics and fickle clients made the boom time much more stressful. The move to billing arrangements that focus on results, not hours worked, saves clients money, but it also changes the way lawyers work, probably for the better.","1971","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/29/law-school-decline-industry-transformation-column/29456369/"
"Meanwhile, while technology is hurting firms' income, it's also cutting their expenses, and making life easier (in some ways) for solo practitioners. I have a former student who practices family law and doesn't even keep an office. Her clients like it that she makes house calls, and she saves big on overhead. Email, voicemail and the like are better than a secretary, and online legal research is better than maintaining a law library.","1972","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/29/law-school-decline-industry-transformation-column/29456369/"
"Clients, meanwhile, will get cheaper legal services. There's a limit to how much lawyers can cut their rates — those student loan debts have to be paid, and if you can't make enough to pay them practicing law, you're better off doing something else — but many tech startups are looking at ways to provide legal services more cheaply and efficiently than the old model ever did. Barton is optimistic about that, and I hope he's right.","1973","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/29/law-school-decline-industry-transformation-column/29456369/"
"At any rate, law, as the ultimate white-collar job, is now undergoing what so many other fields have suffered before: Technological unemployment and a shrinking economic pie. Lawyers, who probably didn't shed a lot of tears when this happened to linotype operators, will just have to deal with it as well. I hope that Ben Barton's mostly-cheerful predictions turn out to be right.","1974","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/29/law-school-decline-industry-transformation-column/29456369/"

He underscored his remarks with a visit to a federal prison — a first for a sitting president — and the commutation of 46 nonviolent drug offenders’ prison sentences.","6 a.m. EDT August 2, 2015","1978","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/31/obama-criminal-justice-reform-jail/30577851/"
"As head of the nation’s largest prisoner outreach, I applaud the president and the many other leaders who are spearheading this issue. With 2.3 million Americans behind bars, this is a problem overdue for examination. President Obama advanced the national dialog. But of everything he said last week, his most profound statement came in the form of a cliché offered to reporters after he met several prisoners. “There but for the grace of God,” he observed.","1979","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/31/obama-criminal-justice-reform-jail/30577851/"
"When I bring friends into prison with me, they often have a similar reaction. The expectation of encountering “monsters” like those on TV falls away. Fear, one of the main factors in support for “cuff ‘em and stuff ‘em” law enforcement, is replaced by the reality of people who, surprisingly, remind them of a friend or relative. They begin to realize that the best of us are only one bad choice away from prison, and the worst of us might never have gone there under different circumstances.","1980","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/31/obama-criminal-justice-reform-jail/30577851/"
"This realization can be unsettling. It would be more comfortable to believe that prisons are full of dangerous people who need to be locked up forever in the interest of public safety — as is true in some cases. But I have come to realize that we are imprisoning enormous potential, too. With help, people behind bars can make important contributions. They can come home as “good neighbors.” But until we incorporate an appreciation of their human dignity into prison reform, few will have that opportunity.","1981","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/31/obama-criminal-justice-reform-jail/30577851/"
"Many of the blind spots in our criminal justice system could be resolved if we spent time reflecting on the experiences of the people involved. Crime itself starts with an empathy deficit. Those who commit crimes often lack empathy for their victims, viewing them as means to their desired ends. A drug dealer avoids thinking about how his customers’ families are destroyed. But the perpetrators of crimes are not the only ones who have lacked empathy. When policymakers lose sight of victims’ experiences, they are left to navigate the aftermath of crimes with few resources and little hope for closure. And when we give long sentences to people whose crimes could be dealt with in other ways, not pausing to consider the cost to their families and communities, we wind up with overflowing prisons.","1982","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/31/obama-criminal-justice-reform-jail/30577851/"
"The good news is that greater empathy, paired with prudent policy, can help bring about meaningful change. When I speak to prisoners who are enrolled in character reformation programming, they agree that if they had understood the true cost to their victims, they would have been less likely to commit their crimes. As they go through intensive classes that, alongside other skills, help build empathy, they become less likely to commit new crimes.","1983","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/31/obama-criminal-justice-reform-jail/30577851/"
"Empathy for those most affected by crime and incarceration can also aid the process of reform. By keeping the human face of criminal justice at the center, we can adopt a more restorative stance, one that respects victims, engages the community and holds perpetrators accountable while offering them a chance to regain trust. Already, state and federal leaders are pursuing restorative approaches that are proving more effective at reducing the number of new crimes—and new victims—than longer prison sentences.","1984","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/31/obama-criminal-justice-reform-jail/30577851/"
"There will always be prisons, and some people will make choices that eliminate any chance of freedom. But as many people as possible should be given a chance to learn from their mistakes, regain trust and contribute to their communities. To do that, they need a corrections system that is oriented toward restoration, so that instead of prolonged idleness, “doing time” becomes a crossroads of transformation. The CORRECTIONS Act, introduced in Congress this year, would allow some prisoners to earn shorter sentences by preparing themselves to go home. It is just one example of a prison reform bill that would move us toward a new, restorative paradigm. After decades of mandatory minimums and other policies that have overcrowded our prisons, many reforms are gaining traction, but they will not succeed without voters’ unified support.","1985","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/31/obama-criminal-justice-reform-jail/30577851/"
"It’s our job to push for these changes, demanding a criminal justice system that helps repair what crime has broken. On the worst day of our lives, you, I, or someone we love might find ourselves thrown into the criminal justice system — either as defendants, victims or as the communities that surround them. We should start by understanding the experiences of these groups and then we should design the kind of fair, restorative system we would want for ourselves. Because there, but for the grace of God, goes each of us.","1986","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/31/obama-criminal-justice-reform-jail/30577851/"

"The United States is a nation of race shifters. Americans project a myriad of racial and ethnic identities on a daily basis. Race shifting is not new. Since the earliest days of colonial America, people of European descent have tailored their self identity to meet the needs of the moment.","2040","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/17/race-identity-dolezal-american-indians-column/28801139/"
"As the controversy surrounding the racial identity of the former leader of the Spokane NAACP, Rachel Dolezal, reminds us, on rare occasions some white Americans adopt a black identity. Historically, white Americans who make the choice to assume a black identity rarely do so to work for social justice organizations. Typically the performance of a black identity is done not to assert one's ""trans-racial"" progressivism, but to ridicule black Americans. From the minstrel shows that entertained white working class audiences in the nineteenth century to the Hollywood films of the early twentieth century, ""black face"" performances have long constituted the ultimate expression of white privilege and racial power.","2041","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/17/race-identity-dolezal-american-indians-column/28801139/"
"In other ways, Dolezal's contrived racial identity is more commonplace. In an interview with The Easterner in February 2015, Dolezal claimed she'd been born in a ""tepee"" and spent parts of her childhood hunting for food with a ""bow and arrow."" Her allusions to an American Indian ancestry is a fairly routine form of race shifting in the United States. A recent study by the Pew Research Center highlights how race shifting remains part of American culture. Specifically, the Pew study highlighted how 68% of all adult mixed-race Americans claim American Indian ancestry. Those with White/Native American ancestry alone are half of all mixed-race adults.","2042","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/17/race-identity-dolezal-american-indians-column/28801139/"
"So what's going on here? Pew's findings shed light on a cultural phenomenon that American Indians are all too aware of: the ever-growing population of ""Wannabe Indians.""","2043","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/17/race-identity-dolezal-american-indians-column/28801139/"
"Generations of white Americans have asserted their white privilege by sliding into, and out of, ""red face"" personas. Our colonial forebears did it — think of the ""Sons of Liberty"" during the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Shortly after its founding in 1910, the Boy Scouts of Americastarted its Order of the Arrow honors society, which involves ceremonies where members dress up and pretend to be ""Indians."" And collegiate and professional sports teams have an inglorious history of appropriating American Indian imagery for their mascots.","2044","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/17/race-identity-dolezal-american-indians-column/28801139/"
"When white Americans appropriate the symbols of American Indian culture or affect an indigenous identity, they are often adopting what they imagine is a more ""authentic"" form of personal identification. And right there, they have a problem. Being American Indian is historically about being part of a community, of participating in the reciprocal responsibilities that come with belonging to a kinship group. Too often, white Americans glibly claim to be descended from Pocahontas, or more commonly, a ""Cherokee grandmother.""","2045","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/17/race-identity-dolezal-american-indians-column/28801139/"
"It's easy to dismiss this type of race shifting, but should we? The Cherokee people, for example, have a long history of migrating and resettling in new communities in their Southeastern homelands and in the trans-Mississippi West that stretches back to the 18thcentury, through to the Trail of Tears in the 19th century, and into the 20th century. It's not unreasonable to imagine Cherokee people forming attachments, and sometimes marrying, white people. However, in claiming a mixed white-Cherokee identity (or any multiracial indigenous identity for that matter), many white Americans are not reflecting on the complex and often violent history that accompanied Cherokee migration; instead, they're trivializing and simplifying Cherokee history and culture.","2046","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/17/race-identity-dolezal-american-indians-column/28801139/"
"For instance, to claim, as many Americans have over the years, descent from a Cherokee ""princess""— a contrived invention of American culture — is to declare one's self a ""Native American."" It's an appeal for recognition as an ""authentic"" native of the United States. In reality, it's the use of ""red face"" to assert a modern form of white privilege.","2047","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/17/race-identity-dolezal-american-indians-column/28801139/"
"The historian Philip Deloria refers to the appropriation of an American Indian identity as ""playing Indian."" And it's not just individual Americans who indulge in this practice. Historian Tiya Miles has shown that in the decades after World War Two, the Georgia Historical Commission embarked on a marketing campaign to attract tourists to the newly restored Vann house, the former home of a prominent Cherokee family of slave owners. The Commission conflated Georgia's secession from the Union in 1861 with the forced removal of the Cherokees in 1838 and 1839. ​This forging of a shared political kinship was just that: a forgery. It overlooked the simple historical fact that the government and white settlers of Georgia were every bit as involved in dispossessing the Cherokees of their homeland as the federal government.","2048","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/17/race-identity-dolezal-american-indians-column/28801139/"
"The United States is a racially diverse place and as such race shifting will undoubtedly continue during the twenty-first century. If our country's recent history is any guide, such choices are not harmless.

"If you haven’t seen the videos about Planned Parenthood’s operation to harvest human body parts from abortions, I suggest you view them. It might change your mind about whether taxpayers should help fund Planned Parenthood.","5:26 p.m. EDT August 2, 2015","2052","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/02/planned-parenthood-defund-senate-editorials-debates/31019651/"
"While our nation is divided on abortion, we shouldn’t force the taxes of Americans who strongly oppose organ harvesting or abortion to continue to fund an organization that carries out these inhumane practices. About 40% of Planned Parenthood’s funding comes from hardworking taxpayers, which leaves its other resources available to perform these barbaric procedures.","2053","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/02/planned-parenthood-defund-senate-editorials-debates/31019651/"
"The videos bring up legal questions of whether Planned Parenthood complies with federal laws regulating the use of fetal tissue, alteration of procedures used to terminate pregnancies, the purpose of obtaining tissue and partial-birth abortion procedures. At the very least, federal funding should cease while an investigation occurs.","2054","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/02/planned-parenthood-defund-senate-editorials-debates/31019651/"
"Many Americans believe these unborn lives are fully human. When Planned Parenthood sells unique human organs to research labs, by definition, they had to be unique human lives when they were aborted. These organs cannot be “just tissue” in the womb, but later sold as the liver, heart or brain of humans.","2055","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/02/planned-parenthood-defund-senate-editorials-debates/31019651/"

"Donald Trump","2061","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: He has tapped into growing voter anger about the failure of government to do anything well. Trump must offer specifics on domestic and foreign policy. I’d also like to know how and why he converted from pro-choice to pro-life in 2011. He has changed positions on other issues. Expediency or “conversion”? Question: You talk tough about world leaders you say you would confront, but why should any of them, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Chinese, respect you?","2062","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: Trump is doing well, not for who he is or what he stands for, but rather for who he isn’t and what he’s against. Trump has captured the mood of many Republican voters who are fed up with politicians in Washington, including GOP members of Congress, and want Congress to know it. Trump does that for them. Conservative voters are frustrated that Obamacare is still alive and that more undocumented workers continue to cross the border. Trump is against Obamacare and for sealing the border. What’s not to like?","2063","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Jeb Bush","2064","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: He should reiterate he is not his father or brother and say how a Bush (III) presidency will be different from the other Presidents Bush. Make a convincing case for immigration reform that includes a plan to first stem the tide of illegal aliens flooding our borders. “Compassion” won’t cut it. Most conservatives want it stopped. He also must convince voters why he thinks the federal government through Common Core can do a better job educating kids than locals. Question: What does “conservative” mean to you in terms of policy, and what are some issues on which you would never compromise?","2065","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: He can run, but he can’t hide from it. Jeb needs to achieve two goals. The first is to get by Iowa and New Hampshire. To do that he needs to stand firm on pro-life issues and small government. He has already broken with George W. on Iraq, which is good, but he cannot be soft on immigration. Once he gets by the first two states, the field will shrink, and he can get to South Carolina and Florida, where he needs to put away Sen. Marco Rubio.","2066","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Scott Walker","2067","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: The base loves him because he stood up to massive union money and outside groups coming into Wisconsin attempting to stop his efforts to break public unions. According to the latest publicpolicypolling.com survey, Walker is favored by 17% of GOP voters, just behind Trump’s 19% and ahead of Bush’s 12%. Question: The last time there was a Republican president and a Republican Congress, relatively little got done. What would your top priorities be with a GOP Congress, and how would you get them through?","2068","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: Many love him in Iowa because he is a neighbor, but he should beware. He will need to win Iowa big to get momentum going into New Hampshire, where his anti-union positions will largely be welcomed. I managed Fritz Mondale’s presidential campaign and they loved him in Iowa, where he won almost 50% against a large Democratic field and went on to lose New Hampshire. On every question, try to work in an Iowa angle. Iowans will be watching!","2069","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Marco Rubio","2070","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: Push any button from foreign to domestic policy and Rubio instantly “plays back” a stream of sound bites loaded with statistics and history. He represents a new generation and could say with credibility that older people have had their chance, let’s try something new — him. Question: You have spoken of the need for Social Security and Medicare reform. George W. Bush tried Social Security reform and was demagogued by the left into submission. How would you reform those programs and respond to heat from Democrats and the news media about “killing granny”?","2071","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: That’s an excellent question, because Social Security and Medicare reform has backfired almost every time it has been suggested. The problem Rubio has by emphasizing the “new generation” is that GOP primary voters skew older than the national median age, And they vote. Work into the debate the contributions of older Americans and your determination to protect them. Rubio has lots of senior support. Put them on buses and send them to Iowa and New Hampshire. No charge for the advice, Senator.","2072","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Ted Cruz","2073","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: Gets credit from the base for his 21-hour speech on the Senate floor against Obamacare. Openly Christian. Disliked by members of both parties in the Senate (not necessarily a negative because much of the country dislikes all of Congress). Question: According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, “One-fifth of the U.S. public — and a third of adults under 30 — are religiously unaffiliated.” How do you reach these people who might be turned off by you religious zeal?","2074","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: Sure, Cruz gets some credit for his filibuster — Obamacare has survived and is gaining popularity. Candidates for president who wear their faith on their sleeves are treading in dangerous waters. The conservative religious community may not doubt Cruz’s faith, but it cannot believe he will win. A good question for the senator: You have been firm on issues you oppose, what issues do you like that have been ignored by Washington?","2075","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Rand Paul","2076","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: Strong libertarian/conservative. Gets some support because of his father, Ron Paul. Must explain why he is reluctant to confront enemies like the Islamic State and Iran. Question: If you knew that Iran was about to finish a nuclear weapon and a ballistic missile to deliver it, what would you do to stop them? A follow-up question: If you wait until we are attacked before confronting our enemies, won’t it be too late?","2077","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB:Many people, including Republican voters, believe that the U.S. has spilled enough blood and treasure in overseas conflicts. Voters don’t get up each day and think about Iran. They think about the needs here at home and want their leaders to address them. If asked about the U.S. role overseas, Paul should be firm on his insistence that we not play world cop and focus on America’s needs.","2078","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"Chris Christie","2079","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"CAL: If Christie’s first years as New Jersey governor were a political honeymoon, these days it’s more like a separation agreement. Positives: Great speaker with strong stage presence; disciplined enough to take advice and lose weight; high name recognition. Negatives: See first sentence. Question: What happened?","2080","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: Chris Christie’s problem is Chris Christie. I agree he’s an exciting speaker, and his “in your face” approach to campaigning reflects the mood of Republican-base voters. The problem is Christie is really a moderate from New Jersey, and in GOP primary politics, moderates need not apply. He also has a trust problem. The George Washington Bridge scandal has tainted Christie’s reputation for truth-telling —although he has never faced charges. And in 2012, according to Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s book Double Down, Christie did not fill out all his background forms when Mitt Romney was considering Christie for vice president. Wonder why?","2081","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"

"CAL: He has a good record as Ohio governor. The economy has had a major turnaround. Unemployment is down. The conservative base doesn’t like his support of Medicaid expansion, and he has backed Common Core. He also has the irritating habit of lecturing fellow Republicans.","2083","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: I spoke to Kasich on Sunday night. He called to wish me a fast recovery from my back operation. He was in New Hampshire and he was feeling good about making the debate cut. Kasich has had a solid record as Ohio’s governor and he’s a good campaigner. My question is he conservative enough for the GOP base?","2084","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"

"CAL: I put them together because they basically have the same message. They are speaking “righteousness” to an “unrighteous” nation. See above poll on the “nones.” Question for both: At what point would you consider dropping out if it appeared your presence was damaging the eventual nominee?","2086","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-presidential-debate-common-ground/31122863/"
"BOB: You pose a good question and with some history in religion and politics to back it up. In 2008 and 2012 respectively, Huckabee stayed in the race well past his sell-by date. He convinced himself he were on a lonely mission to save the soul of America. Only God can do that.

"President Obama visited American University today to deliver what was billed as one of the most important speeches of his presidency. The topic was the proposed nuclear deal with Iran that is currently under consideration by the Congress. The venue was significant; Obama invoked history, namely President John F. Kennedy’s June 10, 1963 commencement speech in which he announced that the United States, Soviet Union and United Kingdom would begin formal negotiations seeking a limited nuclear test ban. But Kennedy’s diplomatic success 52 years ago only underscores Obama’s poor showing in selling his nuclear deal with Iran.","5:11 p.m. EDT August 5, 2015","2149","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/obama-american-university-speech-iran-deal-column/31166849/"
"Kennedy sought a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing, which both sides had undertaken extensively and which created nuclear fallout problems. He negotiated the test ban as a formal treaty, and presented it to the Senate for ratification as the Constitution dictates. It sailed through in September 1963 by a vote of 80 to 19 with strong bipartisan support. By contrast, the Obama administration never sought to do the hard work of negotiating and ratifying a formal treaty with Iran, and the proposed pact faces strong bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill. President Obama invoked the later SALT agreements with the Soviet Union, but his proposed Iran deal has lower public approval than the SALT II treaty did before Jimmy Carter withdrew it from the Senate in 1980.(","2150","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/obama-american-university-speech-iran-deal-column/31166849/"
"President Kennedy's speech was publicly addressing Soviet strongman Nikita Khrushchev (who notably said “We will bury you”) in an attempt to get him to the negotiating table. President Obama's speech today targeted a small group of undecided members of his own political party who could mean the difference between his deal being rejected with a veto proof majority, or simply being rejected.","2151","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/obama-american-university-speech-iran-deal-column/31166849/"
"Kennedy was also not afraid to continue his pointed criticism of Soviet communism even while he sought détente. Two weeks after the American University address, Kennedy delivered his more famous, more combative “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech. “There are some who say in Europe and elsewhere we can work with the Communists,” Kennedy said. “Let them come to Berlin.” Kennedy’s muscular tone prompted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to remark during his own speech in East Berlin two days later that ""one would think that the speeches were made by two different Presidents."" Obama made passing reference to Iran’s Islamic regime being repressive, but it hardly amounted to the soaring indictment of communism President Kennedy made in Berlin.","2152","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/obama-american-university-speech-iran-deal-column/31166849/"
"Kennedy was concerned that the Soviet Union might possibly start a senseless conflict, but Obama believes that his domestic political opponents are the ones threatening to start a senseless conflict. He characterized his deal as a peace agreement, because there is “no other option” than a U.S.-initiated war — even though no American leaders are advocating an immediate attack.","2153","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/obama-american-university-speech-iran-deal-column/31166849/"
"Obama is manufacturing a crisis that his pact does not solve. The agreement does not address Iran’s expansionist aims, its support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program or grim human rights record. Even if the proposed deal worked, which is doubtful, it would amount to a speed bump for Iran’s nuclear program that will simultaneously reward Tehran with tens of billions of dollars to invigorate its terror networks and missile programs.","2154","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/obama-american-university-speech-iran-deal-column/31166849/"
"President Obama quoted Kennedy saying that “the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war.” But Obama's argument that war is the only alternative is what is creating drama. There are many better alternatives to his Iran pact that do not involve armed conflict. The stakes are much lower than they were in 1963. This is not the height of the Cold War. Iran is not the Soviet Union. And Barack Obama, is no John F. Kennedy.","2155","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/05/obama-american-university-speech-iran-deal-column/31166849/"

Its principal difference is found in the church’s name: Seventh-day Adventists worship on what we believe is the Bible Sabbath, the seventh day of the week called “Saturday” in English, but referred to as “Sabbath” in over 100 other languages, including Spanish, “Sabado.” The Adventist part? We believe Jesus is returning soon, although we have never set a specific date.","2198","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/26/seventh-day-adventist-trump-carson-column/74647308/"
"The church and its members also respect and take counsel from the writings of Ellen White, who we believe exercised the biblical gift of prophecy during her decades of public ministry. But we don’t worship White or her writings, nor do they substitute for the Bible. “Brethren and sisters, I commend unto you this Book,” were White’s final public words, referring to the Bible she held in her hands, at a 1909 meeting of Adventist leaders. (She died six years later.)","2199","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/26/seventh-day-adventist-trump-carson-column/74647308/"
"Not only do Adventists rely on the Bible as the final word on issues of doctrine, but we also work diligently to protect religious liberty. We’ve been to court on behalf of Sabbath-keepers, and filed a brief supporting Samantha Elauf, the Muslim woman refused a sales job by retailer Aberchrombie & Fitch because she wore a hijab. Adventists believe religious liberty belongs to all people, everywhere.","2200","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/26/seventh-day-adventist-trump-carson-column/74647308/"

"A few days before Labor Day, as Americans prepared for the end of summer, we learned that some 300,000 U.S. veterans might have died while waiting for health care at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Yet due to “generally unreliable” VA data and ineffective systems, even this critical statistic could not be confirmed.","4:49 p.m. EDT September 14, 2015","2227","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/ben-carson-president-reform-veterans-administration-column/72219124/"
"These disturbing findings, revealed in a report by the agency’s inspector general, confirm the urgency for VA reform. When it comes to veterans care, Americans are rightfully outraged, and can no longer be content with business as usual: We must seek — and our veterans deserve — real improvements that are bold and long-lasting.","2228","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/ben-carson-president-reform-veterans-administration-column/72219124/"
"During my career as a neurosurgeon, I worked at VA hospitals as a medical student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and again in Baltimore. Both my internship and residency at Johns Hopkins involved actual patient care as well as supervising resident physicians attending at VA hospital facilities. I sat at the bedside of many veterans and witnessed their selflessness, their sacrifice and their need for extraordinary care. Their anguish was my anguish.","2229","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/ben-carson-president-reform-veterans-administration-column/72219124/"
"Today, while many committed leaders and servants toil at the VA, its performance is marred by incompetence and corruption bred by structural impediments and bureaucratic indifference. The astonishing findings of public and private audits have turned out to be much worse than anyone suspected. In May of last year, Americans discovered that VA employees across the country had falsified and manipulated patient appointment records — leaving veterans seeking treatment in long or futile waiting lines while the employees themselves were receiving fat bonuses. After the scandal, a new VA secretary, Robert McDonald, pledged to clean house, but as of February this year, nearly a year after the scandal came to light, only eight employees out of more than 340,000 on the VA’s payroll had been fired for their role in manipulating wait times. Even Mr. McDonald, one of the finest corporate executives and management figures in America, could not break the logjam of dysfunction at the bureaucratic behemoth.","2230","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/ben-carson-president-reform-veterans-administration-column/72219124/"
"Meanwhile, decades of effort and billions of taxpayer dollars have been thrown at “fixing” the VA, and the results have been abysmal. The backlog of veterans waiting for treatment or disability classification is stupendous, and drives them to frustration and even desperation. The lack of integrated records management continues to defy the millions of IT dollars that have poured into the agency. Continuity of care from the Department of Defense to the VA is often non-existent, and malpractice within the VA system is underreported and often unaccountable. Even the simplest tasks of refilling prescriptions and getting preventive medical checks are inordinately difficult. Instead of making the military-to-civilian transition more seamless, the VA has made it more arduous.","2231","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/ben-carson-president-reform-veterans-administration-column/72219124/"
"Additionally, the VA’s health system has not adapted to meet the changing needs of our veteran population. While tremendous advancements in battlefield medicine and treatment have occurred during the nation's decade plus at war, the VA hews to an antiquated health system that does not take into account changing veteran demographics, increased severity of non-lethal injuries, a more transient veteran population, enhanced civilian medical technologies or increased need for connectivity in the information age.","2232","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/ben-carson-president-reform-veterans-administration-column/72219124/"

"These failures cannot stand. The VA is like the federal version of the Department of Motor Vehicles: inefficient, incompetent and infuriating. Except the VA is much worse: at least the DMV’s long wait times do not kill its applicants.","2234","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/ben-carson-president-reform-veterans-administration-column/72219124/"
"At a minimum, the Veterans Health Administration (the entity in the VA that provides health care) should be eliminated to forge a 21st century veterans health care solution. Such a significant organizational change no doubt requires further study and consideration, and I will be providing more details in the weeks and months to come. Meanwhile, the following improvements can and should be made immediately. The health of our brave men and women veterans deserve no less.","2235","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/09/14/ben-carson-president-reform-veterans-administration-column/72219124/"

"Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate, spoke at a rally on Sept. 22 at Cedarville University — an Ohio school that describes itself as a ""Christ-centered, Baptist institution.""

"Carson talked about entropy, which is commonly thought of as a measure of order or disorder; increasing entropy essentially means an increasingly disordered state. The second law of thermodynamics says that in any isolated system, the entropy of that system will increase or remain the same — not decrease.","2383","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-ben-carson-rewrites-laws-thermodynamics/72752898/"

"One good example of this is an ice tray in a freezer. The molecules in liquid water move into a more ordered state when they freeze into a solid. On its own then, water turning to ice appears to be a violation of the second law. But the ice in the freezer is not a closed system: The freezer also generates heat as it runs, which is radiated out into your kitchen. That heat increases entropy more than the water turning to ice decreases it.","2386","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-ben-carson-rewrites-laws-thermodynamics/72752898/"

"Moving outward to the solar system scale, the situation is the same. The increasing entropy is not violated by the formation of planets, stars and comets due to arrive in 70 years. All the factors that go into the formation of these celestial bodies work to increase disorder rather than decrease it. As Greene told us: ""The formation of a star is an entropically increasing phenomenon. It is not decreasing the amount of disorder, it is increasing the amount of disorder, even though it looks so darn ordered relative to, say, the swirling gas cloud from which it emerged.""","2388","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-ben-carson-rewrites-laws-thermodynamics/72752898/"
"Planets and stars form when gases and dust in space slow down and begin to clump together, at which point gravity helps pull these clumps together and draw in more dust and gas, until those big objects are formed. ""That process as we understand it is completely consistent with the second law of thermodynamics,"" Greene said.","2389","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-ben-carson-rewrites-laws-thermodynamics/72752898/"
"From a universe-wide perspective, the overall increasing entropy is measurable based on the leftover heat from the Big Bang, known as the cosmic microwave background radiation. According to the Big Bang theory, at the point of the initial explosion all the energy in the universe was concentrated in a state of very low entropy — an almost completely ordered state. Ever since that explosion, that energy has been spreading out, a continually rising degree of disorder. The observed level of the background radiation is consistent with the predictions of modern cosmology. In short, Big Bang theory predicts the existence of and the specific amounts of background radiation as a result of the rising entropy of the entire system, and observations actually bear that out. ""The calculations agree with the observations to fantastic precision,"" Greene said.","2390","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-ben-carson-rewrites-laws-thermodynamics/72752898/"
"Carson went on to claim that the presence of stars and planets is related to the existence of multiple Big Bangs that eventually might produce an ordered universe:","2391","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-ben-carson-rewrites-laws-thermodynamics/72752898/"
"That is not an accurate reflection of the Big Bang theory. Though some theories of the origin of the universe suggest that the Big Bang was only one of many such explosions, these theories do not state that the currently ordered existence is a spontaneous result of one of these repeated Big Bangs. Greene called this a ""red herring,"" and said the concept of multiple Big Bangs has nothing to do with how stars and planets form in this current universe. Instead, those theories involve the idea that the universe goes through cycles over many billions of years: Big Bang, expansion, contraction, ""Big Crunch,"" followed by another Big Bang. How the stars and planets form between each of those bangs and crunches is a separate issue.","2392","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/24/fact-check-ben-carson-rewrites-laws-thermodynamics/72752898/"

Carson has also condemned socialized medicine. Dr. Carson knows we must support Israel or America is finished as a world power. Carson disagrees with Obama picking Iran and the ayatollahs over our one true friend in the Middle East, Israel. Carson believes that all lives matter. Dr. Carson believes the babies, not fetuses but babies, lives in the womb matter. Carson has operated many times on babies still in the womb so that they can see daylight soon. Carson believes that he was operating on a human being inside the womb. Carson believes that turning a blind eye to illegal immigration is a country committing suicide. Because of all these many values that Carson believes in, many Americans are beginning to believe in Carson. Carson is an unapologetic, God fearing, flag waving, humble American.

"It’s a small man who delights in the misfortune of others, but I can’t help myself.

"After months of attempting to marginalize him as a fringe candidate who would fade quickly in the crowded Republican presidential field, liberals are having to come to grips with the reality that Carson is a legitimate contender. And it isn’t going over well.","2581","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/27/heck-ben-carson-strikes-fear-left/74681542/"
"Why? It proves that liberals’ habit of screaming “racist” at any person who opposed the presidency of Barack Obama has been as wrong as it was despicable. It turns out that Republicans don’t mind electing a black president – they just haven’t enjoyed a liberal one.","2582","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/27/heck-ben-carson-strikes-fear-left/74681542/"

"As the party of big government, liberals have enacted policies that have locked blacks into failing inner-city schools, ended scholarship programs designed to help black children excel, facilitated a dangerous dependency that has led to an epidemic of fatherless black homes, encouraged an influx of illegal immigrants who have disproportionately deprived young black men of jobs, and funded a “family planning” strategy that has disproportionately harmed black communities.","2584","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/27/heck-ben-carson-strikes-fear-left/74681542/"
"If you are tempted to excuse those offenses as unintentional or coincidental, note that both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are disciples of leftist icon Saul Alinsky. It was Alinsky who articulated the strategy that in order to control a group of people, they “must feel so frustrated, so defeated, so lost, so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing.” While gutting the black community with their policies, Democrats have managed to portray themselves as blacks’ only hope.","2585","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/27/heck-ben-carson-strikes-fear-left/74681542/"
"Alinsky continued, “The despair is there; now it's up to us to go in and rub raw the sores of discontent, galvanize them for radical social change. We'll give them a way to participate in the democratic process, a way to exercise their rights as citizens and strike back at the establishment that oppresses them.” If this doesn’t describe the behavior of Democratic political activists, I don’t know what does.","2586","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/27/heck-ben-carson-strikes-fear-left/74681542/"
"But that scheme is upended by the emergence of a self-made member of the oppressed group – one who rose to prominence without the crutch of liberal social programs, and who articulates the inherent danger and destructive nature of their bloated existence. Meet Ben Carson, a man born into the crucible of inner-city strife, but who escaped the cycle of poverty to become a brilliant neurosurgeon.","2587","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/27/heck-ben-carson-strikes-fear-left/74681542/"
"Carson’s message of a smaller government, self-reliance and Christian faith offer a stark contrast to the grievance mongering and victim mentality promoted for decades by Democrats. The good doctor praises the existence of government safety nets but deplores the use of dependency programs for political ends. Consequently, the same people that have claimed for years to be the champions of minorities are doing all they can to stop one from succeeding.","2588","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/27/heck-ben-carson-strikes-fear-left/74681542/"
"When you come to believe that people must think a certain way simply because of their skin color, and you despise them when they don’t, you are the one with the race problem. That is the uncomfortable truth Ben Carson’s candidacy is revealing, and it’s why the left will stop at nothing to destroy him.","2589","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/27/heck-ben-carson-strikes-fear-left/74681542/"

"Major newspaper editorials and some columnists have their knickers in a twist over remarks by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson. Appearing last Sunday on “Meet the Press,” Carson was asked by host Chuck Todd whether he believes Islam is consistent with the Constitution. “No, I don’t,” he said. “I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.” Asked whether he could vote for a Muslim for Congress, Carson said Congress is a different story, but that it “depends on who that Muslim is and what their policies are.”","2627","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/09/26/thomas-ben-carsons-warning/72894304/"

"If you prefer the thoughts of a cultural icon, consider what singer Art Garfunkel said. As reported on DailyMail.com, Garfunkel noted that Muslims are transforming Europe. He referenced “Reflections of the Revolution in Europe,” a 2009 book by Christopher Caldwell, which argues, “that mass immigration by Muslims is altering the culture of Europe because of their reluctance to join the culture of their new homelands.” The book claims Muslims do not so much enhance European culture as supplant it, and are “patiently conquering Europe’s cities, street by street.”","2630","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/09/26/thomas-ben-carsons-warning/72894304/"

"But the news isn’t all bad for Trump, who fell to second in two polls of likely caucus attendees last week. The real estate mogul is still seen as the party’s best hope for bringing about real change, the Iowa Poll shows, and that may be the most important qualification for a Republican candidate in this period of political frustration and disaffection.","2699","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/24/iowa-poll-carson-seen-electable-trump-change-agent/74552624/"

"So far as I know, no neurosurgeon has ever written a book about the U.S. Constitution. But then again, no neurosurgeon has ever made a serious run for the presidency. Combining personal graciousness and plain exposition with some wild right-wing clichés, Ben Carson’s slim volume tells us a lot about the sources of his appeal. Like the man himself, the book is not what you might expect.","12:10 a.m. EDT October 25, 2015","2724","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"Carson is unmistakably outraged by the direction in which the U.S. has been heading. “Our nation,” he writes, “is in such shambles that it appears that almost anyone could do a better job of execution than the current leaders.” It would have been easy for him to take the well-trodden path of those who share that view. Some popular books on the Constitution tell a terrifying tale of betrayal, in which Democrats (and President Barack Obama in particular) have run roughshod over the framers’ handiwork in order to create a kind of empire.","2725","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"Carson has evident sympathy for that account, but his approach is far more measured and less polemical. His main goal is education and exposition, not conversion. Much of the book consists of simple summary.","2726","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"Curious about the thirteenth amendment? It “ended slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States and all its territories.” (True.) Interested in the twenty-second amendment? “After Roosevelt’s death, Americans worried that he had set a bad precedent, and Congress proposed a term-limit amendment.” (Essentially right.) The qualifications for president? You have to “be a natural-born citizen, be at least 35 years old, and have been a resident of the United States for at least 14 years.” (Right again.)","2727","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"But in his unfailingly low-key manner, Carson has some amazing things to say. He appears to think that the Constitution forbids progressive taxation, because the founders “didn’t mean that the government should take money from one group to support another group.” In his account, “a flat tax may be the only tax that truly treats everyone fairly and thus promotes the general welfare.” In the view of some tax reformers on the right, maybe so, but as a claim about constitutional law, that’s pretty far-fetched.","2728","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"With respect to abortion, Carson gestures toward the plausible idea that state governments should be allowed to decide the issue as they like. But his real conclusion is far more radical. Because children’s lives are at stake, the Constitution actually forbids abortion: “No ruling that allows the killing of children can be in line with the Constitution’s stated purpose of ‘secur[ing] the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.’” Welcome back to the land of the far-fetched. No member of the Supreme Court has ever argued that the Constitution requires states to ban abortions.","2729","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"Carson doesn’t like executive orders, saying they may be used “only rarely and in circumstances where such quick action is required that congressional action is not feasible.” Really? President Ronald Reagan issued over 300 executive orders, and President Dwight Eisenhower issued over 400, and Herbert Hoover 900. The overwhelming majority of these do not attempt to deal with with emergencies. They tend to involve management of the executive branch or policy direction to executive agencies within the confines of the law. Nothing in the Constitution stands in the way of executive orders of that kind.","2730","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"Carson really doesn’t like gun control. Offering a more elaborate version of his widely publicized remarks on CNN, he writes that “German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s, and by the mid-1940s Hitler’s regime had mercilessly slaughtered 6 million Jews and numerous others whom they considered inferior.”","2731","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"He thinks that the Second Amendment protects assault rifles and armor-penetrating ammunition, because the “intent” of the amendment is to protect people’s freedom from government, which means that they “have a right to any type of weapon that they can legally obtain in order to protect themselves.” That’s an extraordinary view, and Carson offers no historical evidence on its behalf.","2732","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"On free speech, Carson thinks that the biggest threat comes from what he calls the “Political Correctness police,” who have “created fear in a large portion of our population, causing them to remain silent.” The result, he says, is akin to “living under a tyrannical government.” Carson is certainly right to object that many people on the left strongly discourage what they see as offensive speech. That’s bad, but it’s not really like living under tyranny.","2733","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"At nearly every point, Carson reads the Constitution as if it mandates, or at least supports, his own policy preferences. But to his credit, he doesn’t demonize anyone, and he never resorts to contempt or ridicule. His preferred strategy is to accommodate those who disagree with him – for example, by defending civil unions while rejecting same-sex marriage, and by suggesting that private charity might do the work of redistribution by government.","2734","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"
"Because of its superficiality, and its occasionally idiosyncratic conclusions, his book cannot be counted as good. But its tone is impressively respectful and fair-minded, and the author’s reverence for the founding document is inspiring. No one could read it without concluding that Carson is a generous and decent man -- and without obtaining a better appreciation of why his message is resonating with a large number of honorable Americans.","2735","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/25/ben-carsons-odd-take-constitution/74481662/"

"While these and other puzzles continue to animate the media, as they should, Carson has indeed revealed himself to be a strategic iconoclast, successfully signaling to the Republican base the following targeted messages: He distrusts government; he was imperfect before faith corrected his course; the media are the enemy of the people; he’s been faithful to his wife.","2760","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/11/parker-dr-ben-carson/75565502/"

"It's one of the best kept secrets in medicine. Many patients don't know about it. About one-third of primary care doctors have never even heard of it. One study has shown it can reduce the risk of contracting HIV by 92%. Yet less than 1% of those who could benefit are actually taking it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What is it. A pill, sold under the brand name Truvada, a prevention option called “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” or PrEP. Why don't more people know about it? Some of it has to do with practical barriers. State AIDS Drug Assistance Programs don't pay for it, and some state Medicaid programs don't either. Marketing is key. In New York, prescriptions for PrEP among people with Medicaid insurance jumped dramatically after the state launched a campaign to tell people about the medication. This bit of PR probably won't hurt either: Charlie Sheen's former girlfriend, Amanda Bruce, said she took PrEP to prevent him from infecting her with HIV.","2858","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/24/evening-news-roundup-tuesday/76305992/"

"Turkey shot down a Russian warplane Tuesday, and it has caused a lot of tension in the global struggle over the future of Syria and the fate of the Islamic State. Explain. Turkey says the Russian aircraft breached its airspace. Putin denies it, and says the plane was in Syria fighting ISIL. Right as the plane went down, France's President Francois Hollande was about to sit down with President Obama at the White House to press Washington and Moscow to join in a united effort to combat the Islamic State in its home base in Syria. But the alliance he's trying to form is dicey. That’s because Russia, Turkey, the United States and France are all involved in Syria's 4-year-old civil war but support different factions, some of which are fighting each other. More on that here. The downing of the warplane by Turkey — a U.S. ally — illustrates how far Hollande is from his goal of bringing Moscow and Washington into his grand alliance.","2862","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/24/evening-news-roundup-tuesday/76305992/"

"""Nobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East,"" said Duane R.

"Clarridge's frustration is certainly understandable. Carson, in a Sunday appearance on Fox News, couldn't name a single country that he'd call on to fight ISIS — but to out the boss as an empty vessel? Wow.

"Before 'Lotagate' happened, Armstrong Williams described Clarridge as ""a mentor for Dr. Carson."" And earlier this week, in the wake of the Fox News fiasco, the campaign felt that Carson could recoup by speedily devising a plan to fight ISIS.

"In the current flap over some things that Dr. Carson said, the biggest discrepancy has been between the furor in the media and the irrelevance of his statements to any political issue.","2941","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/15/ben-carson-flaps/75683964/"
"For example, in a video that someone dug up, Dr. Carson said to an audience that his “theory” about the Pyramids is that they were used as storage facilities. He was smiling as he said this, so it is not clear whether he was using this theory just to illustrate some point. But, in any case, he was not claiming this as a fact.","2942","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/15/ben-carson-flaps/75683964/"

"Yet the media have paid far more attention to Ben Carson’s speculation about what the Pyramids were built for, thousands of years ago, than to outright lies that Hillary Clinton told about tragic American deaths in Benghazi, within days after she knew the truth, as her own e-mails now reveal.","2944","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/15/ben-carson-flaps/75683964/"
"Another media tempest in a teapot has developed because of the mild-mannered Dr. Carson’s recollections about some childhood incidents in which he depicted himself as violent toward another child. Some people who knew the young Ben Carson have said that such behavior would have been out of character for him. But has no one ever acted out of character, especially in childhood?","2945","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/15/ben-carson-flaps/75683964/"
"Albert Einstein, as a child, once threw a heavy object at his little sister that could have injured her or even killed her.

"What has been far more disturbing than anything Ben Carson has said or done has been the media’s search-and-destroy mission against the renowned brain surgeon. The utter irrelevance of the issues raised by the media, at a time when the country faces monumental challenges at home and overseas, makes the media hype grotesque. It tells us more about the media than about Dr. Carson.","2947","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/15/ben-carson-flaps/75683964/"
"By contrast, the media showed no such zeal to expose Barack Obama’s associations and alliances with a whole series of people who expressed their hatred of America in words and/or deeds.

"Nor have the media launched such attacks on President Obama as they have on candidate Carson, even after Obama proceeded to abandon existing American commitments to provide defensive aid to countries in Eastern Europe and to directly promote the destruction of governments in Egypt and Libya that posed no threat to American interests – all the while undermining Israel’s ability to defend itself.","2949","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/15/ben-carson-flaps/75683964/"

"It was much the same story on domestic issues.

"When Carson says he turned down a scholarship, I wonder if he’s perhaps confusing the category of nomination with that of an appointment.

Nice touch for Jesus, there Josh.","2991","http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/11/12/time-defend-starbucks-ben-carson/75577602/"
"Never mind the fact that Starbucks has never carried religious-themed cups, unless Feuerstein counts the Norse mermaid with a twin-tail. Never mind that Starbucks has no company policy that prohibits their employees from saying Merry Christmas. Facts are such a little matter when you get your exercise by jumping to conclusions.","2992","http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/11/12/time-defend-starbucks-ben-carson/75577602/"
"Here’s my bottom line, folks. I don’t get my faith from a coffee cup or a barista wishing me a Merry Christmas. And I certainly won’t depend on salvation from a surgeon who says he’ll stand for the Bible if he’s elected.","2993","http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/11/12/time-defend-starbucks-ben-carson/75577602/"
"But as a person of faith, I will stand up for those who are wrongly accused or harpooned. Left or right, up or down. Wrong is wrong. If I intend to show integrity in my faith, I must not allow anyone to be slandered.","2994","http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/11/12/time-defend-starbucks-ben-carson/75577602/"
"Yes, that means that I’ve occasionally defended the wrong people. I once drafted a column defending Anthony Weiner when he said he never tweeted photos of his southern parts. Gratefully, that rogue column remained unpublished.","2995","http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/11/12/time-defend-starbucks-ben-carson/75577602/"
"Well, you can’t say that you weren’t forewarned. Hopefully, my editors will bring me back to the straight and narrow next time.","2996","http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/11/12/time-defend-starbucks-ben-carson/75577602/"

"DES MOINES, Iowa — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Friday night offered a wide-ranging appeal to evangelicals in this key presidential proving ground, opting for humor, solemnity — and an unambiguous pitch for his viability as the GOP's presidential nominee.","12:24 p.m. EST November 21, 2015","2998","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"""If the body of Christ rises up as one and votes our values, we can turn this country around,"" Cruz said as he drive home his mantra that more Christians need to show up the polls — and he is the candidate to inspire them.","2999","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"In one of the most stirring moments, Cruz recalled one time when he asked God for forgiveness: He was a student in law school and his parents were on the verge of divorce. Citing the sin of pride, Cruz said he thought he could keep his mom and dad together, printing out ""page after page of scripture"" and sending it to them in hopes they would reconsider.","3000","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"“I was convinced somehow I could stop it,"" Cruz said, ""and I think that was hurtful to my parents.""","3001","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"Cruz's parents would eventually go through with the divorce. It's a part of his biography that rarely comes up on the campaign trail — and one that brought silence over a crowd of hundreds listening to him at The Family Leader's Presidential Family Forum.","3002","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"Staged around a Thanksgiving table, the event was billed as a venue for Cruz and six other GOP candidates to bare their souls — not necessarily debate policy and politics — before an estimated crowd of 1,800 Iowa conservatives. It was also one of the last opportunities to publicly woo Family Leader head Bob Vaander Plaats, a kingmaker among evangelical voters who is expected to make an endorsement before Christmas. Vander Plaats is rumored to favor Cruz.","3003","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"The forum got off to a rocky start, with protesters repeatedly interrupting moderator Frank Luntz as he asked the first question of Cruz. In an animated commentary, the senator later tied the heckling to recent examples of political correctness on college campuses across America.","3004","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"""We're seeing universities all across this country with leftist-coddled kids, usually with trust funds, protesting against the horrible oppression because the microaggression — 'I heard a word that scared me,'"" Cruz said. ""What is wrong with our universities?""","3005","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"The line scored with an audience that appeared to have grown frustrated with the frequent interruptions. Cruz drew another strong response when he rehashed his challenge to debate President Barack Obama on Syrian refugee policy. Asked what he would tell Obama if he were in the room, Cruz motioned to the crowd and said, ""Mr. President, this is America.""","3006","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"""President Obama today is serving as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorists,"" Cruz later said, rejecting the idea that Obama is an ""armchair quarterback"" when it comes to foreign policy. ""It's worse than that. The policies he's advancing are helping the other team.""","3007","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"In another shot at the Obama administration's foreign policy, Cruz reiterated his belief that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry ""should resign in disgrace"" for his statement that there as a ""rationale"" for the terrorists attacks earlier this year on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Luntz then asked the candidates to raise their hands if they agree with Cruz; not one immediately did so, but former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee interjected that while it would be nice for Kerry to resign, he would most prefer the president step down.","3008","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"The episode could have legs as Cruz sharpens his differences with his GOP rivals. Cruz aides were quick to note during the forum that Cruz is the only senator running for president who voted against Kerry's confirmation in 2013.","3009","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"By the end of the forum, though, it was clear Cruz's helpings of red meat aimed at Obama were the most popular. The senator most memorably riffed on Obama's notorious comment in 2008 that some Americans ""get bitter"" and ""cling to guns or religion.""","3010","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"""Well, we’re not bitter, but we are getting pretty angry,"" Cruz said. ""And you know what? He can’t have either our God or our guns.""","3011","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"Cruz also did not spare Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, latching on to her remark during a debate earlier this year that she counts Republicans among her ""enemies.""","3012","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"""She doesn’t just mean the people sitting at this stage,"" Cruz said of the former secretary of state. ""She means the people all across this country who terrify her.""","3013","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"
"The forum capped the first day of a two-day swing through Iowa for Cruz, who held town halls earlier Friday in Sioux City and Harlan. At each stop, he was accompanied by Hawkeye State Congressman Steve King, an influential figure in conservative circles who endorsed Cruz on Monday.","3014","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/21/cruz-makes-wide-ranging-pitch-iowa-evangelicals/76167940/"

"This week’s chatter on the Republican Party’s quest for their nominee was mostly about how Ben Carson lied or exaggerated about his attempt to hit his mother over the head with a hammer, throw rocks at a boy with glasses, and actually stab someone with a knife. Stabbing someone is attempted murder, folks. So why is the emphasis on whether or not the story is true, as opposed to what he unapologetically says he did? Why isn’t anyone talking about this? It is frankly absurd and more than a little scary.","12:07 a.m. EST November 12, 2015","3016","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/11/12/keep-losing-nuclear-energy/75600464/"
"I’m sorry, but troubled youth or not, trying to kill someone is exactly that — attempted murder. In addition, if he did attempt to stab someone, and did try to hit his mother over the head with a hammer, why wasn’t he arrested for the assault? Maybe his mother didn’t want to press charges, but what about the kid who was supposedly stabbed? Bizarre is an understatement to describe all of this.","3017","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/11/12/keep-losing-nuclear-energy/75600464/"
"This is worse than the theater of the absurd. The Republican voters see nothing wrong with giving Ben Carson, who by his own admission tried to kill someone, the job of President of the United States.","3018","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/11/12/keep-losing-nuclear-energy/75600464/"
"So any way, you look at it, whether Dr. Ben Carson made it up and is a pathological liar, or he is a someone who tried to kill a person, it is all pretty frightening. These are hardly the qualities I would think anyone would want in our next President.","3019","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/11/12/keep-losing-nuclear-energy/75600464/"
"Additionally, Ben Carson said the boy was saved because his belt buckle prevented the knife from going into his internal organs. So I ask you, what would have happened if Ben Carson had a gun in his hands? Think about it.","3020","http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/11/12/keep-losing-nuclear-energy/75600464/"
