"If U.S. presidents were chosen by book sales, Ben Carson would soon occupy the Oval Office.","Published March 13, 2015","2","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"While potential 2016 contenders are busy traversing the country visiting early primary states and courting donors, some have also found time to promote their recently released tomes. Since 2012, at least eight potential 2016 presidential contenders have released books, with Carson — the former neurosurgeon turned conservative superstar — by far the best selling author among them, according to numbers obtained from Nielsen Bookscan.","3","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"Carson’s ”One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America’s Future” has sold a staggering 355,000 copies since its release in May 2014.","4","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"Its only real competition has been Hillary Clinton’s “Hard Choices,” which has sold 264,000 copies since its release in June 2014. Though Carson’s book advance has not been released, it likely pales in comparison to Clinton’s reported $14 million, the second highest advance in history for a non-fiction book.","5","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"Mike Huckabee comes in third place in the “book sales primary” with his ”God, Guns, Grits and Gravy” selling 53,000 copies since its recent release in January. Scott Walker’s tome “Unintimidated: A Governor’s Story And A Nation’s Challenge” has sold 21,000 copies in hardcover and paperback since its release in Nov. 2013, placing the Wisconsin governor in fourth place.","6","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"In 2012, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul released ”Government Bullies: How Everyday Americans Are Being Harassed, Abused, And Imprisoned By The Feds,” co-authored with his father, former Rep. Ron Paul. It has so far sold 14,000 copies in hardcover and paperback, which is enough to currently garner Paul the fifth place slot.","7","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"Near the bottom of the pack is Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who many consider the current frontrunner — or at least co-frontrunner — for the GOP nomination. His 2013 book “Immigration Wars: Forging An American Solution,” co-authored with Clint Bolick, has so far sold roughly 6,000 books in hardcover and paperback.","8","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"His Florida compatriot, Sen. Marco Rubio, released his latest book ”American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity For Everyone” in January, but so far sales have been mediocre. The book has only sold only 5,000 to date.","9","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"At the very bottom of the book primary is former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, whose 2014 book “Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting To An America That Works” has sold a paltry 4,000 copies.","10","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"So, do book sales actually tell us anything about the 2016 presidential race? Probably not much, according to Larry Sabato, the head of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “It says Carson and Clinton made a lot more money than Bush and Rubio,” Sabato told The Daily Caller. “And Carson has very committed backers that may well give him a higher proportion of the votes than some expect. But the GOP nomination? Highly unlikely.”","11","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"“50,000 spread over a nation means little,” he added. “5 million? Now we’re talking.”","12","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"Nonetheless, the book primary is only going to heat up, with more potential presidential contenders set to release new books soon. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s book “A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Miracle of America” is slated for publication in June, while Rand Paul’s new book “Taking A Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics To Unite America” is set to be released in May. Jeb Bush is reportedly planning to release an e-book in the coming months as well.","13","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"
"All book sales numbers are current up to March 8. Nielsen BookScan’s U.S. Consumer Market Panel “currently covers approximately 85% of the print book market,” according to the company.","14","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/13/ben-carson-leads-book-sales-primary.html"

"PRESSURE GROWS ON HILLARY FROM LEFT AND RIGHT The stakes are getting higher for Hillary Clinton. Liberal outlets and Democratic donors are pressuring her to offer substantive answers to the growing body of evidence against her and her husband and their cash fracking operation. That means she will soon have to meet the press (This time, expect a soft-focus interview with a credible but credulous reporter rather than the horror of her email press conference). While Clinton and her team are rehearsing lines that don’t sound like a deposition but can get past the legal department, a more serious challenge is on the horizon. Katie Couric doesn’t put you under oath. Trey Gowdy does.","118","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/pressure-grows-on-hillary-from-left-and-right.html"
"House Speaker John Boehner said Clinton “violated the law” when she destroyed more than 30,000 emails from her time as secretary of state and that he was open to trying to subpoena her servers. And now, Clinton has been called to testify about her role in the cover-up of the Benghazi attack. She has said in the past that she would cooperate, but recently refused the offer of a closed-door chat. Will she refuse to appear in public? Would she fight a subpoena? The stakes are higher now that allegations of corruption are stacking up. Benghazi leads to questions about her servers and destruction of evidence. The destruction of evidence leads to questions about the new allegations of official misconduct. But does she dare say no?","119","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/pressure-grows-on-hillary-from-left-and-right.html"

Rick Perry, R-Texas, also have favorability in the state. Newbies like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., have put a lot of time in the Iowa, however, and might catch fire among libertarian-leaning Republicans, while unknowns like Carly Fiorina, who spent the past five days in Iowa, might take with voters there too.

And as he does, he sets himself on a collision course with establishment pick Jeb Bush. While Bush is busy Hoovering up cash around the country, Kasich is looking to win a war of ideas. He’s selling an updated version of Bush’s brother’s compassionate conservatism, which means Kasich’s path doesn’t run through winning the conservative melee and being Bush’s eventual foe. Instead, Kasich would have to try to disrupt Bush’s hold on the establishment.

It wasn’t quantifiable.

"The roiling national debate over vaccinations has spilled over into the 2016 presidential race, as potential candidates clash over whether a measles outbreak underscores the need for strict vaccination policies.","Published February 03, 2015","204","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, both potential Republican candidates, waded into the debate on Monday, saying parents should have a say in whether to vaccinate their kids. The remarks were not a departure from previously stated positions, but in light of the current measles outbreak, they drew widespread attention -- and criticism.","205","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting 102 confirmed measles cases spread across 14 states, which follows last year's record outbreak in which 644 cases were diagnosed across 27 states -- the largest outbreak since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000.","206","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"On Tuesday, Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon and conservative advocate who is considering a White House run, weighed in on the other side. While saying there are ""exceptional situations"" that should be heard and he strongly believes in individual rights, Carson said, ""I also recognize that public health and public safety are extremely important in our society.""","207","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"He said in a statement: ""Certain communicable diseases have been largely eradicated by immunization policies in this country and we should not allow those diseases to return by foregoing safe immunization programs, for philosophical, religious or other reasons when we have the means to eradicate them.""","208","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"

"Christie, who spoke Monday after making a tour of a biomedical research lab in Cambridge, England, said that he and his wife had vaccinated their children. However, the governor added, ""I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well. So that's the balance that the government has to decide.""","210","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"

"""I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines,"" Paul, an eye doctor, said in a subsequent interview while suggesting vaccines were ""a good thing."" ''But I think the parents should have some input. The state doesn't own your children.""","212","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"Both men's staffs later sent out statements clarifying their remarks. Christie's spokesman said the governor believed that ""with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated."" The statement from Paul's office pointed out that the senator's children have all been vaccinated and added that Paul ""believes that vaccines have saved lives, and should be administered to children.","213","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"

"On Tuesday, even House Speaker John Boehner weighed in. Asked about the dispute, he said, ""I don't know that we need another law, but I do believe that all children ought to be vaccinated.""","216","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"

"""When you see educated people or elected officials giving credence to things that have been completely debunked, an idea that’s been shown to be responsible for multiple measles and pertussis outbreaks in recent years, it’s very concerning,"" Amesh Adalja, an an infectious-disease physician at the Center for Health Security at the University of Pittsburgh, told The Washington Post.","218","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"GOP operative Rick Wilson told the paper that he thought Christie's remarks could have been a clumsy play to win over conservative voters suspicious of government mandates.","219","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"""There’s only one of two options,"" Wilson said of Christie. ""Either he’s so tone-deaf that he doesn’t understand why saying this is bad for him, or this is a considered political strategy. And that would be even more troubling.""","220","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"In fact, Christie pledged to fight for greater parental involvement in vaccination decisions during his first campaign for New Jersey governor in 2009.","221","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"All states now require children to get certain vaccinations to enroll in school, although California and New Jersey are among 20 states that let parents opt out by obtaining a waiver. Parents in New Jersey seeking such a waiver for medical reasons must submit a written statement from their doctor or registered nurse.","222","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly urges parents to get their children vaccinated against measles and other childhood diseases.

"Concerns about autism and vaccinations are often traced to a 1998 study in the British journal Lancet. While the research was later discredited and retracted by the journal, legions of parents abandoned the vaccine, leading to a resurgence of measles in Western countries where it had been mostly stamped out. Last year, there were more than 4,100 cases in Europe, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.","224","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air, with symptoms that include fever, runny nose and a blotchy rash.

"New Jersey requires the vaccine for children between 12 months and 15 months old, and then a second dose between ages 4 and 6. Such mandated vaccinations are a point of irritation among some conservatives, notable in the early voting state of Iowa, where Christian home-school advocates constitute an influential bloc of voters who take part in the Republican presidential caucuses.","227","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"
"Barb Heki, a leader in Iowa's home-school advocacy network, said such parents ""adhere to the idea that it's the parents' right to make the decision on vaccinations.","228","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"

"Louise Kuo Habakus, a radio host who runs a nonprofit group opposed to state-required vaccinations, said she helped arrange a meeting between parents and Christie on the issue in 2009 and saluted him for standing up for the ""rights of parents to direct the health, welfare and upbringing of their children.""","230","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/03/chris-christie-rand-paul-under-fire-for-vaccine-remarks.html"

"LIBYA DEBACLE CASTS SHADOW ON OBAMA WAR PLAN President Obama had better leave some blank spaces in the next draft of his proposal to Congress for a “right-sized” war to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Key U.S. ally Egypt has now bombed ISIS targets in Libya, which is some 700 miles away from what we were are told is theater of war – a distance about the same as that between Pittsburgh and Savannah. (So at least now you know who not to ask for directions.) In the spirit of baseball spring training, maybe the updated version can just say “Iraq, Syria, Libya and nations to be named later…” But before we get to the issue of Egypt bombing an ISIS affiliate in Libya in reprisal for the beheadings of 21 Egyptian Christians, we might do well to consider how we ended up with an ISIS affiliate in Libya anyway.","237","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/16/libya-debacle-casts-shadow-on-obama-war-plan.html"

"What a difference - Four years ago today, the chatter was also all about Egypt and Libya, but the news was very different. In Egypt, the country was in turmoil in the wake of President Hosni Mubarak’s resignation five days earlier under intense pressure from Obama. But the big news was in Libya, where the rebellion against dictator Muammar Qaddafi had just gotten underway the night before in the city of Benghazi. Within 10 days, both Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would call for regime change in Libya. The U.S. would join the civil war on the side of the rebels about a month later. Eighteen months after that, Islamist militants would attack and destroy a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, the city where the rebellion began. Each passing month would bring worse news from Libya as the Islamists who fought in the rebellion took more control over and eventually suffocated the fledgling Western-backed government.","239","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/16/libya-debacle-casts-shadow-on-obama-war-plan.html"

"Bad call - Things looked to be going in the same direction for a time in Egypt. The “moderate” Islamists who took control after Mubarak’s ouster proved to be not-so-moderate after all. As the largest Arab nation was careening toward disaster, U.S. allies in the region successfully pressured the Obama administration to back a restoration last year of the same kind of government Obama had helped unseat four years ago. Libya today is a nightmare state and Egypt is back under the control of the military. It may sound like madness, but don’t forget how deeply (and as it would turn out, wrongly) the world swooned at the idea of what was then known as the Arab Spring. The Obama administration took an aggressive stance on the unfolding revolutionary movement that has left the region in even deeper chaos. How real are the chances that the president will again be part of a coalition to strike Libya, but this time against some of the same factions he previously supported? Well, the U.S. is now coordinating with the regime in Syria it once threatened to attack, so never say never.","241","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/16/libya-debacle-casts-shadow-on-obama-war-plan.html"
"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... None of our 44 presidents was born on this day. But in deference to ease of scheduling and partly a desire to avoid political offense, today’s federal holiday has been widely known as President’s Day since 1971. It is still technically recorded as George Washington’s Birthday (which is actually Feb. 22), but the popular understanding is that today’s holiday honors all presidents. Any event that celebrates Franklin Peirce and Woodrow Wilson equally to Washington and Abraham Lincoln can truly be said to celebrate nothing. So what’s the point? Why, a day off, of course. And for decades, Americans have used the extra day to go car shopping. Auto sales surge by about 25 percent every President’s Day weekend. But before it was cars, it was bicycles. The Atlantic examines the largely lost, Gilded Age history of how bicycles helped make the holiday into a mercantile moment for the nation. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

And while the next 10 days will bring plenty of drama in the fight to roll back President Obama’s temporary executive amnesty for illegal immigrants, the hardline approach is good news for at least one Republican presidential hopeful: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cruz, who has also continued to add key staff members and build out what might be a formidable fundraising machine, seems to have so far avoided a shooting war with his own party on the issue. That truce has helped the conservative favorite move to his highest ranking yet in the Fox News First 2016 GOP Power Index. And making his debut on the list is Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, another fiscal hawk. He will make his first visit to the early primary state of South Carolina on Wednesday. [And before you tell us why Kasich can’t win, we would offer you this riddle: What’s round on both ends and “hi” in the middle… and is the most important state every presidential election?] [Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins Gretchen Carlson on “The Real Story” in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who’s up and who’s down in the 2016 Power Index.] And here’s this week’s full ranking: 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Scott Walker; 3) Marco Rubio; 4) Ted Cruz [+1]; 5) Rand Paul [-1]; 6) Rick Perry; 7) Ben Carson; 8) Chris Christie; 9) John Kasich [first ranking]; 10) Mike Huckabee [-1].

What’s the plan? WATCH HERE. Wide open spaces - NBC News “[A] trio of new NBC News/Marist polls show that the Republican race is wide open in the early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. In fact, seven different possible Republican candidates get double-digit support in at least one of the states. But only two candidates, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, are in double digits in all three states…In Iowa, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee leads the GOP pack getting support from 17 percent of potential Republican caucus-goers, followed by Bush at 16 percent, Walker at 15 percent, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 9 percent and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., at 7 percent. In New Hampshire, Bush gets support from 18 percent of potential GOP primary voters, followed by Walker at 15 percent, Paul at 14 percent and Christie at 13 percent. And in South Carolina, it's native son Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., at 17 percent, Bush at 15 percent, Walker at 12 percent, and Huckabee and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson tied at 10 percent.” Minus Mitt, Nevada caucuses up for grabs - Real Clear Politics “…Though it is far too early to put much weight into such surveys, a poll conducted by the group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions found a wide-open race among likely GOP caucus-goers with Scott Walker [18 percent], Jeb Bush [12 percent] and Rand Paul [9 percent] constituting the top three.” Perry pumping up Iowa presence - Des Moines Register: “Republican Rick Perry continues to build steam for a likely presidential bid, booking a return trip to Iowa and hiring Iowa political operatives. The former Texas governor will be in the Sioux City area Monday for a full day of private meetings and a 5 p.m. town hall at Morningside College’s Lincoln Center. Perry’s political action committee, RickPAC, has hired four Iowans: [Perry’s 2012 Iowa Co-Chairman] Robert Haus, [former Gov.

Chris Christie [R-N.J.] is scheduled to give remarks at the Concord City Republican Committee Lincoln-Reagan Dinner tonight in New Hampshire. Rand takes page from Hillary playbook - The Hill notes that 2016 GOP contender Sen. Rand Paul is employing a favorite Hillary Clinton tactic – working across the aisle – ahead of a potential presidential bid. “This week, Paul introduced legislation with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid [D-Nev.] to restore federal voting rights to non-violent offenders who have been released from prison. Last week, he unveiled a bill with Sen. Patrick Leahy [Vt.], the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, to give federal judges more discretion to hand out sentences below the requirements of mandatory minimums…In her time in the Senate, Hillary Clinton sponsored an array of bipartisan bills, with an eye on fashioning a pragmatic image after years of being seen as a hyper-partisan figure…And such efforts are not wholly confined to the past for Clinton, who is preparing for another likely White House run in 2016.”","242","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/16/libya-debacle-casts-shadow-on-obama-war-plan.html"

Scott Walker] shortly after he took office in January 2011, was supposed to help the state climb out of recession by shedding bureaucratic rules and drawing on private-sector expertise. But the WEDC has fallen short of its own goals by tens of thousands of jobs and failed to keep track of millions of dollars it has handed out…Critics say the WEDC’s struggles highlight a significant gap in Walker's resume as he lays the groundwork for a likely Republican presidential bid in the 2016 election: his middling record on job creation…Walker's office dismisses such criticism, saying the WEDC, which he chairs, is one part of a comprehensive strategy that includes tax cuts, streamlined regulations, worker training and targeted investments in areas like energy and shipbuilding.” THE CAMPAIGN WITHOUT A CANDIDATE ROLLS ON KCRG: “MoveOn and Democracy for America members in Hiawatha Monday to open the local Run Warren Run office to show the broad, grass roots support for Sen.

AP reports that officials are set to announce that the new measurements put the Washington Monument at 554 feet, 7 and eleven-thirty-seconds of an inch, nearly 10 inches shorter that the historical recognized height of 555 feet, 5 and 1/8 inches. The National Geodetic Survey scientists are tasked with the measurement say it is simply a case of improved measurement standards which starts at the lowest open-air pedestrian entrance. Chief Geodesist, Dru Smith said, “The building didn’t change height because of anything; it is just where you start from.” Lt. Col. Thomas Casey took the original dimensions in 1884 using four brass markers at the base with the only noticeable height change occurring at the tip which had been rounded over time thanks to frequent lightning strikes. Have no fear, the National Park Service doesn’t plan to change the historical number, “For our purposes we’ll still use the historic height rather than the architectural height, since they’re measured from different places,” said spokeswoman Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles.

"HILLARY’S EMAIL SCANDAL INTENSIFIES STORM Consider this: When Hillary Clinton made the choice to dodge the rules and exclusively use a private email account for official business as secretary of state, she knew that today would come. But she must have determined that the bad press she would get for being secretive and unaccountable would be worth the advantages of secrecy and control. This is different than her ongoing fundraising controversies. Clinton’s defenders can argue that the presumptive Democratic nominee’s decision to allow her family foundation to take contributions from undesirable foreign governments was the result of Clinton caring too deeply about the sick and impoverished and lacking a foresight about the public backlash. This is very different. The WaPo reports that Clinton apparently made the decision to skirt federal requirements even before her Senate confirmation hearings for the post began. Knowing the turmoil this would cause, Clinton necessarily assumed that the scandal would be worth being able to hide her electronic tracks. [Politico seeks to explain the series of stumbles by Team Hillary in recent weeks by citing a lack of adequate staffing. Along the way, the piece sheds some light on the warring factions inside the $2 billion enterprise that continues to pit President Obama’s team against Clinton’s core.]","247","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/03/hillarys-email-scandal-intensifies-storm.html"
"Bad timing - What Clinton could not have foreseen is that the revelation would come at the most damaging moment imaginable. The news comes not only as outrage simmers over her foundation’s sketchy practices but also as Clinton returns to Washington and the political sphere tonight to rally her supporters at EMILY’S List, the pro-choice group that is tasked with waging war on Clinton’s potential opponents on gender issues. The bombshell about secret emails at the State Department also hits on the day the foreign policy she helped craft faces intense scrutiny with the arrival of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a last-ditch bid to head off a nuclear deal with Iran. Her public presence on the same day as Netanyahu’s speech was tough enough. A public appearance on the day of the most significant scandal yet surrounding her second presidential run is just a disaster. [Daily Caller reports that the Department of Justice shut down attempts to search off-site storage facilities for Lois Lerner’s missing emails claiming that opponents shouldn’t have even known these facilities and tapes even existed.] Cui bono? - Clinton’s team is adamant that their candidate complied with the intent of the law that required the former secretary to conduct business on her government account. Their argument is that by providing copies of the emails to other officials that the government already has Clinton is in the clear. Then why the private account? And what was left out of the document dump the Clinton campaign unloaded on the government? Are there emails about the debacle in Libya? Are there emails to unsavory individuals or groups? And the questions will go on and on. An audacious, premeditated decision to skirt sunlight laws and accountability measures is hardly the thing that Clinton needs at a moment when doubts about her ethics were already mounting. JEB LOOKS TO EASE CONSERVATIVE WORRIES Las Vegas Review-Journal: “Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday told a crowd of about 400 people in Las Vegas that he applies conservative values, not just talks about them, as he seriously considers a run for president in 2016. Bush said he’s done something ‘that is kind of unusual in Washington world,’ He’s had the chance to sign the front side of a paycheck and experience how businesses are formed, how jobs are created and how risk-takers, looking to create businesses, are important for the economy. He also talked about his accomplishments in Florida during eight years as governor…” Jeb mum on donor meetings - AP: “Bush was scheduled to be in Las Vegas through Tuesday afternoon. His team acknowledged he had other private meetings while in Las Vegas - including some focused on raising money - but declined to provide further details. The city is home to several prominent Republican donors, including Las Vegas Sands Corp. CEO Sheldon Adelson, who was in Washington on Monday to attend a speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Bush said he monitored Netanyahu’s speech, which Bush described as ‘classy.’” [WaPo: “Former Vice President Dan Quayle is set to co-host a fundraiser in Arizona [today] for a super PAC backing Jeb Bush, one of a series of high-dollar events that the former Florida governor is headlining as he mulls a possible presidential bid.] Prepares to press the flesh in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Bush, a former Florida governor, will mingle with Iowans at a barbecue restaurant in Waukee and a pizza restaurant in Cedar Rapids, as well as at a fundraiser in Urbandale and a big multi-contender political event in Des Moines, as previously reported…Bush has now scheduled two more events: He will meet privately with Iowa activists, volunteers and GOP campaign veterans on Saturday afternoon at Jethro’s BBQ 'n Jambalaya in Waukee. On Saturday night, he’ll do a public meet-and-greet at the Pizza Ranch at 2450 Westdale Drive SW in Cedar Rapids.” IS WALKER PEAKING TOO SOON? Noting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s surge in popularity as well as his trip-ups, goateed eminence Jonah Goldberg questions whether the potential 2016 GOP contender’s timing is off: “In countless discussions I had at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference – as well as among people I’ve talked to who attended the Club for Growth meeting in Florida this weekend — the concern for friends, and the hope for foes, is that Walker is peaking too soon.” Rand looks to blunt critics on Israel - Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is out with a new video today that includes some tough talk on national defense and his opposition to foreign aid for hostile governments. It is part of an effort to rebut critical coverage of his foreign policy like this piece from Buzzfeed: “‘If you have to give money to Israel, I’m all for people donating and giving money to Israel but we don’t have money for any of those subsidies, it’s gone,’ Paul told blogger Mica Sims in 2010. ‘We have to borrow money from China to give it to other countries. It makes no sense whatsoever from a fiscal standpoint.’” Cruz auditions for Adelson with tough talk on Iran - National Journal: “The meeting room on Capitol Hill was packed, but for Ted Cruz’s presidential ambitions, one person stood out. At a panel discussion sponsored by pro-Israel group This World: The Values Network on Monday afternoon, the Texas senator aggressively voiced his view that Iran should not gain nuclear capabilities. It was an opportunity for Cruz, an almost-certain presidential contender, to make his case to casino magnate, GOP mega-donor and audience member Sheldon Adelson, whose fundraising decisions are heavily influenced by candidates’ support for the security of Israel, for 2016 support.” Kasich on hand for Bibi talk - Columbus Dispatch: “Gov. John Kasich, who this month was in the key presidential primary state of South Carolina, will attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial speech [today] before a joint session of Congress.” Lindsey raises cash on Bibi speech - WaPo: “If you’re not a member of Congress who plans to be there in person, the place to be is the Capitol Hill Club, a GOP social club where Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is holding a speech-watching luncheon that doubles as a fundraiser for his new political committee. ” Perry finds a PAC man - NYT: “Rick Perry … is moving to establish a “super PAC” to back his effort, and has turned to Austin Barbour, a Mississippi-based lobbyist and political operative to head it, according to three people with knowledge of the moves..” Carson makes it official - WSJ: “Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has formally created an exploratory committee to run for president, his campaign chief executive, Terry Giles, said Monday. …With the exploratory committee, Mr. Carson can raise money that he can transfer to his campaign once it begins.” SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX “If the party cannot get together quickly behind one candidate it will be another long eight years with Hillary and Bill to stomach. Scott Walker is the closest to fitting the bill with either [Marco Rubio] or [Carly Fiorina] as the VP running mate.” --Bill Norwood, Ozark, Mo. “I was a [Chris Christie] fan, but have lost interest. Not one of the other candidates, including Jeb, is acerbic enough to duke it out with Hillary’s smarmy cadre of millennial ‘talking pointers.’ Rand Paul has the venom, but he cannot win. Count me as thumbs up to [Gov. Scott Walker] and [Carly Fiorina]!!” --Brooke Samuelson, Windsor, Conn. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... This day in 1845 marks the first time Congress used the Constitutional provision allowing Congressional veto overrides. It was an attempt to rein in President John Tyler’s eager use of presidential veto power. Two weeks prior, Tyler had vetoed a bill that would have denied him the ability to provide funds for cutter ships without Congressional approval. Congress insisted on legislative approval before the commissioning of any new military craft. Tyler’s use of the veto, at 10 times, was only second only to President Andrew Jackson who used it 12 times during his administration. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 45 percent//Disapprove – 50.4 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 32.2 percent//Wrong Track – 59.2 percent SHIFT IN CHRISTIAN VOTERS HELPS EXPLAIN DEMS’ BIBI SNUB There was a time that the idea of nearly 60 Democrats boycotting a speech to Congress by the prime minister of Israel would have been unimaginable. Democrats were the staunchest supporters of the creation and defense of the Jewish state. Republicans were once lukewarm. Now, Democrats increasingly side against Israel, while Republicans are nearly unanimous in support. So how did we get here? Part of it is pique. Some of the speech snubbers are Obama loyalists angry at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’sattempt to scuttle President Obama’s pending nuclear deal with Iran. And as John Judis observed, part of it is rooted in political shifts in Israel and the U.S. and resultant changes in lobbying efforts and gamesmanship on both sides. But that still doesn’t fully explain why so many Democrats would risk a backlash from Jewish voters and supporters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic. The answer lies not with the politics of Jewish Americans, but those of Christians. [WaPo: “In November 1945, [President Harry Truman] offered this riposte to American diplomats cautioning him against embracing the cause of Zionism: ‘I’m sorry, gentlemen, but I have to answer to hundreds of thousands who are anxious for the success of Zionism: I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs among my constituents.’”] Sort it out - As Christians have migrated in increasing numbers to the Republican Party and non-believers have aligned themselves mostly with Democrats, the political pressure points have changed. Social issues, particularly Democratic support for access to elective abortions, have been a major part of this sorting. And like other trends in partisanship, it has been self-perpetuating and self-intensifying. As Christians became more Republican, the Republican Party increasingly reflected their values. Those values, especially among the growing number of evangelical Protestants, include a belief that their faith is an outgrowth of Judaism and in the promise of a land set apart for the people to whom their God first chose to reveal himself. As Democrats become less Christian and Republicans become more Christian, expect the partisan prism on Israel so astonishingly displayed today to become commonplace. [In the latest Gallup poll, 45 percent of Americans view the Israeli leader favorably, up 10 points since 2012 and tying the highest rating recorded by Gallup over Netanyahu’s tenures.] “America’s bond with Israel is stronger than the politics of the moment…This is an important message at an important time and the Prime Minister is the perfect person to deliver it.” –Speaker John Boehner says in a new video previewing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress. Bulldog - WashEx: “…Boehner …. said he will give Israel's leader a bust of [Winston Churchill] to note that only those two foreign leaders have ever addressed Congress three times.” [The Boston Globe reports that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will be among those giving Netanyahu the cold shoulder.] HOUSE MAY VOTE ON DEMS’ HOMELAND BILL TODAY National Journal: “House GOP leaders plan to allow a vote as early as [today] on a clean bill to fund the Homeland Security Department through the rest of the fiscal year, according to Republican sources, dashing the hopes of conservatives who want to tie the money to language clocking President Obama’s executive actions on immigration. Leaders detailed their plan at a closed-door GOP conference meeting [this morning]…According to a source in the room, Speaker John Boehner told members the House would vote on the Senate’s DHS funding bill once it receives papers confirming that the other chamber would not go to conference on the bill…. ‘[T]he House has done its job by passing legislation to fund DHS and block the president’s executive actions on immigration,’ Boehner said, according to the source. ‘Unfortunately, the fight was never won in the other chamber.” “I am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president. … I believe this decision – considering where we are – is the right one for this team, and the right one for this country. The good news is that the president’s executive action has been stopped, for now. This matter will continue to be litigated in the courts, where we have our best chance of winning this fight.” –Speaker John Boehner at a House GOP conference this morning. RYAN & CO. LOOK TO REASSURE JUSTICES ON OBAMACARE Paul Ryan, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, along with Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. and Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., add another layer to the GOP plan to cover ObamaCare beneficiaries if Supreme Court justices opt to blow up the law. The budget hawks proposal comes in a WSJ op-ed and meshes with other proposals floated by Senate Republicans in recent days. [Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream previews the ObamaCare Supreme Court arguments set for Wednesday and the media campaign around Chief Justice John Roberts.] CROSSROADS KEEPS HITTING HASSAN NHjournal: “Following up its radio ad buy announced last week, the conservative issues group Crossroads GPS [today] will launch a $50,000 digital ad buy again criticizing Gov. Maggie Hassan [D-N.H.,] for a proposed budget it says includes ‘more spending, higher taxes, and no real innovation.’ Crossroads last week became the second out-of-state group to attack Hassan, who is viewed as a possible contender for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Kelly Ayotte, [R-N.H.]…. The new digital ad will be seen on Facebook, Twitter and search engine web sites, Crossroads said. Its script is similar to the radio ad, charging Hassan proposed a tax that ‘would hit lower income people hardest’ and ‘sizeable increases in business taxes.’” #JOBHUNT From Politico’s interview with departing White House communications boss Dan Pfeiffer: “[O]ne of the coolest things out there right now ... is what Snapchat is doing with ESPN, CNN, Vice and some others through their Discover function.” HEAVY DUTY ROBBERY From the bizarre crime files, WFTX reports that the Collier County Sheriff’s department is trying to solve a hefty theft in Monterey, a gated community in North Naples, Fla. The thief somehow made off with 183 boxes filled with rolled nickels worth over $18,000 from a house party on February 15. At almost a half-pound per $2 roll, that would be nearly two tons of 5-cent pieces. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “Nobody is asking for America to go to war. What the Israelis are asking, what a lot of Americans are asking – including the majority of Republicans – is real sanctions and to give the Israelis the green light to defend themselves.

"WATCH IT, MARTY: TEAM HILLARY SAID TO PUT O’MALLEY ON NOTICE Byron York reports that the Clinton campaign has put long-shot Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley on notice: “Recently, a representative from the Hillary Clinton camp delivered a message to Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor preparing to challenge Clinton for the 2016 Democratic nomination. I have some good news and some bad news, the messenger said…The good news is we’re taking you seriously, the messenger answered. And the bad news is…we’re taking you seriously. The undertone of threat was unmistakable, but anyone who takes on Clintonworld has to expect that…‘They are the most petty, vengeful people out there,’ says one Democrat of the Clinton organization. ‘They hold a grudge for decades. I don't think he [O’Malley] expected them to welcome him with a fruit basket.’” Partisan divide on email scandal - Fox News polling maestra Dana Blanton writes: “Voters have mixed views over whether Clinton did something wrong by using a personal email account and server instead of the government’s email system. Nearly half think she broke the law (28 percent) or did something unethical (19 percent). The other half feel Clinton just used bad judgment (32 percent) or didn’t do anything wrong (19 percent). … Overall, only 11 percent of voters think Clinton should be the one to decide which emails should be turned over to the government. Most people say an independent mediator should decide (34 percent) or she should be required to turn over all the emails (51 percent).” Do they have servers? - Team Clinton is inching closer to launching an official campaign as staffers for the sanctioned super PAC, Ready for Hillary, are ready to move on to campaign positions and all remaining merchandise from the organization is being heavily discounted. POWER PLAY: SIXTEENERS STRUGGLE WITH FAITH, FREEDOM Amid recent controversy over an Indiana religious freedom law, The Weekly Standard’s Michael Warren and Washington Free Beacon eminence Matthew Continetti join Chris Stirewalt to discuss how religious liberty and other social issues will shape the Republican 2016 presidential field. WATCH HERE. [In the latest Fox News poll, Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., leads among Republican voters with 15 percent while former Gov. Jeb Bush sits in second at 12 percent. Knotted close behind are Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio.] Walker: ‘I just think this is people who are chronically looking for ways to be upset about things’ - Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: “Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker told a conservative crowd this week that people around the country protesting Indiana's religious freedom law are ‘looking for ways to be upset about things.’…Walker, who is ramping up a run for the presidency, dismissed the controversy Wednesday night as part of ‘Insight 2015,’ a live taping of Charlie Sykes' WTMJ-AM (620) program. ‘I just think this is people who are chronically looking for ways to be upset about things instead of really looking at what it is,’ Walker said. Blaming the national media for creating ‘hype and hysteria’ over the Indiana law, Walker noted Wisconsin's constitution has long included a provision for religious freedom. Indiana's law is similar to a federal statute and ones approved by other states, Walker said.” Cruz ads target faithful on Easter - AP: “Republican Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign is buying television advertising time on Easter Sunday in several early voting states, a Democrat who tracks television spending said Thursday. Cruz has reserved ad time during NBC’s ‘A.D.: The Bible Continues’ that will reach most voters in Iowa and South Carolina, as well as Nevada’s most populous media market. The advertising plan skips New Hampshire, the most secular state among the first four states that weigh in on presidential nominees…The ad buy is the latest clear signal that Cruz plans a strong courtship for Christian voters, who have great sway in picking Republicans’ presidential nominee. Two Cruz spokespeople declined to comment about the advertising…It was not immediately clear whether that was the message Cruz would promote in his Easter Sunday ads.” [Cruz hits South Carolina for a two day swing beginning today.] Huck-a-PAC - Fox News: “Mike Huckabee supporters have launched a super PAC, which could boost the former Republican Arkansas governor should he decide to run for president a second time. The PAC, called Pursuing America's Greatness, would be able to raise uncapped funds to support the 2008 Iowa caucuses winner as he tests the presidential waters, including by paying for some of his travel and PAC staff… Pursuing America’s Greatness PAC will be run by Iowan Nick Ryan, a GOP operative who is based in Iowa and who previously supported former Pennsylvania Sen.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., if Graham opts to make his White House run official. The answer could be a boon to Graham not only in his home state’s 2016 primary but also in New Hampshire. McCain heaped praise on his traveling buddy and fellow national security hawk during a forum on counterterrorism and national security in Denver that was moderated by Fox News’ Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry. McCain, who fought a brief duel with George W. Bush in the 2000 election, expressed concern about another president named Bush, “I am not sure whether the Republicans who are voting in the primary want another Bush…the onus will be on [Jeb Bush] that he has to convince people to have another Bush.” [Graham has added two South Carolina campaign veterans to his Security through Strength PAC, Shell Suber as state political director and Caroline O’Neal as state finance director.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... For most of the world’s 2.2 billion Christians, Judas Iscariot is having his annual moment in the spotlight – and it’s not exactly a star turn. Judas, the apostle whom Christians believe betrayed Jesus to religious elders out of a mixture of greed and resentment, is one of the arch villains of human history. Even after two millennia, the name Judas is synonymous with treachery, as is the kiss he sought to give Jesus to identify him to the arresting authorities. Even the traitor’s price, ‘30 pieces of silver’ (a sum roughly equal to four month’s wages for a skilled worker) is widely recalled. But a new book from Peter Stanford asks Christians and non-believers alike to look anew at Judas. It chronicles the hatreds, often anti-Semitic in nature, that were cultivated around Judas and contrasts the subsequent mythology with the historical and Biblical record. When it was uncomfortable for Christians to think of their God going willingly, even meekly, to death, Judas made a convenient scapegoat. While Stanford finds much fault in Christendom, he settles on the cornerstone of the faith: Forgiveness. Stanford writes: ‘In Matthew, straight after the Judas kiss, Jesus tells his betrayer: ‘My friend, do what you are here for’ (26:50). And in John’s account of the Last Supper, once Jesus has identified Judas as the one who will betray him, he tells him: ‘What you are going to do, do quickly’(13:28). Contrary to two millennia of remorseless official vilification and scapegoating, these two brief remarks surely indicate that Jesus knew all too well that Judas was playing his anointed role in God’s plan. It was not a task to win him fans, or a halo, but equally is hardly sufficient to tar him ever after as ‘the most hated name in human history’.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

As the president now embarks on a hard sell to lawmakers and anxious allies, members of his own party expressed wariness of a bargain the Washington Post says falls “Far Short” of Obama’s own goals. Guarded support came from key Senate Democrats like Minority Leader Harry Reid and Maryland’s Ben Cardin, top Democrat on a Senate panel pushing for Congressional approval of an agreement on Iran nukes. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wrapped her praise of the deal as “an important step” in a politically protective “devil is always in the details” blanket. Most Republicans weren’t as circumspect, blasting the framework agreement and renewing demands for Congress to have its say.

"Scott Walker - Walker’s Our American Revival PAC posted a statement saying the president is walking away from his own red lines. “By leaving Iran as a nuclear threshold state, President Obama’s deal with the Supreme Leader risks provoking a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world, one that threatens the survival of our closest regional ally Israel and our key Arab partners.” Ted Cruz - Speaking to a crowd in Des Moines Thursday, Cruz called it a bad deal with a regime that can’t be trusted. “Everything that’s been released so far suggests that this deal will dramatically undermine the national security of the United States” Marco Rubio - In a statement, the defense hawk called the deal failed diplomacy: “I fear it will have devastating consequences for nuclear non-proliferation, the security of our allies and partners, and for U.S. interests in the region” Carly Fiorina - In an op-ed for Fox News Opinion written with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Fiorina says the deal poses a grave threat to American security at home and abroad. Rick Perry – Perry responded via Twitter: “Americans and our allies are right to be wary of a nuclear deal w/ Iran that is riddled with concessions by the Obama Administration.” Mike Huckabee - In a statement to Breitbart: “We should be tightening our grip with the current sanctions not abdicating to the Ayatollah’s interests.” Rick Santorum - From an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt “[Y]ou scratch your head and you wonder what the President is thinking when he believes someone who has never kept a deal, who has always had secret facilities that have not, the world has not known about, that somehow or another they’re going to transform itself because Barack Obama is the one negotiating across the table from them.” Ben Carson - In a statement to Bloomberg: “Over the past few months of negotiations, it is the Iranian side which has achieved the most after all of the talks. Only a framework for a future potential deal has been achieved, while the Iranians have simultaneously increased their capability to enrich uranium.” No word - At publication time, there are no reports of reaction to the Iran deal from Rand Paul, Chris Christie or John Kasich.

WTAE reports that police in Somerset County near Pittsburgh had their hands full with an unwelcome patron at the Burger King on Route 30 near Boswell. JJ Nichols, a Burger King employee, said, “I came around the corner around 5 a.m. behind us. I saw a black pig just sitting behind our door. I wasn’t sure what it was. I was kind of scared.” The menacing pig wandered over from a nearby farm, “We definitely do [see animals]. But I’ve never seen a pig,” Nichols said. The pig left his mark with snout prints left behind on the glass door to the restaurant. The pig was eventually reunited with his owner but not before biting a female customer who refused treatment. AND NOW, A WORLD FROM CHARLES… “Iran is promised a total lifting of sanctions. That’s UN, EU, United States, everywhere…they get their economy back and that’s all they really wanted, but the second, the most astonishing thing is that in return they are not closing a single nuclear facility. Their entire nuclear infrastructure is intact.” —Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here. Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"2016 GOP POWER INDEX: CRUZ CRACKS TOP TIER It’s not that Ted Cruz surprised anyone with his presidential announcement. But where and how he is going about it means that all those on the right looking to be the main rival to conservative frontrunner Scott Walker got a rough wakeup call today. Cruz, with enormous name identification and a network built during his siege war with the Republican congressional leadership, is starting out with an unsparingly conservative message and doing so at the nation’s largest Christian college, Liberty University. Cruz’s early and unflinching entrance is seriously bad news for those hoping to ride enthusiasm from one part of the right – social conservatives, constitutional fundamentalists, firearm-rights enthusiasts, etc. While others are looking to build a movement to knock off Walker and win the chance to face establishment pick Jeb Bush in the GOP finals, Cruz already built his movement. [Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins “The Real Story” in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who’s up and who’s down in the 2016 Power Index.] While Sen. Rand Paul, Ben Carson, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Sen. Rick Santorum and Gov. Bobby Jindal won’t see their core support vanish overnight, they will have increasing difficulty getting past Cruz and his message of “courageous conservatism.” He has all the scars to show for his battles with GOP moderates. His name, in fact, has become shorthand for the kind of Republicanism found odious by many in the Acela Corridor. Being the man most hated by the Republican establishment will go a long, long way with voters who hate the establishment. The question is whether Cruz can solidify his expected role quickly enough to turn his attacks on Walker. For Cruz to make it into the final showdown with Bush, he will need to reserve all his energies for toppling Walker and not spend too much time dickering with other right-wing candidates over doctrinal purity. [Watch Fox: Campaign Carl Cameron is reporting live from Lynchburg, Va., on Sen. Ted Cruz’s [R-Texas] presidential announcement.] If Cruz is indeed to become Walker’s chief tormenter, the biggest beneficiary would have to be Bush. The former Florida governor doesn’t need to worry about answering charges from Cruz (yet, anyway) and if Walker is pushed to express even more stringently conservative positions, Bush would have an easier time of branding him a general election liability. For the establishment frontrunner, the rule remains the same: The more fighting on the right, the better. And the fire that Cruz is lighting today will burn for some time to come. The rankings - 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Scott Walker; 3) Ted Cruz [+1]; 4) Marco Rubio [-1]; 5) Rand Paul [-1]; 6) Carly Fiorina [+1]; 7) Rick Perry [-1]; 8) John Kasich; 9) Chris Christie; 10) Ben Carson.

Send your thoughts toFOXNEWSFIRST@FOXNEWS.COM Jeb-ernaut: Establishment favorite looks to lock down home turf - NYT: “The political apparatus surrounding former Gov. Jeb Bush, determined to avoid embarrassment in a state that has vexed his party and family in national elections, is plotting a vast operation aimed at turning Florida into a bulwark for his presidential campaign, according to dozens of interviews. The plan, code-named ‘Homeland Security,’ seeks to try to neutralize two potentially grave but homegrown threats to Mr. Bush’s long-anticipated run for president: the likely challenge from a charismatic young Republican senator from Miami, Marco Rubio, who is expected to seek the Republican nomination himself, and a demographic drift within Florida that could doom Mr. Bush there in a fall campaign against a Democrat…In what advisers said could amount to a $50 million undertaking by Election Day…” [The Washington Free Beacon reports that Bush adviser James Baker is under fire for his scheduled address at tonight’s J Street conference, a lobbying group that advocates additional pressure on Israel. As a former secretary of state and long-time critic of America’s relationship with Israel, Baker’s address has created criticism among Israeli supporters who previously called on Bush to distance himself from the conference.] Walker scores in South Carolina - WaPo: “COLUMBIA, S.C. – When Jim Ulmer came to see Scott Walker here last week, he was transfixed. ‘He’s the little engine that could,’ Ulmer said, describing the Wisconsin governor who successfully battled labor unions and has rocketed to the front of the Republican presidential race… They acknowledged they know very little about Walker yet said they are ready to vote him into the White House. As they see it, he’s a fighter, tenacious and decisive. He fought the unions again and again, and he won each time. They see the 47-year-old governor as a truth-teller, a pure conservative and an energetic, fresh face, as the future…They want to rally behind someone they can relate to, and, importantly, who they think can take the fight to Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic heavyweight, and win.

Addressing a harbor-side reception Saturday at an exclusive retreat for donors to the Republican National Committee, the Garden State governor appeared to criticize Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, without mentioning him by name, for adjusting his positions to curry favor with early state voters. ‘We need to make sure that we make our party bigger and broader than it’s been before,’ Christie told a sunset gathering of about 250 donors who have given more than $15,000, and as much as $330,000, to the GOP. ‘And that’s not about pandering, it’s not about flip-flopping on issues’…” Carly Fiorina is in Texas today for a speech and some politicking. At a meeting organized by her political action committee, Fiorina said she wasn’t running to be vice president but would be in the race to win it.

What if you kept some sense of yourself and the work you loved doing, but carried no baggage from the past? What if you weren’t haunted by what was gone? The New Yorker tells the story of renowned illustrator Lonni Sue Johnson, who lost most of her memories and much of her ability to make new ones after an infection ravaged her brain seven years ago. “Her ‘temporal window’—the period of time that she can reliably keep track of—slams shut after only a minute or two.” But what Johnson can do is draw and draw and draw. She mostly seems to be content to remain lost in the presentness of her life today.

Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 44.8 percent//Disapprove – 51.4 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 31.4 percent//Wrong Track – 59.8 percent HILLARY, AIDES USED PRIVATE EMAIL FOR BENGHAZI TALK Senior government officials described some of Hillary Clinton’s emails surrounding the 2012 Benghazi, Libya attack for the NYT: “They provided no evidence that Mrs. Clinton, as the most incendiary Republican attacks have suggested, issued a ‘stand down’ order to halt American forces responding to the violence in Benghazi, or took part in a broad cover-up of the administration’s response, according to senior American officials. But they did show that Mrs. Clinton’s top aides at times corresponded with her about State Department matters from their personal email accounts, raising questions about her recent assertions that she made it her practice to email aides at their government addresses so the messages would be preserved, in compliance with federal record-keeping regulations.” Hillary’s brother tapped family connection for Haitian gold mine - WaPo detailed another potential complication for Hillary: her brother Tony Rodham’s involvement in a Haitian gold mine embroiled in controversy over potential environmental damage and the belief that the project will primarily benefit foreign investors…. Rodham and the chief executive of Delaware-based VCS Mining said they were introduced at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative — an offshoot of the Clinton Foundation that critics have long alleged invites a blurring of its charitable mission with the business interests of Bill and Hillary Clinton and their corporate donors.” Democrats still seeking fake primary - As Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton gets ready to officially enter the race with another speech to supporters today, her party has become increasingly concerned that she will emerge from a symbolic primary process unready, ideologically unmoored and without having her wounds properly cauterized. So what to do? Create the illusion of a real contest – as long as a resulting Hillary victory is ensured. “’[W]e're going to have a very robust primary,’ [N.H.] state Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley told the Union-Leader. ‘It's going to happen. (A challenger to Clinton) will emerge.’” The Boston Globe, which backed Hillary rival Barack Obama in 2008, is out pushing Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: “Democrats would be making a big mistake if they let Hillary Clinton coast to the presidential nomination without real opposition…,” the paper claims. But like the Al Gore balloon that was floated in recent weeks, the point is for someone not to win, but to spend tens of millions of dollars to tune Clinton up for the real race and force her to run as an explicit liberal. [Clinton will deliver the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting today in Washington.] O’Malley sets his sights on Iowa - Des Moines Register: “If he’s really serious about the White House, where has Democrat Martin O'Malley been?...O'Malley, a 52-year-old Democrat who served as governor of Maryland, cultivated Iowa activists with vigor before the fall elections, then disappeared. He didn’t resurface until this past weekend…Asked if Iowa Democrats can expect to see him here frequently in the approximately 315 days until the first-in-the-nation presidential vote, O'Malley hedged a bit. ‘I think that any serious presidential campaign has to present its candidacy and its ideas for governing to the people of Iowa,’ he told the Register. ‘If I were in this race, that's certainly what I would do.’” [O’Malley sang folk songs for potential supporters in Council Bluffs.] 2016 Democratic Power Index - 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Joe Biden; 3) Elizabeth Warren [+1]; 4) Martin O’Malley [-1]; 5) Jim Webb POWER PLAY: GRASSLEY SLAMS DEMS ON RACISM CLAIMS Sen.

Grassley joins Chris Stirewalt to discuss that and what the effort to bring a budget plan across the finish line means for ObamaCare and other issues. WATCH HERE. Ex-Im Bank battle heats up - Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a nonpartisan group championing the benefits of free markets and society is launching a campaign against cronyism and the Export-Import Bank today. In their first web titled “A Bad Deal,” Freedom Partners president Marc Short says, “The Ex-Im Bank puts billions of taxpayer dollars at risk to subsidize some of the world’s largest, most well-connected companies at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers. Congress should take a stand against corporate welfare and allow this bank to expire.” Opposition has gained momentum with 2016 Republican presidential contenders including Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush have all come out against reauthorization. Budget battle dominates - The Hill: “Republicans in the House and Senate will both focus on passing their respective budget plans this week in what’s expected to be a long and protracted debate…. It’s unclear if House Republicans keep both fiscal and defense hawks on board. No Democrats are expected to vote for the budget resolution, meaning that Republicans will have to pass it on their own….A final House vote on the budget, which would balance in nine years, is likely Wednesday or Thursday. The Senate, meanwhile, is expected to conduct a ""vote-a-rama,"" during which senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments to the budget. The back-to-back votes on amendments are likely to go all night, possibly Thursday. Senate Democrats have pledged to block any attempt to increase defense spending without also increasing spending for non-defense programs.” [Chad won’t leave you hanging - Fox News Senior Producer for Capitol Hill Chad Pergram details how this is a make or break week for the House: “[I]f things go well, the House Republican majority could score two of its biggest legislative victories in quite a while, demonstrating it can govern. The stakes are high as the GOP plans to debate and approve a budget. It’s a two-step in which Republicans slash spending but maneuver … to bolster defense programs, satisfying both fiscal conservatives and budget hawks. Or, the effort could blow up in the Republicans’ face.”] SO YOU’RE SAYING THE #RACETOGETHER TATTOO WAS A MISTAKE? Well, that was quick. Starbucks has already scrapped its promotion #RaceTogether, in which employees were to engage customers on the issue of race. The responses to what was deemed exploitative and obnoxious by commentators across the political spectrum were, ahem, not subtle. But to be fair, there have been worse corporate promotions. Like the time the Cleveland Indians sold beer for a dime or an environmental group’s exploitation of 9/11 or the offer of free food for life for those customers who got a tattoo of a San Francisco restaurant’s mascot.

"BOEHNER BATTLE SETS UP ANOTHER BUST Conservatives who demand maximal resistance to President Obama’s agenda have placed a new marker: the election for House Speaker set to be held as the new Congress convenes on Tuesday. Two Republican rivals to Speaker John Boehner have declared themselves, with Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas and Ted Yoho of Florida announcing their candidacies over the weekend. And as Alex Pappas reported, the leader of the effort to topple Boehner, Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., has spent weeks trying to build the 28-member coalition he needs to deny Boehner a 217-seat majority. The coverage has been intense, but is Boehner really in danger? Nope. Despite the announcement from at least six other GOP lawmakers that they won’t be voting for Boehner, this looks like a dead letter. [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel sets the scene for the incoming Congress.] Moral minority - Boehner’s supporters have pledged that even if the speaker fell short on the first ballot, they will hold successive votes until he is reelected. Even so, multiple ballots would be a moral victory for Boehner’s foes. History is certainly against the insurgents. No election of a speaker has gone beyond the first ballot since 1923, when Frederick Gillette, R-Mass., won re-election on the ninth ballot. Forcing so rare a moment would get attention for the movement and foreshadow deeper difficulties for Boehner on looming votes on immigration, spending, taxes and other hot topics. But is even a moral victory in reach? Nah. Whipped - Just look at the pool of potential votes for the Jones plan, which are presumably lawmakers from the most conservative districts in the country. Here’s one metric: Of the 30 House districts in which Obama fared the worst in 2012, many are represented by members of Boehner’s leadership team, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise and committee chairmen including Jason Chaffetz and Hal Rogers. And the same is true as you page through other less-red districts. The votes just aren’t there. A similar effort to unseat Boehner came to a clattering end in 2013, and the speaker has more clout now. With Republicans in control of the Senate, Boehner’s friendship is more valuable to ambitious members who would like to see bills passed and headlines made. These are not unknown facts to Jones & Co., who fell out with Boehner long ago. So what’s the point? [To do - You could scour around the Internet for 30 stories today about what to expect in the opening weeks and months of the 114th Congress, which convenes tomorrow. Or, you could just let David Drucker do the work for you.] Elimination round - There’s no downside for Jones, Yoho and Gohmert, who have already been frozen out of leadership love. The move generates attention and headlines from both conservatives yearning for a more ideological speaker as well as liberals who just want to see the fight. But there may be some downside for the movement the men seek to lead. This gambit stands to be another disappointment for an insurgency that came up empty with convoluted procedural plays on blocking Obama’s temporary executive amnesty as well as a bid to defund his health law. Failures such as these shrink rather than grow insurgencies, especially when they are conducted in very public fashion to the jeers of the press corps and pundit class. If the conservative rebels in the House and Senate make one resolution for 2015 it ought to be this: Next time, win one. MCCONNELL KINDLES HOPE ON TAX DEAL The Hill: “This much is true: Both President Obama and top Republicans are saying the right things about tax reform right now. Whether that means that the two sides will make the progress in 2015 necessary to overhaul the tax code before Obama leaves office is another question entirely…Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has said that tax reform is on the short list of issues - also including trade and infrastructure improvements - with the best chance for bipartisan cooperation once Republicans take full control on Capitol Hill in January. And Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who will be the House's top tax writer next year, has said he's willing to compromise on one of the GOP's top priorities for reform - that the individual and corporate systems be revamped together…And while Ryan has said that he's willing to work with Obama on tax reform, he's also been far from confident those discussions will lead to anything.”","323","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/05/boehner-battle-sets-up-another-bust.html"
"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... It is finally 2015, that far off exotic time that Marty McFly transported to in the 1989 classic, “Back the Future II”. The Atlantic compares the future McFly expected to find in 2015 to what really exists. Many of the technological predictions in the film came true in varying degrees however two key components missed were the development of Internet and the evolution of mobile phone technology. Cell phones didn’t exist in the film instead featuring banks of phone booths. The internet didn’t seem to exist in the film at least not in the individualized devices as expected today. JVC glasses are pretty close cousins to today’s Google Glass though not nearly as mobile as the Google device. Fax machines dominated business communication in the film, a technology that is just about obsolete today. To their credit, the filmmakers did accurately predict a smart watch, flat screen televisions and facial recognition technology. Society has yet to see the Hoverboards and flying cars featured in the film but have no fear there is still time as McFly didn’t go to the future until 4:29 pm on Wednesday October 21, 2015.

"SHOWTIME FOR WALKER IN WISCONSIN Today Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., on the short list of governors with 2016 GOP presidential potential, will be sworn in for his second term. With his sons emceeing the inaugural ceremony in Madison, Walker will reportedly push plans to grow the economy, develop the state’s workforce and reform education. And like other hopefuls, Walker knows that his words and record will be carefully scrutinized in a crowded field of potential 2016 nominees. “My ability to be even potentially a viable candidate is almost solely driven by how well we do in the state. If the state’s not doing well, I’m nothing — no possibility of being a candidate,” Governor Walker told WITI. Flashback: Walker-Christie a frosty pair - Amid his tough re-election battle last fall, Walker and potential 2016 rival Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., got into a tiff over whether the Republican Governors Association – with Christie at the helm – was supporting Walker with “sufficient enthusiasm and money.” [Timing may be everything - Watch Fox: Carl Cameron examines a busy 2015 calendar for potential 2016 candidates as they consider the best times to jump into the race.] No thaw in sight - One potential rub likely to keep up the Walker-Christie chill: the NFL playoffs. As a lifelong Wisconsinite, Walker often tweets his support of the Green Bay Packers. Christie’s football allegiances lay hundreds of miles south, in Dallas. Following the Dallas Cowboys win over the Detroit Lions Sunday, Christie was seen celebrating with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. The scene lit up social media, including ESPN analyst Skip Bayless who tweeted: “Chris Christie, you had better make plans to be in Green Bay, Wisconsin next weekend. You are needed.” This divisional playoff marks the first post season game at Lambeau Field between the two teams since the Ice Bowl of 1967. Christie to hit string of inaugurations in key 2016 states - Politico reports that Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., will attend a series of gubernatorial inaugurations in key 2016 states, beginning Tuesday with Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., followed by Gov. Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Gov. John Kasich in Ohio, Gov. Bruce Rauner in Illinois, Gov. Nikki Haley in South Carolina, and Gov. Terry Branstad in Iowa. HUCKABEE SCRAMBLES GOP FIELD We can’t yet know whether Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who on Saturday gave up his Fox News Channel show to pursue a presidential run, can upend the GOP field as he did with an upset victory in Iowa and seven other states in 2008. But he has already changed the race. The presidential aspirations of every other potential candidate counting on working-class voters and Evangelical Christians took a hit this weekend. That would certainly include Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Dr. Ben Carson and former Sen. Rick Santorum. Even libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., whose father saw strong support among Evangelicals in 2012, had to reconsider his strategy. Huckabee’s high name identification and durable popularity in Iowa and other states with large numbers of blue-collar Christian voters will make it harder for others to do as he did and use Iowa as a staging ground for a broader insurgency. Huckabee’s move raises interesting possibilities for mainstream candidates too. If Paul, Cruz, Santorum and Carson were all to proceed, the conservative vote in Iowa could be so splintered, that candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, might consider making a play in otherwise unwinnable Iowa. A tough fight for values voters would also create opportunities for Midwestern Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, John Kasich of Ohio and particularly Mike Pence of Indiana to try to run as fusion candidates. Dough, yo - WaPo: “If Mike Huckabee is going to make a serious run for the Republican presidential nomination, he will have to do something he was unable to do in 2008: raise millions of dollars and build a sprawling national campaign to complement the well of support he has among evangelicals and grass-roots activists in early primary states… A senior Huckabee aide … The aide said Huckabee’s team anticipates the need to raise about $50 million by the time of the Iowa caucuses in early 2016, with the money divided between the campaign’s budget and a super PAC, and said Huckabee has done much work to make that a reachable goal.” Perry prepping Iowa rollout - The Hill: “Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) is just weeks away from leaving office after more than a decade running Texas — and he is turning his eye beyond the Lone Star State as he looks to kick-start another presidential bid. Perry will leave the governor's mansion after 14 years on Jan. 20. Just a few days later, he’ll be in Iowa participating in the state’s first major candidate event of the 2016 campaign. … His Jan. 24 speech in Des Moines at the high-profile event organized by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and the conservative group Citizens United will be “very important for him,” according to one Perry ally.” Jindal, too - Des Moines Register: “Bobby Jindal’s [R-La.] Iowa caucus campaign test drive continues this week with events in front of a key demographic: conservative religious leaders. Jindal, the two-term Republican governor of Louisiana, is scheduled to meet politically active pastors in closed-door meetings in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids on Tuesday. Fate of Iowa Straw Poll to be decided Saturday - WashEx: “Republicans are examining the future of the Iowa Straw Poll, a key early measure of support for GOP presidential contenders. When members of the Iowa Republican Party central committee convene Saturday, they will decide whether the event, an institution in Republican presidential primaries since 1979, will continue — and what it will look like if it does.” [South Carolina Tea Party Coalition will feature 2016 Republican contenders, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Rick Santorum and Dr. Ben Carson at their convention later this month.] JEB RETURNS TO FAMILY’S POLITICAL SPAWNING GROUND Greenwich [Conn.] Times: “Jeb Bush’s [R-Fla.] flirtation with running for president in 2016 will take the former Florida governor to the familiar and lush stomping grounds of the Bush political clan: Greenwich. The Republican will raise money for his newly-created leadership PAC at a reception Wednesday in the hometown of his father, former President George H.W. Bush…The private reception is being organized by Craig and Debbie Walker Stapleton, he was U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic and then France under former President George W. Bush and she is a Bush cousin. The host committee also includes Richard Breeden, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Bush presidency, and David McCormick, a former Treasury undersecretary during the second Bush presidency who is president of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund…Greenwich was the home of the late Bush family patriarch Prescott Bush Sr., who served in the U.S. Senate and was the grandfather of Jeb Bush.” Double run helps Rand fund campaign infrastructure - National Journal: “Sen. Rand Paul [R-Ky.] could have a financial edge over many of his prospective presidential rivals in 2016 due to a quirk in timing and election law that lets him to tap his biggest donors for campaign cash twice. Paul has said he plans to seek Senate reelection and, if he runs, the Republican presidential nomination simultaneously. And because he would be campaigning for two federal offices, he would be eligible to have two open federal campaign committees at the same time. Thus, his largest donors could give $2,600 to his presidential primary campaign and another $2,600 to his Senate account for the primary. While federal rules do limit how he could spend the money, veteran election lawyers say diligent accounting could allow for legal cost-sharing between the two committees, saving Paul's presidential bid precious dollars and letting him collect bigger checks from his biggest contributors.” TOP IOWA DEMS NOT FEELING THE LOVE FOR HILLARY WSJ: “Iowa Democratic leaders say they are troubled by the prospect that Hillary Clinton could win the state’s 2016 presidential caucuses without a serious challenge, a view primarily rooted in a desire for a more liberal candidate or at least a robust debate about the party’s policies and direction. Interviews with more than half of Democratic chiefs in Iowa’s 99 counties show a state party leadership so far reluctant to coalesce behind Mrs. Clinton. County Democratic officials also voiced qualms about Mrs. Clinton’s ability to win a general election and her fundraising ties to Wall Street firms and corporations, which remain a target of liberal ire. Many county officials said they would like to see senators including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont enter the race, though they were split over whether any could gain traction and overtake Mrs. Clinton…Beyond the personal, some worry Mrs. Clinton might not be best-positioned to defeat the eventual Republican nominee, concerned her candidacy wouldn’t be exciting enough to draw in the younger voters who backed Mr. Obama.” THAT BAR IS FULL OF CLOWNS The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that Paul Miller plans to open Bircus Brewing Co. later this year, an offshoot of his current business Circus Mojo that currently operates in the city’s Ludlow Theater. Soon the brewery will run amidst the trapeze, high wire and other acts… including clowns. But Miller is well aware of potential customer fears; his clowns do not wear makeup. “You can be funny or funny looking,” Miller said. “We choose to be funny.” Whew. “Our goal is really to … have people be wowed by the destination of having some circus acts going on and pretty girls hanging from the ceiling,” said Miller, who founded Circus Mojo after his own circus and acting career.

"DRAMA ERUPTS ON PLANET HILLARY On the eve of one of the high holidays on Planet Hillary, the winter meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in New York, the bitter feuding long rumored to be simmering within Democratic 2016 frontrunner’s campaign erupted. One of Hillary Clinton’s top lieutenants, David Brock, fired off a letter resigning from the board of Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC funding what is expected to be a more-than $2 billion effort to return the Clintons to the White House. WaPo reports that Brock quit in an angry letter denouncing “an orchestrated political hit job” by his rivals inside the campaign that came in the form of a brutal NYT story on Brock’s fundraising efforts and huge commissions paid to a professional buckraker. Hours later, though, Brock offered to rejoin the 12-member board and board members promised they were “working to address” Brock’s concerns. As the Clinton campaign ponders when to make it official, keeping the team together looks like a major concern.","328","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/10/drama-erupts-on-planet-hillary.html"

"More money, more problems - The problem, of course, is the amount of money involved. While Hillary will not there today, her husband and daughter will be backscratching with leaders from big business and big labor in New York. And while the hundreds of millions of dollars the Clintons have raised for their foundation isn’t campaign cash, it’s all part of an empire built around the celebrity and potential return to power of the former first couple. And as the campaign prepares to file paperwork and the PACs prepare to start making larger payouts, the fight for control is evidently intensifying. Brock’s allegations read like he believes the many members of Team Obama and rival Clintonites were looking to elbow him out with allegations of impropriety right before the starting pistol fired.

"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Sky News reports that following his wife Kate Gross’s passing from terminal colon cancer at just 36, Billy Boyle developed a “cancer breathalyzer” which is designed to provide almost instantaneous detection results. The device, originally intended to detect explosives, but reformatted for medical usage, is set to be introduced in clinical trials to detect lung cancer. Certain types of cancer produce unique but nearly undetectable chemical traces at an early stage prior to symptoms becoming obvious thus improving survival odds. Boyle said, “The great thing is the technology exists today. We already have the microchip, we're working on small handheld devices in [a doctor’s] office.” During her battle, Boyle and his wife discussed possible applications of his company’s technology, “You develop technologies for a reason. Sometimes it's for monetary gain. Other times it's to make a difference.” Boyle is optimistic to have the system out to the public in the next two years with ambitious goals including “to save the NHS £245m - but more importantly to save 10,000 lives.” If successful there are plans to include tests for bowel cancer, tuberculosis and asthma.","345","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/10/drama-erupts-on-planet-hillary.html"

"OBAMA TO OUTLINE ISIS WAR PLAN AMID FUROR OVER TERROR COMMENTS Sources tell Fox News that President Obama will ask Congress Wednesday for formal authorization to use military force against ISIS, but many, including some Democrats, are concerned the request will be too timid. Such fears were deepened with the release of an interview the president gave to Vox, in which the president argued that Americans’ level of concern about terrorism was inflated by media hype. The president said that news outlets in search of ratings focused on Islamist terrorism rather than other pressing concerns, particularly global warming. In the interview, Obama also compared his role is dealing with Islamist militants to that of “a big city mayor” who has to “cut the crime rate down.” Obama also described the killing of four Jews at a Paris Kosher delicatessen in a January terror attack as having been conducted “randomly.”","348","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/10/drama-erupts-on-planet-hillary.html"

Appearing on “The O’Reilly Factor” on Monday, former top Obama adviser David Axelrod that Obama “absolutely” knew the comments would kick off a firestorm “I think he knew what he was saying and he knew that it was provocative,” Axelrod said. “His point is: Let us not define that entire quarter of planet by the actions of extremists.

The thinking there is that Democrats can call for a rule that would disadvantage them now, but do so knowing that Republicans are not going to destroy the filibuster they have long championed. Then, upon retaking the Senate, Democrats could go nuclear and change the rules to shut down the GOP minority saying. The best of both worlds, right?

"BUBBA'S BUCKRAKING POINTS TO MORE PROBLEMS FOR HILLARY Politico: “Less than a year after Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, former President Bill Clinton asked the State Department to approve a paid, videotaped speech he was asked to make at a gala in Shanghai, sponsored by a Chinese sports foundation. Wealthy hedge fund manager Kai Jiang wanted to pay the former president an undisclosed amount through a charity fund set up by his wife, Crystal Huang, a Chinese TV and film star who regularly serves as fodder for the Chinese tabloids. But unlike hundreds of big-dollar Bill Clinton speeches that sailed through a State Department ethics approval process while Hillary Clinton served as America’s top diplomat, this one raised a note of caution that the Chinese government might actually be funding the speech or planning to profit from it.” Early warning - Bubba’s overseas buckraking raised eyebrows last summer, as reported by WashEx: “A joint investigation by the Washington Examiner and the nonprofit watchdog group Judicial Watch found that former President Clinton gave 215 speeches and earned $48 million while his wife presided over U.S. foreign policy, raising questions about whether the Clintons fulfilled ethics agreements related to the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. …State Department officials charged with reviewing Bill Clinton's proposed speeches did not object to a single one.” Famed Chinese dissident contradicts Hillary’s claimed heroism - The Telegraph: “Hillary Clinton’s account of one of her crowning moments as secretary of state has been flatly contradicted by a leading Chinese activist. Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer who escaped house arrest and caused an diplomatic crisis between China and the US by taking refuge in the American embassy in Beijing in 2012, accused the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton of “giving in” to Chinese negotiators.” Hillary wants Americans out of ‘partisan bunkers’ and into ‘a nice purple space’ - WSJ: ‘There are a lot of things I would love to see our country do,’ she said. ‘I would like to bring people from the right, left, red and blue and get them into a nice purple space where everybody is talking and we’re actually trying to solve problems. That would be my objective if I decide to do this.’ … What if she could wave a wand and change one thing in America? [Re/code editor, Kara Swisher] asked. Mrs. Clinton said she would strive to ‘get back to working together cooperatively again. If we could get out of our mind-sets and our partisan bunkers…’” Hey, ladies - WaPo: “Declaring this the time to ‘crack every last glass ceiling,’ Hillary Rodham Clinton advocated forcefully here Tuesday for greater economic mobility for women…” Warren returns to deflections on candidacy - New York Daily News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.] shot down rumors of a 2016 presidential bid Tuesday while promoting a new initiative to bolster the middle class. ‘I don't think this is about me, I think this is really about this set of issues,’ the Massachusetts Democrat said on MSNBC's ‘Morning Joe’ during appearance to announce her new ‘Middle Class Prosperity Project.’ ‘What I want to do is to talk as hard and as long and as loud as I need to, to get people galvanized around change. This can't just be about politics,’ she added. ‘It's not just about one person. This is about when we get organized and say ‘enough of a Washington that works only for lobbyists and lawyers.’’ Warren, who appeared with Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, touted the program as an effort that would further reform student lending practices and help families with childcare costs.”","398","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/25/hillary-state-department-authorized-bubbas-sketchy-china-speech.html"
"""You know, I think that’s what we gotta see. I want to hear what she wants to run on and what she says she wants to do. That’s what campaigns are supposed to be about."" – Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., when asked by MSNBC whether Hillary Clinton would be a “progressive warrior.” Ahem: Biden to be given award for ‘distinguished’ service - Vice President Joe Biden hasn’t commented on his bizarre moment with the new Defense secretary’s wife or Biden’s demonstrably false, ethnically stereotyping about East African immigrants. To increase the awkwardness, Biden is being celebrated today in New Hampshire today with an awkwardly named award, given the vice president’s foibles. WMUR: “Vice President Joe Biden will receive the second Warren B. Rudman Award for Distinguished Public Service [today] when he visits the University of New Hampshire.” FCC BOSS DITCHES NET REGULATION HEARING The Hill: “The House Oversight Committee has postponed a hearing to explore whether the White House had undue influence on the Federal Communications Commission’s development of net neutrality rules. The announcement came after FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler declined to testify at Wednesday’s hearing, which would have come just a day ahead of the commission’s vote on the new regulations. Wheeler has agreed to testify at a later date, according to the FCC. House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said they were ‘deeply disappointed’ in Wheeler’s decision but promised that their probe would continue. ‘So long as the chairman continues to insist on secrecy, we will continue calling for more transparency and accountability at the commission,’ they said. ‘Chairman Wheeler and the FCC are not above Congress. This fight continues as the future of the Internet is at stake.’” [WaPo: “Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) isn’t giving up on net neutrality legislation. In fact, he’s still interested in finding alternatives to what the Federal Communications Commission has proposed as the strongest rules on Internet providers the country has ever seen. Contradicting a report by the New York Times Tuesday that Thune had ‘all but surrendered’ to Democrats and the FCC days ahead of an agency vote on net neutrality, a committee spokesperson said that the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee is still committed to finding a legislative solution…”] Why should you care? - Aside from the philosophical question of whether the government can or should have the power to regulate the internet, the regulations themselves could cause your binge-watching habits to be slightly more frustrating. With the new FCC rules, no Internet provider would be allowed to buy faster lines than another provider. So whether you have Comcast’s Xfinity or Time Warner, Frank Underwood’s diabolic takeover will take the same time to load. Hillary agrees with Silicon Valley donors - TIME: “Hillary Clinton said at a Silicon Valley conference for women leaders Tuesday that she supports President Barack Obama’s call for the strongest possible rules to safe guard net neutrality.” IMMIGRATION STANDOFF LIKELY TO END WITH A WHIMPER, NOT A BANG WaPo: “The Senate moved closer Tuesday to a deal to avert a partial shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, but the proposal faced an uncertain future in the House…Under [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s] proposal, the Senate would vote first on the funding measure and then hold a separate vote on a bill to undo Obama’s new immigration initiatives. McConnell hopes to assuage conservatives who are determined to confront the president on what they see as abuse of his executive authority…. But House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) did not immediately warm to the proposal, and it was not clear whether he could marshal enough backing in his chamber to complete the deal to keep DHS open beyond Friday, when its spending authority expires. House Republicans will huddle behind closed doors Wednesday morning.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Pity the poor black rat. No, seriously! Convicted by science for spreading the bubonic plague, the rat may have been wrongly accused. The death and destruction that ravaged Europe in the mid-14th century can indeed all be traced to a single furry critter going for a boat ride. But a new study published by the National Academy of Sciences suggests that the European outbreak of the Black Death actually began with a giant gerbil. The University of Oslo research draws the conclusion that weather conditions leading to the outbreaks were not conducive to fostering a rat population, but were perfect for gerbils. Maybe think twice before picking up one of those fuzzy, little buggers at the pet store. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

That’s twice as high as his nearest rival. The fight for second place is a close one. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul gets 13-percent of likely caucus goer support. Physician Ben Carson and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee pull in 11-percent, followed by former Governor Jeb Bush with 10-percent. None of the other possible candidates received more than five percent. [You can read the full poll results here.] Power Play: Press pugilism - Scott Walker is taking aim at the media, a potentially smart move in a party where the establishment press is reviled by many. But there are risks too. Chris Stirewalt has the answers in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE. Walker adds key Iowa operative - Des Moines Register: “Wordsmith and 20-year political operative Eric Woolson has signed on with likely presidential candidate Scott Walker’s team. … Last cycle, Woolson was state manager for social conservative Michele Bachmann’s presidential campaign … In 2008, Woolson was the Iowa campaign manager and communication director for presidential candidate Mike Huckabee …He was senior adviser for former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty’s presidential campaign in 2011… Woolson was also the Iowa communication director for three other GOP campaigns – U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley in 2010; Doug Gross for governor in 2002; and George W. Bush for president in 2000 …” AEI nabs big names for Georgia forum - Bloomberg: “Held at the remote, luxury Sea Island resort in Georgia, the 2015 American Enterprise Institute World Forum will bring together several potential GOP candidates and members of the business and media…Among the scheduled speakers at the exclusive event, which will be held from March 5-8, are Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, all of whom have been contemplating entering the 2016 presidential race.” Jeb sets pre-flight check for April 13 - WaPo: “Jeb Bush will hold a meeting with top donors to and fundraisers for his presidential campaign-in-waiting on April 13 in Miami, according to people familiar with the plans. The date, location and purpose of the meeting might appear to suggest that the former Florida governor and Miami-area resident will announce that he is indeed mounting a campaign for the White House, or release the early numbers of his fundraising push for his leadership PAC and super PAC. But aides stressed on Tuesday that for now, at least, observers shouldn't expect Bush to use the meeting as the formal launch of his campaign. They also noted that fundraising totals won't necessarily be announced, especially since a first-quarter tally isn't due to the Federal Election Commission until July.” Jeb jab: Rubio draws contrast with ‘the son of a president’ - WaPo: “Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida used his first trip of the year to New Hampshire Tuesday to stress his working-class and immigrant family experiences, appearing to draw a stark contrast with potential rival Jeb Bush in the process. In a speech at the popular Politics & Eggs breakfast forum here, Rubio said that if his parents had not emigrated to the United States in 1956, ‘there’s no way in the world that I could have the same dreams, and potentially the same future, as the son of a president or the son of a millionaire.’” Perry’s brand is ‘politics of unity and aspiration’ - Houston Chronicle: “Former Gov. Rick Perry, on the stump ahead of a likely 2016 presidential campaign, continued his transformation Tuesday night from conservative warrior to hopeful uniter, telling Virginia Republicans they deserve a less divisive commander-in-chief. ‘For too long, our leaders have pitted American against American on the basis of their faith or their gender or their race or their income,’ Perry said during a speech in Richmond. ‘It's time to abandon this cynical formula of politics and replace it with the politics of unity and aspiration.’” McConnell backs Rand’s plan for Kentucky caucus - Lexington Herald-Leader: “U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed U.S. Sen. Rand Paul’s push for a Republican presidential caucus in Kentucky, lending heavy weight Tuesday to a proposal that had raised concerns among some members of the state GOP's executive committee. Paul’s push for a caucus in early 2016 would allow him to run for two offices during the 2016 Republican primary season without violating a Kentucky law that prohibits a candidate from appearing on the same ballot twice. The idea was initially met with ‘respectful skepticism’ from McConnell, but after the two men met Monday to discuss the matter, McConnell decided to throw his support behind the idea.” Cruz adds fundraising heavyweight - Dallas Morning News: “The budding Cruz 2016 campaign is adding some fund-raising muscle, with the Texas GOP finance chairman joining the effort. Hal Lambert, a Fort Worth money manager who has served three years as the state party’s top fund-raiser, said Tuesday that he is stepping down to help Sen. Ted Cruz if he runs for president. Lambert supported the 2012 presidential campaign of then-Gov. Rick Perry, who, like Cruz, has been spending lots of time with Republican activists in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, where early contests are critical stops on the way to the White House.” Kasich offers fiscal hawk stance - Cleveland Plain Dealer: “…while delivering his State of the State address here Tuesday evening, [Ohio Gov. John Kasich] sounded very much like a guy who wants to do more as governor. ‘I'm optimistic about what we can achieve,’ Kasich said as he closed his remarks. ‘And I'm going to be here working with you, shoulder to shoulder. I'm here to serve.’ …He badly wants his fellow Republicans, who have firm majorities in the House and Senate, to accept his budget proposal. Kasich hopes lawmakers will choke down higher sales taxes, higher cigarette taxes and higher taxes on Big Oil in exchange for lower income taxes, which the governor believes will spur job growth.” Carly joins the PAC - Carly for America: “In advance of Carly Fiorina’s speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday, Feb. 26, Fiorina supporters are launching Carly For America, a SuperPac to lay the groundwork for a potential presidential run. ‘As Carly decides whether to enter into the 2016 race, Carly For America will continue to build conservative support and help lay the groundwork for a potential presidential candidacy,’ said Steve DeMaura, executive director of the SuperPac.” Teachers union says Christie exaggerated scope of budget deal - New Jersey Star-Ledger: “The teachers union Gov. Chris Christie touted as an ally today in his annual state budget address says the governor ‘overstated’ their partnership…The union was swift to respond, declaring ‘politics trumped policy’ in the governor’s address. ‘NJEA is deeply disappointed that Gov. Chris Christie overstated the nature of the understanding we reached with the commission after many months of conversation,’ NJEA President Wendell Steinhauer said in a statement, less than two hours after Christie's speech. ‘We have not agreed to any changes to pensions or health benefits,’ he said. ‘We have only agreed to continue looking at all solutions that may provide our members with more stable pensions and affordable, high-quality benefits.’” Carson campaign adds another Gingrich hand - Daily Caller: “Neurosurgeon Ben Carson has hired a national finance director in anticipation of entering the 2016 race for the White House. Carson adviser Terry Giles told The Daily Caller on Tuesday that Amy Pass, president of The Pass Group, LLC, will serve as national finance director of the presidential campaign if Carson decides to run as a Republican, as expected. Pass, according to Giles, is a former fundraiser for Newt Gingrich who helped raise more than $52 million for his 527 organization, American Solutions. She also served as national finance director for Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign.” STRICKLAND WILL TAKE ON PORTMAN Youngstown (Ohio) Vindicator: “Ex-Gov. Ted Strickland announced today that he would be a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2016 ‘because I am determined to restore the American Dream for working people in this country.’ Strickland said in a prepared statement that knows personally ‘how difficult it is to move up in this world, and the deck is increasingly stacked against working people.’ … U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, the Republican incumbent, will seek his second six-year term next year….Strickland served 12 years in the U.S. House and won the 2006 gubernatorial race. He lost his re-election to Republican John Kasich in 2010 by 2 percentage points.” NRSC dings Hassan on plan to add a ‘chief operating officer’ - New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan is the leading Democratic contender to take on Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte next year. But Hassan’s proposal for the state to add a “chief operating officer” to help run state agencies is causing her some headaches. Since Hassan is the state’s chief executive, the plan has been widely derided as duty ducking. The NRSC is capitalizing on the flap with a new video calling the proposal an effort by Hassan to shirk her statehouse duty while she runs against Ayotte. ACT NOW, AND HE’LL THROW IN HIS DIRTY DISHES Boston Globe reports Kyle Waring of Massachusetts decided to sell the snow over the internet. Waring charges 89 dollars for six pounds of snow, which he ships in an insulated container to prevent melting. He sold four boxes of snow in 24 hours, and expects the trend to continue. “At this rate, it’s going to be July until the snow melts,” he said. “But I’ve thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items. Maybe I’ll ship some fall foliage.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “These last details that are coming out now about the agreement being time-limited - meaning that in a decade, Iran can essentially become a legitimate nuclear power, develop its weapons, without any restraints - and, remember, this will mean a lifting of the sanctions, so Iran will be with a very strong economy, undeterred, nothing in any way holding it back - is simply catastrophic.” —Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"SHOVEL READY: TEAM OBAMA SEES ISLAMIST THREAT AS JOBS PROBLEM Today is the start of the White House conference on “violent extremism,” which is the administration’s preferred euphemism for Islamist terrorism and militancy. The point is to gather government officials from around the world to discuss strategies for dealing with extremists of every kind. The actual purpose is to show that the president is doing something about a war effort Americans are deeply dubious about . One of the spokeswomen for the State Department certainly set the tone for the big to-do in an interview with MSNBC. And Marie Harf certainly had a doozy of a Kinsley gaffe. She explained to an exasperated Chris Matthews that it wasn’t about winning military conflict with ISIS or other Islamist militants, but rather dealing with “root causes.” She offered this to Matthews demand for a more robust offensive: “…we cannot win this war by killing them, we cannot kill our way out of this war.” So what is the way to victory? “We need, in the longer term, medium and longer term, to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it’s lack of opportunity for jobs...” Ah. [WashEx: “According to a Brookings Institution survey of American Political Science Association scholars, they put Obama on the worst, not best, list by a margin of nearly three-to-one.”] ‘And his momma cried…’ - “Good jobs for good wages” sounds like an increasingly far-fetched campaign slogan in several parts of America as salary stagnation remains upon us. But if you think selling it Nashua, N.H. is tough, try Yemen. When people are eating grass and dirt, long-term economic recovery would sound just plain silly. When they’re eating grass with murderous Islamists pointing Kalashnikovs at them, it would sound downright cruel. But that’s what Harf said. She argued that the U.S. should work to end to the poverty that “makes these 17-year-old kids pick up an AK-47” instead of “trying to start a business.” In this version, a budding entrepreneur is trapped in a hopeless society and eventually turns to “violent extremism” [wink, wink] in frustration. It is like Elvis Presley’s “In the Ghetto” but for global Jihad. This doesn’t quite explain why certain poor people are peaceful while others seem to be increasingly falling prey to “violent extremism” [nudge, nudge] but it’s not an insane point of view… for an Elvis song, or Methodists missionaries or the International Monetary Fund. For the government that is charged with protecting America, however, this is some wild stuff. [WaPo: “Shiite militias backed by Iran are increasingly taking the lead in Iraq’s fight against the Islamic State, threatening to undermine U.S. strategies intended to bolster the central government, rebuild the Iraqi army and promote reconciliation with the country’s embittered Sunni minority.”] More vox, less populi - Leave aside the issue of whether Islamist militants are actually primary causes of much of the economic suffering of these nations. The real deal here is how long such a strategy might take given the nature of the economic disadvantage in the countries where Islamists are running riot. We’re talking decades or centuries. That’s a pretty stunning lack of urgency. But it seems to be in keeping with the president’s recently outlined position that Americans’ worries about Islamists are a media-driven distraction from other issues. The real things are global warming and sustainable agriculture, you see. Beheading people or shooting up a magazine office is just a symptom… As it becomes clearer that this really is the administration’s view the president and his party (and its presumptive nominee) will pay a heavy political price. BAIER TRACKS: COURT SHAKES UP AMNESTY FIGHT ON HILL… “As is so often the case, states lead the way. A lawsuit filed by 26 states against President Obama’s executive actions on immigration, took a big step forward. On Monday, a federal judge blocked the president’s actions granting legal status to millions of illegal immigrants. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen’s decision puts a freeze on the president’s plan, the first phase of which was supposed to begin Wednesday. While the administration will no doubt appeal the ruling, this decision could provide a legislative opening for the Homeland Security funding bill that is stalled in the Senate. The bill is being blocked by Democrats and would also be certainly vetoed by the President should it pass. So what is the way out of the standoff? The Republican argument may be to ask how they could fund anything that has been blocked by the courts and go full steam ahead on offense. Or, Republicans may be so encouraged about the chance for legal remedy that the looming showdown is drained of some of its urgency and move toward compromise. We’ll see what they choose.” – Bret Baier. Pump it up - The Hill: “The Obama administration is ratcheting up pressure on Republicans to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which faces a shutdown without action by Congress after Feb. 27. Congress appears stuck on the issue because the House is insisting that the funding bill also overturn President Obama's executive actions on immigration that have provided legal status and work permits to millions of immigrants…Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and other agency officials are also expected to press the case over the coming days, with one senior official there calling the push for full funding a ‘huge priority for this department.’ Johnson is trying to convince Republicans to bend. The department says Johnson has already visited with at least 20 lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss the funding situation, and placed more than a dozen phone calls to members.” OBAMACARE DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR SOME The Hill: “The Obama administration is giving some customers an extra week to buy health insurance if they have faced long wait times or other issues when trying to submit applications over the final sign-up weekend. Customers who experienced difficulties with ObamaCare signups will have until Sunday to buy coverage, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] announced in a statement one day after the official enrollment period ended.” [Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream has the latest on ObamaCare.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... While the celebrations of Mardi Gras in New Orleans and Carnival in Brazil get all the attention, today is significant for Christians all over the world as the last day before the start of Lent, a season of somber reflection before the faith’s highest holiday, Easter. But for many, the feasting and revelry done with abandon on Bourbon Street or in Rio is replaced by the humble pancake. The English-born tradition of a modest feast on Shrove Tuesday (derived from the word “shrive,” meaning to present oneself for penance or confession) has become synonymous with pancake suppers, which once sounded like a pretty tame as an indulgence by American standards. But given current dietary attitudes about sugar, gluten and fat, pancakes have returned to a position of decadence. So this brings us to a key question of doctrine: Thick or thin? While there are many devotees of flapjacks as thick as a pillow, making those is as simple as following the directions on a store-bought box. But if you want to go thin to win, here’s how: Mix two teaspoons of sugar very thoroughly into two eggs. Then stir in 3 cups of milk and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Then gently add just one-and-a-quarter cups of white flour until the batter is combined but not perfectly smooth. Let the batter stand for 15 minutes. Then heat up your best cast-iron skillet to medium-high and slide in a pat of butter. Pour a ladleful of batter into the foamy butter and cook for a couple of minutes until nicely browned. Flip it over and even up the other side for about a minute. Serve hot with butter and either jelly or powdered sugar and lemon. A few plates of those will keep you feeling penitent for at least 40 days! Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

With almost a year to go until the first votes are cast, the first ads are out. RealClearPolitics: “[The] campaign that will document each time a Republican candidate ‘ignores, insults, or offends’ American women. The ‘Insult & Injury’ initiative, first shared with RealClearPolitics, includes digital advertising and graphics that can be shared via social media…. EMILY’s List is targeting Republican presidential candidates’ opposition to Planned Parenthood and/or their efforts to defund it, as well as their opposition to raising the federal minimum wage, which the group argues disproportionately affects women.” Coming out party - Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, is slated to keynote EMILY’S List’s 30th anniversary gala March 3. The speech before the group, which is a pillar of the machine backing her probable bid for the White House, will be Clinton’s first appearance before a political organization this year. [GOP 2016 hopeful Ben Carson is scheduled to speak today at the Parkgate Pregnancy Clinic in Tupelo, Mississippi.] Time for choosing - WashEx’s Noemie Emery observes that Hillary has a tough choice to make: “Her problem has been getting voters as enthused about herself as she is, leaving her to: A) Play the woman card, which becomes less specific to her as many more women rise to high office; and B) go the Gore/Kerry/Romney route of trying to bend herself into the image of what polls suggest voters find appealing.” [In an extensive National Journal interview, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina criticizes Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton saying she “will play the gender card over and over again, which is unfortunate but predictable.”] Hush - Clintonites are getting annoyed at David Axelrod, former top strategist to President Obama, for a rash of comments about Hillary and her potential campaign. “‘It’s not helpful and it’s definitely not appreciated,’ [a Clinton ally told The Hill]. ‘The last thing we need is another round of headlines about lingering tension and this is doing exactly that. ‘When he speaks, it gets picked up and people listen,’ the ally added.” It could hurt his hopes?

So when Gov. Scott Walker, a second-term Republican, presented a budget this month proposing to delete some of its most soaring passages, as well as to sharply cut state aid to the system, he ignited a furious backlash that crossed party and regional lines…” Howdy, neighbor - Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is the featured guest speaker tonight at the Lincoln Reagan Day dinner in Clermont, Ohio. Christie puts corporate tax reform at the top of his presidential priorities - [New Jersey] Star-Ledger: “Gov. Chris Christie gave the first glimpse of what he'd do if Americans elected him to the White House while speaking to New Hampshire Republicans in the presidential battleground state tonight. ‘Within the first 100 days, if I were to run for president and be elected, we would change this tax system in this country so that people and companies aren't leaving the country anymore,’ Christie said during a brief question and answer session with audience members at the Concord and Merrimack County GOP Annual Lincoln Reagan Day Dinner. ‘Secondly, we would pass a national energy policy, and one that takes full advantage of all of the resources that we have available to us to help grow our economy and make the world a more peaceful and stable place,’ he said. ‘And the third thing is ... is to reestablish American leadership around the world.’” Glad I caught you - David Drucker is keeping track of which Republican lawmakers’ phones are ringing with calls from GOP Sixteeners in pursuit of a well-timed endorsement. On the list of sought after would-be backers: Sens. Tim Scott, R-S.C., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo. Sound off: Readers respond to this week’s 2016 Power Index… “I think that former Texas Governor Rick Perry remains one of the most underrated candidates in this Presidential cycle and this will play to his advantage in 2016. He’s got a veteran, he’s a patriot and more importantly, he’s got the experience and the record. He’s the one to watch this Presidential cycle.”--Ian Tan, Perth, Australia “My overwhelming choice though has to be Rick Perry who ran the second largest state for FOURTEEN years with balanced budgets, and left Billions of Dollars in a ‘Rainy Day Fund.’ During Obama's reign - Perry has helped Texas create one-third of ALL the jobs created in the U.S. That's the leadership we need.”--Doug Mathes, Houston, Texas. “In a state brimming with potential 2016 Presidential candidates, the voters are talking about [Scott Walker]. Not Rand Paul whose father hails from Texas as does Jeb Bush and of course our former outstanding Governor Rick Perry and our rock star Senator Ted Cruz. I mean shazam that's four fabulous candidates with Texas roots vying for the support and cash of the Big Boys here.”--Lori Haughton, Dallas, Texas. “John Kasich is the only one with the background to be the next president, with experience in congress and a governor of a large industrial state and wants an amendment to the constitution for a balanced budget.

These are the blue-chip recruits many Democrats believe are essential to winning back control of the U.S. Senate in 2016 after a midterm drubbing cost them their majority. Less than four months after the painful losses, Democratic officials have begun charting a path back to Senate control that runs through more than half a dozen blue and purple states where the presidential campaign is expected to boost Democratic turnout. But even in that favorable terrain, the party faithful fear they could fall short if marquee challengers don’t step forward, since their talent pool is shallow and they are trying to unseat a well-prepared group of Republican senators.” SHHHHHH…. If you are longing for some peace and quiet, the American Association for the Advancement of Science has the spots for you. In their latest research, scientists have mapped the noise levels across the country on an average summer day. Using acoustic data fed into a computer algorithm researchers modeled gradations in audio levels including variables such as air and street traffic. The deepest blues predominantly occurred in the western portions of the country including Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and the Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado. These areas had levels under 20 decibels similar levels as prior to European colonization, significantly lower than most cities which averaged 50 to 60 decibels. The National Park Service will put the research to use identifying where human noise affects that are considerably more sensitive than human ears and impacts the animals’ abilities to hunt small insects and rodents. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “[T]he ideology of ISIS is clearly supremacist in the sense that anybody who is not Islamic in their understanding is to be either enslaved or eradicated in a genocidal movement. You kill Christians, you kill Jews you kill Yazidis but you may in certain circumstances, enslave them, that’s what we’re up against. And we have an administration that will not even admit there is a religious basis underline what’s going on.” —Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"WORD SALAD: TEAM OBAMA OFFERS FOREIGN POLICY RATIONALE The Obama administration will release today its National Security Strategy, a congressionally mandated statement of presidential priorities. Does it matter? Well, releasing a document at this moment that administration officials said will offer a “full-throated affirmation of President Obama’s strategic commitment to deepening American engagement and investment in the Asia-Pacific region” could almost be taken as farce, so one might be forgiven for ignoring the matter entirely. But that would be a mistake. In what will be only the third installment in 13 years of what is supposed to be an annual report to Congress, we can expect thousands of lines of mostly meaningless syntax. Like the Olive Garden for word salad, there will be unlimited refills. But why now, after a five year lapse? The best guess is that it is because the administration is currently turning endless summersaults on foreign policy: The Ukraine policy is working… Wait, it’s not so we are going to start dumping weapons in Eastern Europe. Yemen is a model for the war on ISIS…. Wait, Yemen is a catastrophe. Iran is on the brink of a peace deal… Wait, we need an endless extension. And Libya... well, let’s just forget about that one. As the administration prepares to face a restive, anxious Congress, included deeply divided Democrats, on these issues, regurgitating platitudes will do little to convince lawmakers that there is anything more to the president’s foreign policy plans than caroming from crisis to crisis. Obama faces tough sale to Dems on OK to fight ISIS - While the White House expected to formally ask to Congress to authorize the use of military force against the Islamic State terror group within days, President Obama’s toughest customers in selling his plan are likely to be members of his own party. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that the administration is seeking bi-partisan backing on specific provisions, including how long the authorization will last, what geographical areas it will cover and whether it will allow for the possibility of ground troops. Some Democrats though, frustrated by the president’s inaction have openly bucked the White House, are pushing their own proposals. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, said talks with the administration are focusing on an authorization time frame of three years. “I’m not saying anybody’s come to an agreement on it,” Pelosi said. “I think it’s going to be a challenge, but we will have it.” House Speaker John Boehner said he doesn’t want to see the president’s hands tied when it comes to fighting a war, but added, “It’s also incumbent on the president to make the case to the American people on why we need to fight this fight. This is not going to be an easy lift.”","441","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/06/word-salad-team-obama-offers-foreign-policy-rationale.html"
"“[T]he Obama administration is telling the enemy what we’re not going to do. You know, we’re not going to do this and we’re not going to do that and this is when we're pulling out. We have got to let the military do what it can to address this at the military level and use all elements of national power, obviously, to defeat and destroy this threat.” --Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., on “The Kelly File” Watch here. Calls grow to arm Ukraine, as European leaders scramble for last-ditch peace plan - Fox News: “European leaders scrambled Thursday to try and forge a diplomatic deal to end fighting in eastern Ukraine, in an apparent bid to head off U.S. consideration of lethal military aid for the Ukrainian government in its war against Russian-backed separatists. At the same time, a bipartisan call in Congress for the U.S. to arm Ukraine was only growing, with lawmakers saying the military aid ‘is past due.’…Top Obama officials are weighing pleas from both sides, without tipping their hand as to the next step as they hold a flurry of meetings with European counterparts. Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with top Ukrainian officials in Kiev on Thursday, offered no definitive decision on the question of lethal aid. But he said President Obama is reviewing all options, including ‘the possibility of providing defensive systems to Ukraine.’…Kerry, meanwhile, brought $16.4 million in new humanitarian aid to Ukraine.” SASSE WARNS OF $24,000 ‘AMNESTY BONUS’ FOR ILLEGALS Daniel Halper reports: “[President Obama] has promoted his recent executive action on immigration by arguing that he’s only deferring action – holding off on enforcement of the current immigration laws until an immigration reform he approves of passes Congress. But that's not really true; in fact there’s a way for illegal immigrants immediately to receive ‘amnesty bonuses,’ as [Sen. Ben Sasse R-Neb.] terms it. Here’s how. A recent Homeland Security Committee hearing on immigration revealed an alarming consequence of [Obama’s] executive amnesty—that illegal immigrants with deferred status may be able to receive the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Moreover, this person, who is here in the U.S. unlawfully, could be able to file an amended tax return for up to the last three tax years, possibly receiving upwards of $24,000 in tax credits.” [C’mon back - The Hill: “The IRS rehired hundreds of former staffers with conduct issues, even bringing ex-employees with tax issues back into the fold, a new federal audit has found. … Of those rehired, roughly one in five then went on to have further performance problems.”] Power Play: Do Dems face dangers on amnesty? - With Homeland Security Department funding hanging in the balance, WashEx’s Susan Crabtree and Roll Call’s Emma Dumain, join Power Play host Chris Stirewalt to discuss attempts in Congress to cut funds for the President’s executive action granting temporary amnesty to illegal immigrants.

In his 1988 farewell speech from the Oval Office, the 40th president reflected on the values he held most precious: “When you’ve got to the point when you can celebrate the anniversaries of your 39th birthday you can sit back sometimes, review your life, and see it flowing before you. For me there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the middle of my life. I never meant to go into politics. It wasn't my intention when I was young. But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the blessings bestowed on you. I was happy with my career in the entertainment world, but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something precious. Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government, and with three little words: 'We the People.' 'We the People' tell the government what to do; it doesn't tell us. ‘We the People’ are the driver; the government is the car. And we decide where it should go, and by what route, and how fast. Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are. Our Constitution is a document in which 'We the People' tell the government what it is allowed to do. 'We the People' are free.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

For Hillary Clinton there’s no challenger in sight, so what about debates? Does the presumptive 2016 Democratic nominee forego them or provide a stage that could elevate an insurgent bid? WashEx’s Susan Crabtree and Roll Call’s Emma Dumain join Power Play host Chris Stirewalt to suss out the blue team’s strategy. WATCH HERE. Oppo - The pro-Republican group America Rising has launched a new Facebook page, “Hiding Hillary,” which chronicles Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential “campaign.” Hillary was deemed too cautious and calculating in 2008, a trend that seems to be repeating itself. The site is designed to highlight the internal Democratic squabbles about ducking debates and delaying official campaign announcements. Back to the mothership - NYT: “Mandy Grunwald, an adviser to the Clintons for over two decades and a top strategist to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, is expected to serve as a senior adviser for communications to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s all-but-certain presidential bid. Ms. Grunwald will advise Mrs. Clinton on strategy and make some of the television ads along with Jim Margolis, whose firm, GMMB, is expected to take the lead on producing and buying the commercials. The pollster Joel Benenson is another senior adviser poised to work for Mrs. Clinton on her second White House run. Ms. Grunwald, an original member of Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign team who also worked on Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 White House bid, represents a nod to continuity after a stream of recent stories about Mrs. Clinton’s plans to hire advisers close to her one-time rival for the White House, President Obama.” MAYBE SHE JUST THINKS YOUR HATS ARE UGLY An Oregon owl is stealing the hats of early morning joggers and park visitors near Salem. As Reuters reports, the bird has attacked at least four individuals in the last month and swiped their hats. No one has been seriously hurt in any of the incidents but officials have never seen anything like this before. Brad Hilliard was one of the joggers struck in the thefts, said, “It was kind of amazing how it just swooped down and grabbed my hat like that.” The bird appears to be targeting people near Bush’s Pasture Park which has now put up signs warning of the possibility of a bird strike and to avoid jogging before dawn (or consider wearing a hard hat). The Audubon Society believes it is just a single barred owl causing such a ruckus, possibly because it is nesting season. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “[President Obama] seems to have this desire, whether it’s because he thinks we will overreact or because he genuinely believes that this is not the threat that Jordan thinks it is, that Americans think it is, that the Saudis do, the Gulf Arabs, they are apoplectic about Obama’s inaction and he doesn’t even supply the Jordanians with the weapons that they need.

"TEAM OBAMA GIVES HILLARY THE COAKLEY TREATMENT What could have possibly impelled Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton to deliver a paid speech to Silicon Valley executives this week? The event was unannounced and closed to reporters and came just one day after her testy standoff with press over her decision to destroy tens of thousands of emails from her time as Secretary of State. Who would make a cash dash in the midst of bungling the response to a foreseeable scandal that has supporters questioning their judgment? It couldn’t really be greed that would drive a woman so wealthy to take such a risk in ducking reporters, especially to do the kind of buck raking that has already damaged her image. So it must be that Clinton doesn’t understand the extremity of her situation. In politics, professionals complain about “undisciplined” candidates. Those folks generally fall into one of two categories: The train wrecks who know what they’re supposed to do, but lack the self-control to do it or those who can’t or won’t see what’s going on. It would seem that Clinton is the latter. She doesn’t “get it.” Some combination of bubble-wrapped obliviousness and willful ignorance seems to be keeping her from doing what it takes to win. Nobody sees that more clearly than the members of Team Obama, who, aside from helping to deliver a drip-drip-drip of steadily negative news about the actual facts of Clinton’s email scandal, are currently giving Clinton the Coakley treatment. That got crystal clear on Thursday with a blind-quote bonanza in Politico, the spirit of which is reflected here: “The Democratic nomination is all but hers, the Republican field still looking weak to them, and they’re counting on her. And now? To sum up the feelings, all the way up to the highest levels: What. The. Hell.” The tone here is one of concern, but also of building an, er, firewall against future foibles: “They’re just hoping that this email server – ‘the president 100 percent would not have done it this way,’ the former aide said, ‘this is such a clearly nontransparent way of going about it’ – is the extent of the latitude she took that they didn’t know about.” There are only a few weeks left for Democrats to decide whether or not to try to topple Clinton, and it seems highly unlikely that anyone with enough clout would make the leap in time. But as we watch Obamaland start to quarantine Clinton, lest an outbreak spread to the president’s legacy project, the possibility of a real primary gets more real. It is certainly true that President Obama has a great deal invested in having a Democratic successor, especially since he is using executive authority to keep a wobbly agenda in place. And it is also true that Clinton represents the most likely path to that objective. But, the Obamanauts hold themselves in such high esteem and take such a low view of Clintonian politics that it wouldn’t take much more to tip the whole thing over. In the Politico piece, the White House crew speaks in disappointment, not anger, saying they thought Clinton had changed. And what did she need to change from? Consider this gem: “‘You never feel like you’re quite getting the full story, because everyone’s got some side deal or some complicating factor,’ said one former Obama aide, reflecting on dealing with Clinton and her circle. ‘I don’t think there was a conscious effort to watch out for scams. It was more just, you know who you’re dealing with.’” Sounds marvelous… [Watch Fox: Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry has the latest on the Hillary email scandal.] #mediabuzz - This week Howard Kurtz welcomes a slew of guests including Ron Fournier to discuss the challenge of covering the Clintons for three decades.

"Power Play: Are Dem challengers for real? - Amid Hillary Clinton’s email scandal, Democrats are thinking she needs a challenger or if things get worse, a replacement. Democratic operative Christy Setzer and Republican strategist Matt Keelen discuss possible candidates for that role with Chris Stirewalt. WATCH HERE. Warren the ‘escape valve’ to help Hillary? - Jim O’Sullivan of the Boston Globe writes: “Perhaps the more interesting question is how tenderly Warren treats a nominee Clinton. She could function as a hard-line truth-teller who holds Clinton to account when her circle of advisers leans a little Wall Streety for Warren’s taste. Or she could rank party politics above principle and give Clinton all the slack she needs. ‘Is she a pain in the ass or an escape valve? I think she’ll be more of an escape valve,’ said one person who has known Warren since before she entered electoral politics. ‘I think she will rally the left and explain to them the possibilities of a Clinton presidency.’” O’Malley tests Hillary hits - Politico:Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley says if he were president, it would be important as commander in chief to have his secretary of state use the official server for business. ‘Well sure, it would be important to me,’ he said Thursday on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’ when asked about Hillary Clinton’s email practices at the State Department. But he said getting the economy working would be more important. O’Malley said he didn’t ‘feel compelled to answer’ a follow-up question about Clinton’s actions from Bloomberg Politics’ John Heilemann. ‘Secretary Clinton is perfectly capable of defending her own service in office,’ he said.” Webb seems to be going through with it - WTVR: “Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb will visit Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina in the coming months, stacking his schedule with visits to early presidential primary states as he ‘seriously considers’ a 2016 run. Webb, a Democrat, will first travel to South Carolina, where the former senator will headline a fundraiser for House Democratic Leader Todd Rutherford and Richland County State Rep. Mia McLeod on March 18 in Columbia. … Webb’s staff announced that the possible presidential contender would headline the Polk County Democrats awards dinner in Iowa on April 10… Webb is also planning a trip back to South Carolina on May 25 and plans to visit New Hampshire in early June.” [Watch Fox: Former Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., is featured in the 2016 contender series on “Special Report with Bret Baier” tonight at 6 p.m. ET.] WALKER OPENS NEW HAMPSHIRE TRIP WITH HARD HIT ON JEB In an interview with Adam Smith from the Tampa Bay times, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, freshly arrived in Manchester, N.H. came out swinging against the frontrunner, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: ""We had Bob Dole, John McCain, Mitt Romney. If it's just whoever's next up, that hasn't worked so well for the Republican Party in the past. ... Jeb’s a good man. You’re not going to hear me speak ill will of Jeb. He’s a friend of mine, He called me two days before (announcing) his PAC, I think highly of him. I just think voters are going to look at this and say, ‘If we’re running against Hillary Clinton, we’ll need a name from the future - not a name from the past - to win.’” “[Bush will] have by far the biggest [fundraising] report. There’s a lot of people who are loyal to that family because of an ambassadorship or an appointment or something like that, so those people are going to show up big on his first report. What we’re hoping going forward are not donors of obligation but donors of passion, people who are passionate about the reforms we bring to the table.” – Scott Walker, from an interview with the Tampa Bay Times. Vitriolic moderation - In his first visit to the Granite State in 15 years, Bush will make a two-day swing through the state, beginning with a business round table discussion today followed by a party at the home of Fergus Cullen, former chairman of the New Hampshire state GOP. Appearing with Cullen is not a move likely to endear Bush to New Hampshire conservatives. Cullen displayed his disdain for right-wing activists in a radio interview, explaining that Sen. Ted Cruz would not be welcome at his home because Cruz represents “everything that is wrong with the Republican Party in Washington these days.” Cruz will attend a chili lunch with the Strafford County Republican Committee before he delivers remarks Sunday night at the Grafton County Lincoln-Reagan Dinner in Lincoln, New Hampshire. Cruz will return later this month to rally young conservatives. [AP: “Among the many thousands of emails Jeb Bush received as Florida governor are a string of notes from campaign donors asking for favors and making suggestions. Invariably, Bush responded quickly. Sometimes, he appointed a person a donor had recommended for a position. Other times, he rejected advice about a piece of legislation. It’s an insight into Bush’s work as governor that’s possible only because his emails are open for review, something not yet available for those sent and received by Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state.”] Walker working hard - Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., joins the party in New Hampshire with an aggressive campaign schedule including more than a dozen stops in two days. Walker is attending meetings with political and business leaders today as well as sitting down for interviews with local media outlets. Walker is also scheduled to participate in the grassroots training session in Concord on Saturday. [Could Walker’s love of hunting and snowmobiling be a key to unlocking Granite State votes? Maybe so.] Who’s ‘we’? - Bloomberg: “The Wisconsin governor and likely 2016 Republican candidate sounded downright bullish when asked this week how it felt to be singled out for criticism by President Barack Obama after [Walker] signed so-called right-to-work legislation. ‘It suggests maybe we’re the front-runner, if somebody is taking an active interest in what a state governor is doing, particularly in light of the fact that we’re not the only one,’ Walker told Jon Fleischman of Breitbart, a conservative online publication. ‘Mitch Daniels in ’12 signed this, Rick Snyder, my friend in Michigan, signed it later that year. We are now the 25th state in America to have freedom to work.’” Perry wraps - Former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, wraps up his swing through the Granite State with stops today in Lancaster, Littleton, Meredith and Belmont.

Marco Rubio has recruited Rich Beeson, a veteran political operative and senior official on Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, to join his likely presidential campaign, according to two Republicans with knowledge of the move. Beeson is on tap to have a portfolio that includes political and field operations, and may serve as Rubio's deputy campaign manager should the Florida senator move forward officially with his widely expected bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.” Rand plants his flag in Texas - NRO: “Senator Rand Paul, R-Ky., picked off another digital operative from Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, as both freshman lawmakers gear up for expected presidential runs. Rachel Kania, who worked on Cruz’s primary campaign as statewide field director, hinted pretty strongly at Paul’s expected presidential campaign in her statement on joining his team. ‘As the newest member of Team Rand, I look forward to leveraging the latest in campaign technology to activate our energized volunteer base,’ Kania said.” [Texas Tribune: “Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is preparing to open the Austin outpost of his likely 2016 presidential campaign, a move set for Monday, according to his political action committee.] Howdy - On Sunday, Paul will give an interview at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Today, he will host a discussion on proposed changes to the criminal justice system today at Bowie State University in Maryland. Carly in the cornfields - Carly Fiorina will be in Iowa Saturday as the featured speaker at the E3 Women’s Conference sponsored by the Republican Party of Polk County. Christie super PAC up and running - USA Today: “Allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie launched a super PAC on Thursday to boost his potential White House bid. The creation of the super PAC, America Leads… Phil Cox, the new PAC’s director… a veteran GOP operative, has close ties Christie. He served as executive director of the Republican Governors Association (RGA) during Christie’s recent tenure as its chairman…Other key players in America Leads include Paige Hahn, a former RGA official, who will serve as finance director of the new super PAC; and Meredith O’Rourke, a GOP fundraiser in Florida, who will work as a fundraising consultant.” Hawks fly to S.C. - Gov. Bobby Jindal, R-La., former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., Ambassador John Bolton and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will be in South Carolina Saturday to attend the South Carolina National Security Action Summit. Faith matters - Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., and former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., will be in Florida Saturday for “The Awakening” conference. Carson leads book sales primary - Daily Caller: “If U.S. presidents were chosen by book sales, Ben Carson would soon occupy the Oval Office…Since 2012, at least eight potential 2016 presidential contenders have released books, with Carson, the former neurosurgeon turned conservative superstar, by far the best-selling author among them, according to numbers obtained from Nielsen Bookscan. Carson’s ‘One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America’s Future’ has sold a staggering 355,000 copies since its release in May 2014. It’s only real competition has been Hillary Clinton’s ‘Hard Choices,’ which has sold 264,000 copies since its release in June 2014…Mike Huckabee comes in third place in the ‘book sales primary’ with his ‘God, Guns, Grits and Gravy’ selling 53,000 copies since its recent release in January.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Is that tweet from a bot or not? As Twitter has grown to contain multitudes, it has become the home to millions of “bots,” (short for “robots”) that exist to endless vomit text into the inky void of the Internet. Some are malicious, some are mercantile and others seem to just be out for a good time. But could they be signifiers of something more? Writing at the New York Review of Books, James Gleick looks at how the chirping annoyances of social media are evolving: ‘Readers of Isaac Asimov’s many robot books, beginning with I, Robot in 1950, or viewers of Blade Runner, Ridley Scott’s 1982 movie based on Philip K. Dick’s story, might have expected the androids to make their entrance with more fanfare; but this is how the future really happens, so ordinary that we scarcely notice.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

With reports that the U.S. and other major powers of U.N. Security Council are quietly considering ending sanctions on Iran if a nuclear deal is struck, the one-upmanship battle between White House and Congress over the shape of any agreement with Tehran has reached new heights of confrontation. The move, the administration’s latest effort to by-pass Congress’s ability to undo a deal the president badly wants, has raised Republican hackles. Corker in it - AP: “In a letter, [Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.] said letting the U.N. consider such an agreement, while at the same time threatening to veto legislation that would allow Congress to vote on it, is a ‘direct affront’ to the American people and would undermine the role of Congress. In exchange for signing onto a deal aimed at keeping it from developing nuclear weapons, Iran seeks relief from sanctions, including those imposed by the U.S. executive branch, the United Nations and Congress. Corker has introduced legislation requiring any final agreement with Iran to be submitted to Congress for review before any sanctions imposed by Congress can be eased.” Outside game - David Drucker writes that despite blowback inside the Beltway, Republicans see a win in Senators’ letter to Iran: “Newspaper editorials rebuke its author, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark, and diplomatic professionals deride it as dangerously undermining foreign policy and national security. Even some Republicans worry that it takes opposition to Obama a step too far. But the letter should bolster Republicans’ standing with voters….Republican operatives say the GOP has to be careful not to cross the line between exercising their constitutional authority and diminishing the presidency. But those outside Washington said erring on the side of standing up for Israel and opposing ‘lunatic’ mullahs in Iran is a good place to be, politically” “I’m embarrassed for them. For them to address a letter to the Ayatollah, who they claim is our mortal enemy, and their basic argument to them is don’t deal with our president because you can’t trust him to follow through on an agreement, that’s close to unprecedented.” – President Obama in an interview with Vice. OBAMA SAYS ‘OPPRESSIVE’ POLICE FORCE DID NOT MERIT SHOOTING President Obama, who left the White House Thursday bound for the West Coast well after the news broke that two Ferguson, Mo., police officers had been shot and well before the evening news cycle, spoke his first words about the shooting in a taped interview on the late night comedy talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live”. Fox News: “Obama condemned the shooting… saying that though the city’s law enforcement practices were ‘oppressive and objectionable’, there was ‘no excuse’ for violence. … ‘Whoever fired those shots should not detract from the issue -- they are criminals, they need to be arrested,’ Obama said… Earlier Thursday, Obama had tweeted about the shooting, calling it ‘unacceptable.’” FOX NEWS REPORTING: ‘UNHOLY WAR – THE MARCH OF ISIS’ As ISIS cuts a swath across the Middle East with unparalleled brutality, how will the world respond--and will America lead, or follow?

Aaron Schock, R-Ill.] appears to have improperly accepted money from an outside group to cover travel expenses for a companion on a trip to India and failed to disclose it in a possible violation of House rules, according to a National Journal review of public records. Schock traveled to India on official business in August 2014, a trip during which he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Global Poverty Project, an advocacy organization that seeks to alleviate extreme poverty internationally, footed the bill, according to a spokesman for the group. But Schock’s photographer and videographer, Jonathon Link, traveled with him on the trip, which was well-documented on Schock's Instagram account…” GUESSING IT WASN’T ‘WHAT IT TAKES’ Fox News: “Johnathan Masters admits he’s not exactly the ideal running mate – he’s got a string of charges on his record, and pending court appearances on the calendar -- but he is absolutely puzzled by his latest arrest in Kenton County, Kentucky. Apparently, he was told by police on Wednesday he failed to return a library book from 11 years ago. ‘I am 100 percent not guilty,’ the 33-year-old lieutenant governor candidate told [Fox News] in an interview. ‘I don’t know what they are talking about. It could be anything.’ … When asked how he could possibly stay on the gubernatorial ticket under these circumstances, he said, ‘frankly, this is Kentucky where up is down and left is right. We’re working class folks. I’m an average working class man and I’ve had struggles. I know it’s not a picture perfect ideal. It’s not Camelot.’” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “I do want to say one thing about what the Obama people are saying in astonishment.

"ISLAMIST THREAT OVERSHADOWS OBAMA’S DOMESTIC SALES PITCH Just as President Obama is hitting the campaign trail to sell a reboot of his domestic policies ahead of next week’s State of the Union Address, the threat from Islamist militants is again crowding out his messages. Starting eight days ago with the deadly attack in Paris, the president has struggled to gain traction for his calls for more spending, higher taxes and new regulations. The Obama media strategy, on which its authors have been congratulating themselves at length in the political press, is to roll out the speech day after day to targeted geographic and demographic groups. This is not unlike what we saw last year when Islamists in Iraq and Syria destroyed the Democratic midterm communications strategy and focused national attention on concerns over the president’s foreign policy. The president’s campaign to avoid lame duck status looks similarly imperiled. Islamist killing fields in Nigeria - Fox News: “Amnesty International has released satellite images that it says show widespread destruction in two Nigerian towns attacked by Boko Haram last weekend. The international human rights organization says that the photos show the towns of Baga and Doron Baga in northeast Nigeria, before and after the attacks. The images were taken on Jan. 2 and Jan. 7 of this year. Boko Haram fighters seized a military base in Baga on Jan. 3 and, according to witnesses, killed hundreds of civilians in cold blood in the ensuing days. …Amnesty International calculates that 3,700 homes and other structures were demolished by the Islamic militants over the course of the attack.” [Fox News Poll: 64 percent of voters say the threat from Islamic extremists is increasing while 55 percent say President Obama is not prepared to do whatever it takes to defeat them.] ISIS gains territory - Fox News: “The Islamic State terror group reportedly has increased the amount of territory they control in Syria as the U.S.-led bombing campaign approaches its four-month anniversary. The Wall Street Journal, citing U.S. government and independent assessments, say that the Islamic State, commonly known as ISIS, has control of a large swath of northeastern Syria and is creeping toward key cities in the country's west, including Aleppo, a center of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad.” [Fox News Poll: 56 percent of voters disapprove of President Obama’s handling of ISIS and 57 percent disapprove of his overall foreign policy record.] Five Yemeni Islamists released from Gitmo - WashEx: “The Obama administration late Wednesday released five Yemeni al Qaeda fighters from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, sending four of them to Oman, which shares a border with Yemen. The move is likely to inflame GOP lawmakers who proposed Tuesday to bar further such releases, especially to Yemen, a country wracked by sectarian violence where the local al Qaeda affiliate has claimed credit for last week's deadly attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris. The four sent to Oman … were considered either medium-risk or high-risk detainees. A fifth, Ahmed Abdul Qadir, judged to be a medium risk, was sent to Estonia.” [Fox News Poll: 54 percent of voters think that President Obama has exceeded his authority when transferring suspects out of Guantanamo Bay while 59 percent feel that ISIS terrorists should be sent there.] THE JUDGE’S RULING: Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst JudgeAndrew Napolitano says that speech isn’t as free in the West as Paris protesters and their American supporters would have you believe. “And how hypocritical was it of the French government to claim it defends free speech! In France, you can go to jail if you publicly express hatred for a group whose members may be defined generally by characteristics of birth, such as gender, age, race, place of origin or religion…. What’s going on here? What’s going on in France, and what might be the future in America, is the government defending the speech with which it agrees and punishing the speech with which it disagrees.” [Fox News Poll: 35 percent of voters are very concerned that recent attacks will limit free speech in America.] OBAMA TO ADD LEAVE TIME FOR FED WORKERS, SEEK NEW RULES FOR PRIVATE SECTOR USA Today: “President Obama will call on Congress to require companies to give workers up to seven days of paid sick leave a year, a senior adviser said Wednesday. Obama will also take executive action to give at least six weeks of paid leave to federal employees after the birth or adoption of a child, Senior White House Adviser Valerie Jarrett said.” [Fox News Poll: While 60 percent of voters want to repeal all or parts of ObamaCare, 66 percent of voters agree that employer-paid health insurance should be guaranteed at 30 hours a week.] Calls for crackdown on natural gas - WSJ: “The Obama administration released proposed methane regulations set to go in effect in 2016 which include lowering levels of emissions by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels. These rules are designed to meet the commitment President Obama made in Beijing last November to lower greenhouse gases and would only impact new or modified locations.” Seeks new federal control of Internet - Des Moines Register: “Speaking in Cedar Falls, Iowa, a city that invested in broadband access as a municipal utility, President Obama unveiled new grant and loan opportunities for Internet service providers as well as ensuring the Federal Communications Commission has the regulatory power it needs to assist municipal utilities in providing internet access.” Conservative counterpoint - The Koch brothers-backed conservative group, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce is launching a new Plan for Economic Growth, a plan that focuses on fiscal responsibility and smaller government. “The first six years of the Obama administration have been defined by massive debt, broken promises, harmful regulations and an increasingly incompetent federal government,” said Freedom Partners spokesman James Davis. The three pillars of the agenda include tax and regulation reforms, repair ineffective government programs and restore a fiscally accountable government.

What they don’t understand (or understand well enough) is just how good. Yes, Republicans now control the Senate and have their largest majority in the House since World War II. But it’s downballot (way downballot) where the depth of the Republican victories over the past three elections truly reveal themselves -- and where the impact will be felt over the long term. In the past three elections, Republicans have gained 913 state legislative seats, according to calculations made by Larry Sabato at the University of Virginia…Now, there are more 7,000 state legislative seats in the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which makes that 913 number slightly less eye-popping. Still, the Democratic losses between 2010 and 2014 amount to 12 percent of all state legislative seats nationwide.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Meet Dwight McCarter, finder of lost souls.

The early national convention date (July 18 - 21 in Cleveland) is part of move by the RNC to condense the nominating process and allow the party’s eventual nominee to access general election funds sooner. The timing and number of debates, which the committee wants to limit, along with adoption of strict rules to make the primary season more orderly, are part of a strategy meant to avoid a repeat of 2012’s drawn-out primary schedule and seemingly endless debates. Most states have signaled a willingness to go along with the new RNC rules, though moving the convention to July could create problems for those with primaries falling within 45 of the July 18 convention start date. On the dais - While most of the recent press this week has centered on Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, potential 2016 hopefuls Ben Carson and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are scheduled speakers today at the RNC winter meeting at the seaside Hotel del Coronado. On Friday, Romney will deliver remarks aboard the nearby USS Midway aircraft carrier museum. Bush is not slated to attend the RNC meeting, but will be courting donors in southern California.

Steve King, Citizens United and Bob Vander Plaats of the conservative evangelical group, Family Leader. Romney nearly won Iowa’s caucuses, why wouldn’t he go if he’s seriously looking for feedback and support? Committeeman censured for toxic social media presence - Detroit Free Press: “The Republican National Committee’s top officers formally censured Michigan member Dave Agema [Wednesday] for what they called ‘harmful rhetoric’ and demanded his resignation. National Party Chairman Reince Priebus announced the censure of Agema, a former state representative from Grandville, who has been roundly criticized for remarks and posts on social media considered insensitive to gays, Muslims and blacks. ‘Agema’s history of harmful and offensive rhetoric has no place in our party, which is why the RNC Executive Committee acted in the swiftest way possible to avoid giving him a platform,’ Priebus said [Wednesday night] as the RNC's Winter Meeting was set to get under way outside San Diego.” SANTORUM’S MONEY MAN READY TO FUND ANOTHER RUN WaPo: “Foster Friess, a wealthy conservative donor whose funds propelled Rick Santorum’s 2012 presidential campaign, will host a private gathering in Scottsdale, Ariz., this weekend to rally support behind Santorum’s potential 2016 bid. A group of Republican business executives, as well as GOP consultants from South Carolina and Iowa, are scheduled to have conversations with Santorum about his strategy and with Friess about financing a national political operation. … In an e-mail exchange last week with The Washington Post, Friess said that 20 Republican governors invited him to their inaugural celebrations this month, including a potential Santorum rival, Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.).But, he added, ‘I am clearly in the Santorum camp.’” [Cold shoulders - As Santorum builds out his campaign, he will likely be doing so without his trademark sweater vest from 2012, reports Fox News colleague Serafin Gomez.] Cruz not shy about 2016 - The [Harrisburg] Patriot News: “For an afternoon the lobby at the Hershey Lodge resembled a corridor at the U.S. Capitol. Scores of congressmen, some in obligatory dark suits, others sporting far more casual attire, filed in throughout Wednesday afternoon to check in for a two-day retreat billed as part policy and strategy generating, part bonding. Unlike Congress, though, these officials were only Republicans…Sporting an unbuttoned sheepskin jacket and a green button-down shirt, Sen. Ted Cruz [R-Texas] arrived alone and made a beeline for the check-in line. The Texas conservative, who was swept into Congress by the tea party in 2012, didn't hesitate when answering a question about a possible bid for the 2016 presidential ticket: ‘I'm looking at it very seriously. I expect the field will form in the next several months. By June we should have a good picture of who is running.’” Rand stays swinging - New Hampshire Journal: “[Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.,] testing the proverbial waters in first-primary state New Hampshire [Wednesday] …sharply portrayed [Mitt Romney] and [Jeb Bush] as relics of an outdated version of the GOP that now must move ahead and broaden its base with fresh ideas, and fresh faces…‘I think we do need somebody and something new,’ Paul said…He said Republicans must figure out how to attract those voters to the GOP, ‘and I think that’s going to take a new approach, a fresh approach.’ Paul said Romney and Bush ‘occupy the same space and are competing somewhat for the same voters – people who want something that is safe, something that is sort of historical. But even people who are looking for ‘safe’ realize that ‘safe’ hasn’t won in the past.’ But overall, he reiterated about Romney and Bush, ‘the more the merrier.’” Crowded by Jeb and Mitt, Christie looks to exude calm - NYT:“Amid the most aggressive, early and elbows-out jockeying for a presidential nomination in a generation, a contender known for his mercurial and impulsive style is delivering a surprising message to his top supporters and donors: Relax. There is no great rush to wade into the Republican primary, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey assures them. There’s enough money to go around, his advisers and allies explain.” FOMO APPARENTLY DOESN’T APPLY TO VOTING WaPo: “Elections keep getting older, but the young voters stay the same age. And those young voters, by and large, keep on not voting. There’s a lot of benefit to getting younger voters involved in campaigns: they’re often tireless volunteers, and having a strong advocate in a home with regular voters certainly doesn’t hurt. But 18- to 24-year-olds are often among the smallest percentage of the electorate… The age of Boomer-controlled politics is fading. Gen Xers are ascendant. #Millennials, the generation that’s done so much to shape our culture, have largely yet to appear on the political scene.” AT LEAST THE ACLU COULDN’T COMPLAIN Two new rugs at the Pinellas County, Fla. Sheriff’s Office administration building sure looked nice while they lasted. WFTS reports that the $500 bright green rugs emblazoned with the sheriff’s emblem were placed at the front entrance several weeks ago. But just this week, one astute deputy working security detail at the building discovered an error. Rather than saying, “In God We Trust,” the rugs actually said “In Dog We Trust.” The manufacturer, American Floor Mats, took responsibility for the error and is currently working on replacement rugs for the sheriff’s office according to a spokesperson. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “The way the administration is always focused on what you call core al Qaeda, as if you can ignore all the other elements, the other scattered Islamist groups around the world and you denigrate them as jayvee, that just doesn’t wash anymore. It just, it doesn’t make any difference.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here. Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"At last Thursday's breakfast, following a powerful personal salvation talk by NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Darrell Waltrip, President Obama counseled the world by linking radical Islam to the Crusades of the 11th century and the Inquisition of the 15th century. He said Christians shouldn't get on their ""high horse"" about fanaticism, asserting that people acting ""in Christ's name"" used religion to justify slavery and Jim Crow laws.

"OBAMA’S COMEBACK CUT SHORT Just a few weeks ago, the sun was shining again in Obamaland. The economy was snapping out of its six-year funk, thanks in large part to cheap gasoline, liberals were pumped up about executive action on immigration, no one else had died of Ebola and the press and public were swooning over Cuba. A conventional wisdom that had concluded just a month prior that President Obama was a failure, scampered right past “comeback kid” and ran all the way to “conquering hero.” The seeming conclusion was that if only the country could have seen January, November would have looked completely different. And then everything started to fall apart overseas again. [AP: “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned trip to Washington in March is kicking up a diplomatic dust storm in the nation's capital. On Thursday, the White House said President Barack Obama would not meet the prime minister when he comes to the U.S. to address a joint session of Congress.] Things fall apart - Starting with the audacious raid on a Paris magazine in broad daylight by Islamist militants and continuing through horrifying headlines today about the collapse of the Western client government in Islamist-benighted Yemen, the strong sense is that the struggle between Islamists and the West has taken a strong turn for the worse. News that the king of America’s problematic but indispensable ally, Saudi Arabia, had died stoked new fears about unrest in the region. The mortal enemies of the House of Saud, the Shi’a theocrats of Iran, are probing for weakness everywhere and cutting new military deals with yet another hostile power, Russia. And as for the U.S.-led effort to contain the barbarous wannabe caliphs of ISIS, it would appear that things are getting worse, not better. [“This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner's forces on the ground. This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years.” –President Obama statement on ISIS on September 10, 2014] Rerun - We have seen this movie before. In the summer of last year, the establishment press, dreeing their coverage of the Republican romp to come, saw a glimmer of hope for Democrats to at least hold the Senate. The economy was puttering more than sputtering and Democrats were pushing an audacious plan to sink Republicans in a sea of campaign cash and attack ads. But the almost tragicomic handling of an unraveling world scene, highlighted best by the president’s ill-conceived round of golf following a press conference at which he professed to be “heartbroken” by the beheading of an American by ISIS, ended those dreams of a blue November. And here we are again. Green shoots of hope for Democrats mowed down by public distrust of the president’s foreign policy and judgment. This time it was the bungling of the unity march in Paris that started the cycle rather than a round of golf, but the political outcome will be the same. [Power Play - Republican strategist Ed Pozzuoli and liberal talk radio star Garland Nixon join Power Play host Chris Stirewalt to discuss the president’s problem selling his Iran plan and other foreign policy woes. WATCH HERE.] Long shadows - But the one who should be most worried is not the current president, but rather the woman who Democrats believe will succeed him. Hillary Clinton will have little trouble ditching domestic policies from this administration. But on foreign policy, which was in her care for the president’s first term, there will be no escape. “This is a president who the other night talked about turning the page, who talked about the shadow of crisis having passed. I think any of us who watched what's happened around the world not just the last 48 hours but the last few weeks, in France… Any time you have freedom loving people anywhere around the world who are under attack by radical Islamic terrorists, it's a threat to all of us.” – Gov.

The two men's camps are in disagreement about the documentary, which the director has been making for HBO, according to a New York Times report. Sources told The Times Clinton wanted more control over the questions asked and the final product than the director wanted to allow. Portions of the film, which was announced in December 2012, have been shot over the past two years…According to Times sources, Clinton sought to omit questions that could potentially damage his wife Hilary Clinton’s reputation as the 2016 presidential election nears and questions of her candidacy loom.” Power play: Hillary, party of one - President Obama has his political machine, Hillary Clinton has hers.

The ability to switch between languages is something researchers call the bilingual advantage, creating an agile and flexible mind. Psychologist Ellen Bialystok found that bilinguals had enhanced executive control, a common thread in improved academic performance. Bialystok also found another advantage, bilingualism showed a benefit to fight back aging in the brain. Multilingual people seem to resist the effects of dementia far better than monolinguals do. Regardless of the language or activity, simply keeping the brain actively engaged gives it a higher capacity to continue functioning. And so while the mental advantages may not be exactly what researchers thought, they could be far outweighed by the physical ones. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Top contenders will audition at dueling events, one hosted by social conservatives and another from the libertarian wing of the party. The landscape stretches from Iowa to California and the stakes are sky high not only for the Sixteeners, but for the two power centers themselves and their ability to coalesce behind a conservative candidate to challenge (or absorb) the party’s establishment wing.

"THE FULL ACKBAR: RIGHT WARNS OBAMA WAR PLAN IS A TRAP In a blistering column, influential conservative columnist Matthew Continetti calls President Obama’s request for congressional authorization for the ongoing war in Iraq and Syria a “trap” and says he would “happily” vote it down. “If the threat of ISIS is as dire as the president says it is in the preamble of his resolution,” Continetti writes, “then not only does the president already have the authority to strike granted to him by Article II of the Constitution and the 2001 and 2002 war resolutions, he also should not cavil or hesitate in unleashing every means at his disposal to confront and defeat the enemy.” Continetti goes on to say, “I also cannot help thinking that the presidential request is little more than a trap, a bone thrown in the direction of the cloakroom to distract from the collapse of America’s position in the Middle East and the approaching deadline for nuclear talks with Iran. How better to provoke infighting among both Republicans and Democrats, to switch the debate from sanctions against Iran to ‘Rand Paul versus Marco Rubio for the soul of the GOP,’ than to start a debate over presidential war powers as the war is going on.”","474","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/full-ackbar-right-warns-obama-war-plan-is-trap.html"

"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Relatively little is known about the history of the peoples of the British Isles prior to the arrival of Roman legions in the 1st Century, A.D. But one durable belief is that the more placid peoples of the south who would live under Roman rule were a breed apart from the wild, savage tribes to the north, known to the Romans as Picts. But a new book from Benjamin Hudson, a professor of history and medieval studies at Penn State, is turning that discussion around. While Roman history focuses on the Picts as uncivilized enemies as the Romans began to try to expand the empire’s boundaries into northern England, Hudson’s book argues that “they weren't different, they were merely Britons that the Romans didn't conquer.” While Hudson’s research shows a glimpse of life and culture without the Roman influence, it also makes the case that the bias of Roman historians created a false delineation between residents of the south and residents of the north prior to their arrival.","485","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/full-ackbar-right-warns-obama-war-plan-is-trap.html"

"GOP CONFIDENCE GROWS WHILE DEMS GET JITTERS Fox News polling guru Dana Blanton writes: “…by a 10-point margin, more Republicans are looking forward to the 2016 campaign than dreading it. That’s the opposite of how they felt about the start of the 2012 campaign in 2011. At that time, they were more likely to say they were dreading the race by 10 points. The poll finds the same reversal of sentiment among Democrats. They were looking forward to the 2012 campaign by 8 points, while now they say they are dreading the start of the 2016 campaign by 5 points. Republicans might be looking forward to 2016 because they are more confident about their party’s chances. Fully 78 percent of Republicans think the GOP candidate is going to win the next presidential election, while just 63 percent of Democrats feel that way about their party’s candidate. The results are almost the same when the hypothetical race is between a generic Republican and Democrat Hillary Clinton: 76 percent of Republicans say their candidate will win, while 67 percent of Democrats think Clinton will prevail.”","488","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/13/full-ackbar-right-warns-obama-war-plan-is-trap.html"

"BIDEN WARNS HILLARY: ‘I HAVEN’T MADE UP MY MIND’ Detroit News: “Vice President Joe Biden said he had not made a decision on whether he will run for president… Biden made the statement in a roundtable discussion with reporters at the White House Monday including The Detroit News a day after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced her run for the Democratic nomination. He said he has plenty of time to decide. ‘I haven’t made up my mind on that. I have plenty of time to do that, in my view,’ Biden said. ‘If I am wrong, I’m dead wrong, but there’s a lot the president and I care about that has to get done in the next two, three months and when you run for president you’ve got to run for president — and I’m not ready to do that — if I am ever going to be ready to do that.’” [The vice president speaks at a symposium for University of Notre Dame students in Washington, D.C. today.] “It’s a little early for endorsements since [Hillary Clinton] just announced yesterday.

The ad, called “Trustworthy?” concludes with a narrator voiceover saying, “Less than half say Mrs. Clinton is honest and trustworthy” and Clinton is heard saying, “I think I’m probably the most transparent person in public life.” Ed Henry wants to know: When does Hillary meet the press? - “Monticello, IOWA -- Will Hillary Clinton start taking any actual questions from reporters – as well as voters – today? So far Clinton’s nascent presidential campaign has only been serving up tiny morsels about her road trip to this tiny hamlet in the eastern portion of the Hawkeye State. … So we have learned that when she stopped in Pittsburgh Sunday night, Clinton ordered room service and -- as luck would have it -- the menu had a section labeled Scooby snacks. (Perhaps a hotel worker with a silly sense of humor). Then of course there was Monday’s stop at a Chipotle south of Toledo. Again, we learned she had a chicken burrito bowl (with black beans and some guac). But the odd photo of surveillance video showing the candidate behind dark sunglasses showed no actual interaction with voters. … The van finally made it to an undisclosed location here in Iowa on Tuesday, yet still no sign of an interview or press availability. Remember just yesterday Marco Rubio entered and did his tour of Fox’s Sean Hannity, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and NPR’s Steve Inskeep. … Nobody has been able to say the same to Clinton since she has not yet strapped on a helmet for an interview. Her aides say they will come later, for now she will focus on voters with her first event today with students and educators at a community college. For now, the press corps is getting tiny morsels about her snacks. But we are getting a little, well, hungry.” – Ed Henry. Read the whole dispatch here. ‘Relentlessly, insultingly vapid’ - WaPo’s Ruth Marcus was not a fan of Clinton’s video introduction: “For one, the video was relentlessly, insultingly vapid – a Verizon commercial without the substance. ‘Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top,’ Clinton said in what passed for a meaty message. ‘Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.’ Seriously, this makes Ronald Reagan’s gauzy ‘It’s Morning Again in America’ commercial look like a Brookings Institution seminar on economic policy.” DOC FIX LOOKING ILL The Hill: “The Senate is poised to vote Tuesday on a handful of amendments to a roughly $200 billion Medicare deal, according to three people familiar with the negotiations.

Reid did not specify what proposals the amendments would contain. But two people familiar with the talks, including a Senate Democratic aide, said Democrats want a four-year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the removal of abortion-related language known as the Hyde Amendment and a repeal of the Medicare therapy cap.” [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel reports live from Capitol Hill] As tax day nears, Congress tells IRS to ‘stand down’ - The Hill: “Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) warned the IRS on Monday to stand down from any efforts to broaden out new rules governing social welfare groups. Two days ahead of Tax Day, Hatch told the IRS commissioner, John Koskinen, that any such move would undercut the agency’s efforts to regain the taxpayers’ trust. Koskinen took over the agency after the IRS acknowledged singling out Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status, a controversy that still rages almost two years later and caused many senior IRS officials to lose their jobs.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… It was 150 years ago today, in a moment that would come to be seen as a tragedy for North and South, John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, entered President Abraham Lincoln box in Ford’s Theater and killed the president with a single shot to the head. With a nod to the get-to-the-news fast gospel of today’s media, the Washington Post contrasts how several 19th century publications reported the assassination, one of the infamous moments in American history. From the AP’s buried lead – readers learned that the play Lincoln was watching was a crowd-pleaser before they were informed that “the President had been shot” and his fatal condition was only revealed at the end of the write-up – to Washington Star’s positioning the assassination story next to an ad for “an Elixir of Love,” the Post shows how the media in a different era possessed its share of reportorial foibles.

"END OF EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS CREDITED FOR JOB SURGE WashEx: “Sixty percent of job creation in 2014 was caused by the expiration of unemployment benefits, according to a new working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. In late 2013, a standoff between Republicans and Democrats led to the abrupt expiration of long-term unemployment benefits. Democrats warned that the expiration would have disastrous ramifications, but Republicans had long argued that allowing Americans to collect unemployment benefits for an indefinite period of time provided a disincentive for them to work. The new working paper found that the expiration of benefits was responsible for the creation of over 1.8 million jobs. Nearly 1 million of those jobs were created by workers who would have otherwise stayed out of the labor force if unemployment benefits had been extended. Overall, almost 3 million jobs were created in 2014.” [In the latest Gallup poll, President Obama’s approval rating has hit 50 percent for the first time since June 2013.] GOP LEADERS PULL BORDER BILL, BLAME BLIZZARD National Journal: “…on Capitol Hill, the inclement weather gave Republican leaders a chance to buy time to gather support for a controversial border security bill. The bill, meant to be considered on the House floor Wednesday, was pulled from the schedule Monday, a decision that leadership sources said was made because of the bad weather and the short week. House votes were cancelled Monday evening as members brace for the storm, and the House will recess Wednesday so Democrats can attend their annual retreat in Philadelphia. The measure, authored by Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, was facing opposition from conservatives…It is unclear when the bill will come back to the House floor. Current funding for DHS is scheduled to run out Feb. 28, so a significant showdown between Obama and Republicans on immigration is expected before then.” Dems try to head off Iran sanctions - The Hill: “A pair of Democratic senators on Monday introduced a resolution in support of allowing nuclear negotiations with Iran to conclude before the passage of further sanctions. The resolution from Sens. Dianne Feinstein [D-Calif.] and Chris Murphy [D-Conn.] states that the Senate is prepared to consider additional sanctions against Iran if the talks fail, as opposed to a bill that will be considered by the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, which would automatically impose sanctions if the talks fail. ‘This resolution represents a different approach than that of the sanctions bill pending in the Senate Banking Committee,’ a statement from Feinstein's office said. That bill, co-authored by Sens. Mark Kirk [R-Ill.] and Robert Menendez [D-N.J.] would impose new sanctions against Iran if the talks failed by a deadline of June 30 and no earlier than July 6. It also includes a presidential waiver if a deal is near. The White House opposes the bill and says it could derail the talks to roll back Iran's nuclear program.” [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel has the latest on Iran sanctions from Capitol Hill.] Bickering continues over Benghazi committee rules - Fox News: “The chairman of the House select committee investigating the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya defended himself against criticism from Democrats that he had excluded them from meetings with witnesses.” DCCC $10 million in the hole - Roll Call: “The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee will report raising more than $206 million during the 2014 cycle, a record total, according to a committee aide. The DCCC will start the 2016 cycle $10 million in debt. Also per the aide, that’s less than the $13.5 million in arrears the committee posted following the 2012 cycle. The committee will report the totals in its year-end fundraising report, which includes new filings from Nov. 25 through Dec. 31.

Tammy Baldwin [D-Wis.] abruptly ousted one of her top state staffers late last week. Marquette Baylor, deputy state director for Baldwin and chief of her Milwaukee office, was let go on Thursday without explanation. Baylor has been offered a cash payout as part of a severance package if the former aide agrees to keep her lips zipped. ‘It looks like they're trying to pin the blame on her,’ a source said of Baylor's dismissal by Baldwin. But Ryan Hon, a former Tomah VA employee who has acted as a whistle-blower, said Sunday that Baylor is just one of several Baldwin staffers who mishandled the matter and should be let go. He said he talked with Baylor for two hours in late November about the problems at the Tomah medical center and that the Baldwin aide discouraged him from going public with his concerns, saying that doing so might get her and others fired.” [The Department of Veterans Affairs has launched the first part of an agency wide overhaul to better assist veterans receive their benefits.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... 50 years ago today, the Shelby GT 350 made its debut.

"RULE OF LAW QUESTIONS LOOM FOR HOLDER REPLACEMENT The most important legacy Eric Holder will likely leave as attorney general seems to be his willingness to insulate President Obama from politically damaging issues. The main question today for Holder’s designated successor, U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, is whether she will reassert the often-vaunted but seldom-seen independence of the office. Lynch is not controversial, but the agency and its current leader certainly are. That’s where you can expect to see fireworks in her confirmation hearing today. [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel has the latest on Lynch’s nomination live from Capitol Hill.] As Holder leaves office, he leaves his all-but-certain successor with a host of unresolved controversies, including IRS targeting, Fast and Furious, reporter snooping and the legitimacy of the president's executive actions. Senate Republicans have once chance to pin down Lynch on these hot bottom issues and achieve what conservatives call a “restoration” of the office to its traditional role. What she says today will help define the parameters of the administration’s legal pioneering for the closing days of the Obama era. HOUSE PLANS NEW LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMA’S IMMIGRATION ORDERS The Hill: “The House is taking action to sue President Obama over his executive actions that gave legal status to millions of illegal immigrants. Speaker John Boehner [R-Ohio] apprised House Republicans of the plan, which is still being finalized, during the weekly conference meeting Tuesday morning. ‘We are finalizing a plan to authorize litigation on this issue, one we believe gives us the best chance of success,’ Boehner told members, according to a source in the room. Under the emerging plan, members would vote on a resolution authorizing the House to take various legal actions. Options could include filing a new lawsuit against the president or joining the states' lawsuit against the executive action. Last year, the House voted to sue Obama over his use of executive actions delaying the healthcare law's employer mandate, which requires businesses with 50 or more full-time workers to provide insurance. Boehner's announcement comes a day after GOP leadership pulled a controversial border security bill from the floor.” [Watch Fox: Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, sits down for an exclusive interview on “Special Report with Bret Baier” tonight at 6PM ET.] Obama backs off plan to tax college savings - Fox News: “President Obama has dropped his plan to end tax breaks for popular college savings accounts known as 529s, sources told Fox News on Tuesday. The decision comes in the wake of stern criticism from Republicans and pleas from top Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to drop the plan…Administration officials had claimed last week that they were going after the 529 accounts because they unfairly benefit high-income people. Under the proposed change, Americans eventually would have had to pay taxes on the earnings when they were withdrawn. A White House official told Fox News late Tuesday afternoon that the 529 provision was a ‘very small component’ of Obama's plan to cut taxes for the middle class. ‘Given it has become such a distraction, we’re not going to ask Congress to pass the 529 provision so that they can instead focus on delivering a larger package of education tax relief that has bipartisan support, as well as the President’s broader package of tax relief for childcare and working families,’ the official said.” [Keystone cops - National Journal: “As a bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline creeps closer to the finish line, the Senate will consider language on liquefied natural gas exports, campaign finance reform and climate change as part of a massive vote series. The Senate will vote on 18 amendments [today] starting at 2:30 p.m. as party leaders push to finish up the bill -- which would approve the controversial Alberta-to-Gulf-Coast oil sands pipeline -- before the end of the week.”] [The confirmation hearing for Defense Secretary nominee Ashton Carter is scheduled for February 4.] RNC REBOOTS DIGITAL TEAM Politico: “Chuck DeFeo, the RNC deputy chief of staff who engineered a $100 million tech overhaul … is set to join i360, a data and analytical powerhouse that will receive part of an $889 million cash infusion from the Koch Brothers and other conservative megadonors to help elect Republicans in 2016. Also, former Facebook engineer Andrew Barkett is giving up his title as the RNC’s chief technology officer…. Replacing DeFeo and Barkett are a mix of veteran GOP tech specialists.

Using www.randomtextgenerator.com, Shrime came up with an article, “Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs?” Over two weeks, he submitted it to 37 journals and has been accepted by 17 thus far, none have published it without the $500 “processing fee.” Despite sounding like legitimate medical journals, upon further investigation, Shrime found that many had suspicious addresses including one that housed a strip club. Researchers in developing countries seem to be the target of this scam which angers Shrime, who says, “They’re preying on people who aren’t able to get into the mainstream medical journals because they come from a university that nobody recognizes or they have some other scientific disadvantage.” For those with concerns, the National Library of Medicine creates an approved list of medical journals called PubMed.

Romney will be speaking in a packed, 1,000-seat hall at Mississippi State University, with organizers adding an overflow room to handle additional demand. Mississippi, the nation’s poorest state, is an appropriate venue for Romney to deliver a framing speech since the candidate has vowed to focus on the issue of poverty – as well as global warming and education – if he proceeds with another run. But it’s also significant because it is where his top political adviser, Stuart Stevens, staged a goal-line stand to save Republican Sen.

"[Making hay - NYT: “Mitt Romney … will be inducted into the elite [Alfalfa Club] on Saturday at their annual Washington dinner, according to a member…”] Game changer? - Working for Cochran, Stevens, with the help of a coalition of establishment GOP forces, delivered a surprise win for the embattled incumbent, who has held the seat since 1978. Notable was that rather than wooing the state’s GOP electorate, Cochran’s campaign altered it by bringing traditionally Democratic voters, especially African Americans, out to vote in the runoff. Could Romney, who is trying to shake his reputation as ideologically accommodating, follow a similar strategy? Thad Cochran ran and won as a moderate in a conservative state. Romney might be hoping to do the same in a conservative national party. It would be a long shot, perhaps. But in a crowded field, broad appeal will be less valuable than durable core support. ‘Determined to rebrand himself as authentic’ - WaPo: “If he runs again in 2016, Romney is determined to rebrand himself as authentic, warts and all, and central to that mission is making public what for so long he kept private. He rarely discussed his religious beliefs and practices in his failed 2008 and 2012 races, often confronting suspicion and bigotry with silence as his political consultants urged him to play down his Mormonism.” Love it or list it? - Boston Globe: “Two years ago, Mitt Romney … simultaneously began building two multimillion-dollar homes, one [in La Jolla, Calif.] on the Pacific Ocean and another outside Salt Lake City. He also bought a third, a slopeside ski chalet in Park City, Utah…. He is taking steps to shed some of his property, including retaining a broker who is currently showing the La Jolla home to potential buyers, according to a Romney aide.”","610","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/28/rule-law-questions-loom-for-holder-replacement.html"
"POWER PLAY: 2016 GOP POWER INDEX IN 90 SECONDS No doubt about it, the race is on and it’s time for your Fox News First 2016 GOP Power Index. From Mitt to Jeb and Rand to Ben, Chris Stirewalt breaks down the rundown of the top Republican contenders with their eye on a White House bid. WATCH HERE. Jeb floated plan to deport millions of visa overstays - Tampa Bay Times: “During [Jeb Bush’s] speech before the National Automobile Dealers Association, Bush seemed to be trying to find the sweet spot on immigration. Noting how many people come to the U.S. with valid visas but never go home, Bush had this response: ‘We ought to be able to find where they are and politely ask them to leave.’” Big talk - Byron York writes: “Bush seemed to propose an organized effort to deport millions of illegal immigrants. If Bush actually did what he appeared to say should be done, he would deport as many illegal immigrants from the United States as President Obama has legalized with his unilateral executive action. ‘A great nation needs to control its border,’ Bush told the audience in San Francisco, ‘not just at the border, which is hugely important, but also the 40 percent of the people that have come here illegally with a legal visa and overstayed their bounds. We ought to be able to figure out where they are and politely ask them to leave.’ Politely ask them to leave? The phrasing won't win him much support from law-and-order Republicans, but, Bush appeared to suggest that U.S. authorities track down and deport more than four million people out of the total 11-plus million who are in the country illegally.” Iowa kingmaker declares Walker, Cruz winners of weekend cattle call - Bloomberg: “[Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa] had intended to watch the speakers, and watch how the audience reacted. ‘Part of this is a measure of the interpretations of talking to a good number of people that are highly invested in this,’ he said. ‘We sat around Saturday night and chewed the fat.’ And who won? ‘Basically, the press reports I read were mostly accurate in their analysis,’ said King. ‘I think [Texas Senator] Ted Cruz had the highest bar to reach, and I think he cleared that bar. I don't know how much greater than expectations it was, but he at least met and then exceeded expectations. I'm confident that he did for the people who had not heard him speak before.’ Who else performed above expectations? ‘Probably the person who helped himself the most would be Scott Walker,’ said King. ‘The bar wasn't as high, and he gave a good speech. He connected with the audience in a good, constructive way.’” Walker gets his own super group - Fox News: “Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Tuesday that he was ‘very interested’ in a possible run for president on 2016, hours after he announced the launch of a new political committee…Walker, who gave a well-received speech to a forum of conservative voters in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday, set up the committee ‘Our American Revival’ on Jan. 16. A new website for the so-called 527 organization, which will help him get his message out as he works toward building his political clout, went live Tuesday morning.” Hope springs in Rubio’s world - Bloomberg: “[Sen. Marco Rubio’s] backers are sounding increasingly optimistic about the future…That vision also includes what his potential presidential campaign would look like, and Rubio told about 30 core supporters that he would decide by the spring about whether to run for president, according to two Republicans who attended Saturday's meeting and agreed to speak about it on the condition of anonymity.” Langone looks to build out Christie campaign - WSJ: “Ken Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot Inc. and a major Republican donor, is anxious about the state of the U.S. these days and he thinks he knows who can fix it: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie . Mr. Langone has become one of the most visible backers of Mr. Christie’s possible run for president in 2016, and he is now tapping his extensive network of fellow donors to try to line up financial support…Mr. Langone is separately reaching out to his network for a series of private events for potential supporters to get to know Mr. Christie, with the first dinner set for New York City on Wednesday. The gatherings are informal meetings, not fundraisers, Mr. Langone said.” Not an early primary state - Mike Huckabee continues his book tour for “God, Guns, Grits and Gravy” with three stops in North Carolina today. Carson: ‘My voice is the voice of the people, and the people have something to say’ - [Baton Rouge] Advocate: “Dr. Ben Carson, a rising star on the national political scene who is often mentioned among the GOP’s presidential prospects for 2016, won over Louisiana business leaders with a speech Tuesday that called for less government regulation, lower taxes and an alternative to the federal Affordable Care Act. …He said he thought the buzz would die down well before the 2016 field started to form. ‘It just kept building and building,’ Carson said. ‘My voice is the voice of the people, and the people have something to say.’” Pence takes gamble on Medicaid plan - Indianapolis Star: “After months of wrangling between Gov. Mike Pence and the Obama administration, Indiana won approval to expand its own brand of Medicaid that injects personal responsibility into the healthcare program for the poor. About 350,000 low-income Hoosiers who lack insurance could benefit from the program, whose approved expansion was announced Tuesday, the day enrollment began. Coverage could start as early as Feb. 1. Pence said the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, a revamped version of a program started by then-Gov. Mitch Daniels, goes beyond standard Medicaid expansion by requiring that participants contribute to the cost of their care…. [Pence said] ‘HIP 2.0 is not intended to be a long-term entitlement program. It's intended to be a safety net that aligns incentives with human aspirations.’” Perry prosecution proceeding - AP: “A Texas judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss a felony abuse-of-power case against former Gov. Rick Perry on constitutional grounds, ruling that criminal charges against the possible 2016 presidential candidate should stand.” BENGHAZI PANEL DEM: HILLARY READY TO TESTIFY The Hill: “Hillary Clinton is willing to testify before the House Select Committee that is investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, according to the panel’s top Democrat. Rep. Elijah Cummings [D-Md.] on Tuesday said he has spoken to Clinton about the possibility of testifying at the request of Rep. Trey Gowdy [R-S.C.], the panel’s Republican chairman, and she ‘did not hesitate for one second.’ ‘She said ... I’ll do it, period,’ Cummings said after the committee's third hearing. Cummings said Clinton, who was secretary of State at the time of the Benghazi attacks, indicated to him last year that she ‘wanted to come in December’ to testify but could also come in January. ‘The fact is that she was very clear,’ Cummings said.” [Ed note: The question is whether House Democrats will have more incentive to cut and run from the committee since doing so would create the perfect excuse for Hillary to demur.] Up to Obama to push Hillary leftward - National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar notes: “It’s a gamble that will determine whether his landmark legislation will remain law, or be rolled back by a new Republican president….[H]e’s boxed her into a corner. [Clinton] can’t afford to publicly break with a president whose fortunes align closely with hers. Yet she’s undoubtedly aware that her odds of winning the Democratic nomination are very strong, and moving away from the center won't help her in a general election….Team Clinton continues to be anxious about whether [Elizabeth Warren] jumps into the race, forcing Clinton to take positions to the left of the political sweet spot. She's focused on the wrong Democrat. For all the hype, Warren is unlikely to run and won't be the Democrat pushing Clinton to the left. It will be Obama himself.” [Warren lies low - “Sen. Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.] is not expected to speak at the Congressional Progressive Caucus retreat in Philadelphia next month,” Politico reports. “A leading progressive voice in Congress, the Massachusetts senator was invited to keynote the issues retreat for the 70-person liberal caucus for House and Senate members.”] Forbidden fruit - While the White House wasn’t always The Garden of Eden for the Clintons, former President Bill Clinton came up with biblical nickname for himself were he and Hillary were to move back in 2017. USA Today: “Talk show host Rachael Ray asked Clinton what he would be called if he returns to the White House as the spouse of the first female president. His suggestion? ‘Adam’ — as in the first man. “If a woman became president … I could be called Adam. I don’t know,” Clinton told Ray…“We’re joking about this, but it’s a serious decision. Serious decision for Hillary, serious decision for the country and the world.”…For the record, Hillary Clinton has suggested her husband’s title if they return to the White House would be ‘first man’ or ‘first mate.’” WHAT’S WORSE THAN A FAKE BLIZZARD? While they can’t claim they survived the great Blizzard of 2015, five people endured the Facebook-apocalypse that hit the site for about an hour early Tuesday morning. CBS 5 in San Francisco reports that emergency dispatchers received five calls from East Bay residents to report the site outage. A dispatcher posted this reminder on a local blog, “We have nothing to do with Facebook and when Facebook isn’t working, it’s not an emergency. Our lines are dedicated to handle life and death calls, and even though Facebook is important to a lot of people, it’s not a matter of life and death when it stops working.” The anonymous dispatcher wrote that one of the social-media-starved callers called back to say the dispatcher was rude when explaining that the situation was in fact not a life threatening emergency. Facebook blames the outage on an internal glitch and not a third party attack. For future reference visit this site to find out the latest updates and resolutions the next time the site goes down.

"YOLO! CLINTONS TO KEEP TAKING FOREIGN FUNDS In a move that is either reckless or clueless, Hillary Clinton’s family foundation has decided to continue accepting money from foreign governments and oligarchs, despite the practice having been revealed in a series of damning reports. The organization announced that it might reconsider “should Secretary Clinton decide to run for office,” which is a pretty funny thing to say about a woman who is hiring staff, picking out a headquarters and who has been seeking the highest office in the land for the better part of a decade. If there were some concern about the ethics of what is clearly a shady practice, wouldn’t the correct answer be to stop now and consider resuming if Clinton opts not to run?","615","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/20/yolo-clintons-to-keep-taking-foreign-funds.html"
"Won’t back down - The NYT Editorial Page beseeches the Democratic frontrunner to stop the madness, but as she did in her insistence that she was “dead broke” after leaving the White House, she persists despite the pleas of her supporters. The fact that Clinton would place so much ethical emphasis on the arbitrary, functionally nonexistent line between preparing for a presidential run and running for president should be a matter of deep concern for Democrats who have lived through the horrors of defending the Clintons’ fungible financial rules for decades. Scorcher - Matthew Continetti is never so wicked nor so good as when he is fricasseeing the Clintons’ world of wealth and privilege. And today, he is really cooking on the front burner: “What I love about this statement is its flip shamelessness, the way in which its airy sentimental public relations gobbledygook is both a denial of what is obviously a corrupt practice and an implicit endorsement of it. I do not doubt for a moment that the Clinton flack who led the email chain that came up with this blistering retort to the Journal is indeed ‘grateful’ for every single one of the donations that foreign governments are making to his organization, because life in Manhattan and North Caldwell, New Jersey, is very expensive…” Warren demurs - Boston Herald: “Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who huddled with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton just weeks ago, repeatedly ducked questions about whether she’ll back the likely 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, telling a Herald reporter it’s ‘way too early.’ ‘She hasn’t declared!’ Warren said after a series of events in western Massachusetts…Warren also discussed her private meeting in December with Clinton in Washington, D.C., characterizing it as a ‘policy discussion.’” Women of New Hampshire, please be advised - The Hill: “Vice President [Joe Biden] will travel to New Hampshire Wednesday, his third trip to a state with an early 2016 presidential nominating contest this month.” [Malarkey meter - Politifact found that aside from being condescending, the vice president’s claim to have many good friends who are Somali cab drivers in Delaware is also demonstrably false.] RUDY THROWS OBAMA A LIFELINE Here’s a tip: If you are a politician and find yourself publicly questioning the patriotism of a foe’s dead, World-War-II-veteran grandfather, you’re probably having a bad day. And former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was certainly having a bad day on Thursday. Giuliani wrapped things up on “The Kelly File,” where he expanded his argument that President Obama doesn’t love America to include Obama’s family. An incredulous Megyn Kelly asked why Giuliani wasn’t worried about this being used against his party, to which Giuliani said it was okay because he was “right about this.” As if rightness were ever the ultimate defense in politics! Even if the president was having Saul Alinsky séances in the attic of the White House with Bill Ayers, Giuliani would of course have still harmed his party and one of its potential nominees, Scott Walker, who was present when Giuliani made the original remarks. Consider the speed with which embattled DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz pounced on Giuliani's remarks. She was probably moving so fast because she was thrown clear from the car crash of her Senate campaign launch. (Yikes.) The president and his party love this conversation. Just as they reveled in Donald Trump’s peak birtherism, they are doubtless squealing with delight at the thought of having a conversation about a thing of no importance that manages to fire up Democrats and further depict Republicans and mean, nasty nativists. Would you rather have to defend the administration’s ISIS and Libya policies or your “Greatest Generation” grandpa? Yup. Two lessons for Republicans in this: First, it doesn’t matter. The president has 100 weeks left in office. His upbringing, psychology and motivations will be an interesting topic for historians. They are not germane to current politics. It’s not as if NBC News and the New York Times didn’t know about his radical associates and will now drop what they’re doing for a five-part series on Jerimiah Wright. They know. They do not care. Republicans, much like Hillary Clinton in 2008, have often made the argument that Obama sees America differently – as a peer of other nations, not God’s anointed light in the world. Obama won anyway. He won in part because of Trump and others who made the argument about nativity and upbringing and not policy. One proves his opponent is a socialist by talking about his programs, not his high school friends. Maybe with some white dude, but not with the first African-American president. Like a five-gallon bucket of heavy-duty primer, accusations of racism cover a lot of imperfections. Obama won twice and he will serve out his last 700 days in a deepening haze of adoration from his supporters and the press. Giuliani being right or wrong will make no difference. “But what about the media double standard?” they cry. Democrats, including Obama, did go substantially unpunished for calling George W. Bush unpatriotic. The same goes when the president makes explicit and implicit claims that his rivals are unpatriotic for opposing his plans to increase taxes and spending. But complaining about media bias is like complaining about the fact that it was below zero this morning in Washington: It’s doesn’t change the reality. Just put on your booties and start walking. Which brings us to the second lesson for the GOP: Just win, baby. The next election will not be contested on the question of whether Barack Obama loves America. It will in all likelihood be contested on whether the Clintons can convince voters that it would be sexist to oppose Hillary, for all her flaws. Put another way, it will depend on whether the Republican nominee can make the case that having the first female president is not worth the baggage and policies she will be lugging with her. But neither side will be making much of an argument about Obama, other than its time for a change. As Walker tries to get astride a fast horse and seriously challenge Jeb Bush, he can ill afford to look like someone who lacks good judgment. Walker’s response in an Thursday appearance on CNBC was fine, saying that he wouldn’t offer a judgment, but that both Giuliani and Obama could speak for themselves. But it won’t end there. Walker now heads to Washington for the National Governors Association winter meeting where he will hear countless calls from the left, the press and some fellow Republicans to do what John McCain and Mitt Romney felt forced to do in similar situations: extoll at length the president’s love of country and marvelousness as a person. That always sounds like an admission of guilt. What Republican voters want to see is a fighter, not another version of the previous two campaigns, which were often mincing rather than marching. Maybe the Republicans running for president should start carrying air horns to blow any time they hear something offensive said about the president. But seriously, anyone who wants to criticize Obama for what he thinks or feels rather than what he does shouldn’t be within earshot of any of the frontrunners. And the frontrunners had better get serious about avoiding their company, no matter how rich they are. “Islam has been woven into the fabric of our country since its founding.” –President Obama at the Countering Violent Extremism Summit.

WATCH HERE. But don’t tell ISIS, okay? - Fox News: “A U.S. military official on Thursday outlined plans to retake the key Iraq city of Mosul from Islamic State terrorists as early as April…A senior U.S. Central Command official said that the ‘shaping’ for the battle is currently underway. The Iraqi military hopes to begin operations in the ‘April, May timeframe’ and retake the city before Ramadan begins on June 17.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... The Atlantic explores the life of Edwin Land, the inventor of instant photography. Land left Harvard before the end of his freshman year to finish his experiments on the plastic polarizer. The technology was a useful material to polarize light, an essential component to Eastman Kodak’s lenses and American Optical’s sunglasses. The polaroid is used in numerous applications today, everything from windshields to LCD screens. But before even taking his creation to market, Land sought legal protection for his ideas. Through his patent protections, he was able to commercialize the invention and keep competition at bay. A rather prolific inventor, Land was third on the list of U.S. inventors with 535 patents to his name. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Bucyrus (Ohio) Telegraph-Forum: “Kasich called opposition to Common Core ‘a runaway Internet campaign,’ reaffirming his support for the educational standards on a trip to South Carolina, as Ohio students began taking tests based on them this week…. [A]sked: ‘Why are candidates like you and Jeb Bush running away from the Common Core, your past support of the Common Core standards?’ [Kasich responded:] ‘That is not something that Barack Obama is putting together. ... It’s local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. I cannot figure out what's wrong with that. ...’To a large degree, it's a runaway Internet campaign, as far as I'm concerned in Ohio.’” [A recent NBC News poll found that 46 percent of South Carolina Republicans said they would find a candidate who supported Common Core standards to be “unacceptable.”] Christie frustrates backers - NYT: “The complaints have piled up for weeks, dismaying many longtime supporters of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and sending others into the arms of his rivals for the presidential nomination, according to interviews with more than two dozen Republican donors and strategists. As a half-dozen other candidates aggressively raise money and chase endorsements in Iowa and New Hampshire, friends and detractors alike say Mr. Christie’s view of his status and pre-eminence within the Republican field is increasingly at odds with the picture outside his inner circle.” Christie losing home-state donors as Jeb makes inroads - WaPo: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is rapidly losing support among some of his most prominent home-state donors and power brokers, who are either hesitant to back him or shifting allegiance to former Florida governor Jeb Bush. [NYT: “Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets and a top fund-raiser for the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, will support Jeb Bush’s likely presidential campaign in 2016. The decision adds to Mr. Bush’s efforts to dominate fund-raising in the first few months of 2015 to demonstrate the strength of a potential candidacy. It is also a blow to Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, who is considering a campaign of his own and has been struggling to attract new donor support.] Cruz stays running - Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is in Florida today to keynote the Duval County GOP’s Lincoln Day Dinner. Rand’s risky strategy - WashEx’s David Drucker sees hazards in Sen. Rand Paul’s, R-Ky., presidential ambitions: “Paul appears ready to risk a safe Republican Senate seat, and possibly Kentucky’s eight Electoral College votes… advancing a game plan to shift Kentucky’s 2016 nominating contest to a March caucus from the scheduled May statewide primary. State law prohibits any candidate from appearing on the ballot twice. But if Kentucky Republicans moved to a caucus, Paul could compete for, and assuredly win, the commonwealth’s GOP presidential nominating delegates and re-nomination to his Senate seat.” [The Hill: “Sen. Rand Paul [R-Ky.] is mulling attaching his Audit the Fed legislation to a vote to raise the debt ceiling, Paul spokesman Brian Darling told The Hill.] Sweet home - Paul is slated to participate in a forum on criminal justice reform in Louisville and is the featured speaker at the Alabama GOP’s Winter Dinner tonight in Montgomery. Rubio calls for college competition - Greenville [S.C.] News: “Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who may seek the Republican nomination for president, said in Greenville Thursday that he'd reduce student loan debt by giving four-year colleges more competition… ‘Right now, getting a four-year degree means going to a brick-and-mortar institution, sitting in a classroom for four years, getting 120 credit hours and they give you a piece of paper that certifies you graduated,’ he said. ‘And that will always continue as one of the choices, but we need to have alternatives to that as well.’” Bolton to New Hampshire - Former UN Ambassador John Bolton is the featured speaker at today’s installment of “Politics & Eggs” in New Hampshire. He is also launching the Foundation for American Security and Freedom [FASF], a nonprofit organization that aims to restore and protect America’s vital national security interests and preserve America’s way of life. Carson hires direct marketing maven for his top adviser - The Hill: “Ben Carson has hired a senior adviser for his political team ahead of a potential run for president in 2016. Mike Murray, the president and CEO of TMA Direct, a direct marketing firm, will serve as a senior adviser to Carson. Murray will oversee small-dollar grassroots fundraising for Carson, which could be an area where the retired neurosurgeon will excel. Carson has already hauled in millions of small-dollar donations through direct marketing efforts and a ‘Draft Carson’ campaign. Murray has also founded a political action committee called American Legacy. Carson served as the face of the group’s campaign against ObamaCare.” POWER PLAY: DHS DIVISION Republican strategist David Payne and Democrat Stephen Cobb join Chris Stirewalt to discuss the latest on divisions on Capitol Hill for funding of DHS and the impact of the Texas District Court injunction against President Obama's immigration actions.

Tammy Baldwin has hired a powerful Washington lawyer to represent her as she continues to grapple with the fallout from her office’s handling of the Tomah Veterans Affairs crisis. Attorney Marc Elias offered the first public acknowledgment on behalf of Baldwin that she fired top Wisconsin aide Marquette Baylor for her actions after the senator received a critical inspection report about opiate prescription practices at the Tomah VA Medical Center. Baldwin did not act on the report for four months, despite repeated pleas from a whistleblower, who urged Baylor to do something about the report last fall. … Elias did not provide a copy of the agreement or disclose what the accompanying cash payout would have been. His statement was initially reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.” Schock flights may violate House rules - USA Today: “Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Ill., has repeatedly spent taxpayer and campaign funds to rent aircraft that are not certified charter services, despite House rules and federal law that generally prohibit the use of private aircraft for official and campaign use. House rules have some exemptions, such as an Ethics Committee waiver that allows a lawmaker to use a private plane. Neither Schock nor his representatives, however, replied to repeated e-mails and calls about whether he obtained permission for the flights.” ANOTHER OBAMACARE DELAY WaPo: “One of these days, employers will experience the full effects of Obamacare, but not yet. In the latest in a long string of delays in enforcing the rules under the health care overhaul, the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department announced on Wednesday that they will wait until summer to start enforcing financial penalties on small businesses that provide so-called Health Reimbursement Arrangements to their employees. Under HRAs, employers provide spending accounts that their workers can use to cover a portion of the cost of buying individual health plans.” [Not winning? Just move the end zone.] Maybe they just really, really don’t like Rs - WaPo points out that the White House has been repeatedly misspelling “February” in official communications. #MEDIABUZZ This week Howard Kurtz welcomes Steve Hayes, Juan Williams and Sharyl Attkisson to analyze the coverage of President Obama and Eric Holder on their refusal to use the term Islamic terrorism.

PENNY PINCHER Reuters: “Canadian legislator Pat Martin on Thursday offered up one of the most original excuses ever heard for hurriedly running out of the House of Commons during a vote…Martin, who belongs to the official opposition New Democrats, bolted as members of Parliament began to rise one by one to vote. He later blamed his departure on an unwise purchase at a local store. ‘They had men’s underwear on for half price and I bought a bunch that was clearly too small for me. I find it difficult to sit for any length of time,’ he told the chamber to guffaws and applause from fellow legislators. Martin, one of the more colorful Canadian members of Parliament, did return in time to cast his vote.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is how the Clintons operate. They’ve always been right at the edge, from the cattle futures 25 years ago until today, where they walked the line where you would imagine that no other politicians would walk the line.

"HOT WATER FOR HILLARY IN FAMILY FIB BuzzFeed: “Speaking in Iowa Wednesday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that all her grandparents had immigrated to the United States, a story that conflicts with public census and other records related to her maternal and paternal grandparents. The story of her grandmother specifically immigrating is one Clinton has told before. Clinton’s sole foreign-born grandparent, Hugh Rodham Sr., immigrated as a child. ‘Her grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and, as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants,’ a Clinton spokesman told BuzzFeed News. ‘As has been correctly pointed out, while her grandfather was an immigrant, it appears that Hillary’s grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the U.S. in the early 1880s.’” In touch with people, well, certain people - Daily Mail: “Hillary Clinton’s astroturf candidacy is in full swing in Iowa. Her Tuesday morning visit to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa was staged from beginning to end, according to Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs. Clinton. Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour.” [A Clinton aide told Fox News the campaign never told the press this particular group just happened to meet Clinton – noting they handed the press pool a list of the names of attendees, signaling they were not hiding that they gathered this group to talk to her. “We didn’t say it was random” the aide said.] Clintons vow no retreat on foreign cash - WSJ: “The board of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation has decided to continue accepting donations from foreign governments, primarily from six countries, even though Hillary Clinton is running for president, a summary of the new policy to be released Thursday shows. The rules would permit donations from Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the U.K.-countries that support or have supported Clinton Foundation programs on health, poverty and climate change, according to the summary. That means other nations would be prohibited from making large donations to the foundation. But those governments would be allowed to participate in the Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary of the foundation where companies, nonprofit groups and government officials work on solutions to global problems.” Boffo oppo – David Drucker reports: “Nearly 100 staff of Republican opposition research group America Rising are digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton. The group has 20 full-time and more than 50 part-time trackers across the country, mostly in early primary states and big money hubs such as Boston, New York and San Francisco, to document Clinton's every move.” Hillary wants your data - Bloomberg Politics digs into the gold hunt for voter data behind the political operation Ready for Hillary: “While it’s true that the students who grabbed posters a little more than a week before Clinton’s April 12 campaign launch didn’t have to shell out any cash...they did have to sign their name. And give their e-mail address. And their cell phone number. And check a box indicating their ethnicity and sexual orientation….[For] Ready for Hillary, the pre-campaign super PAC, it was all about building the list. In political parlance, a list is a compilation of data on potential supporters – think a database of names, e-mails, and other personal information that a campaign can use to rally volunteers and raise money.” O’Malley tries to troll Hillary on same-sex marriage - WaPo: “Hillary Clinton, who has lagged many leaders of her party on the issue of gay marriage, has now called upon the U.S. Supreme Court to ‘come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right….’ One of Clinton’s potential Democratic rivals, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), has repeatedly taken none-too-veiled jabs at Clinton on the issue as he’s traveled to early nominating states. … On Wednesday afternoon, O’Malley’s political team released a short video highlighting his position that included a clip from a recent speech in which he said ‘history celebrates profiles in courage, not profiles in convenience.’ O’Malley led Maryland’s efforts to legalize same-sex marriage in 2012.” [O’Malley delivers a speech on the economy at Harvard’s Institute of Politics today.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Back in the 1850s Alaskans sold their state’s bountiful fresh water to California, albeit in frozen form, and they’re about to do it again. California’s persistent drought has reached dangerous levels, and as summer looms closer residents fear the combination of intense heat and restricted water use. The Anchorage Daily News reports that an Alaska company that bulk packages water from a local lake has secured contracts to ship its product to customers in California. The problem is California doesn’t have the ability to take in water from vessels so the company is contemplating loading the water into containers and shipping it that way.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), off to a fast fundraising start as an official candidate for president, is planning an aggressive series of events to haul in cash in his home state in late April and early May, a person familiar with his campaign plans said Wednesday. One of the events will involve billionaire businessman and philanthropist Norman Braman, who is expected to be one of Rubio’s biggest financial backers, said the person, who was granted anonymity to describe behind-the-scenes planning. That person also confirmed that Rubio raised about $1.25 million online on his first full day as a presidential candidate -- news first reported by the Associated Press. Rubio will raise money in Palm Beach on April 24, in Miami on May 2 and in Boca Raton on May 12, the person said. Braman will be involved in the Miami event.” PACing it in - Yesterday’s first quarter deadline showed little in terms of official reports from campaigns since there was only one official candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz, who was required to file; but as NYT shows, money pouring into PACs provides a lens into who has the green required for campaign staying power. Reports show the money raised from the first three months of the year. Aside from Mr. Cruz, Ben Carson comes in high at $2.1 million raised from his exploratory committee. Sen. Rubio’s $1.8 million goes to his Senate campaign committee, but will likely be transferred to his presidential committee. Sen. Rand Paul’s committee comes in low at $332,000, but his campaign raised $2 million from his website within days of his announcement. Ayotte has sweet bank - WMUR: “As Sen. Kelly Ayotte [R-N.H.] gears up for what could be a tough reelection bid in November 2016, possibly against Gov. Maggie Hassan [D-N.H.], her campaign already has more $3 million in the bank. Friends of Kelly Ayotte said Wednesday it raised more than $1.2 million during the first fundraising quarter of 2015, with over $3 million cash on hand. Ayotte raised more than $208,000 from New Hampshire donors, the campaign committee said. Also, WMUR.com has learned, the Ayotte campaign has hired two new top staffers. The campaign's finance director is Michalle Makarov, formerly deputy finance director on Gov. Susana Martinez’s [R] campaign in New Mexico. She is also an alumna of Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign.” [Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, makes a few stops in New Hampshire today first at a small business roundtable in Nashua, then he hosts a youth town hall meeting in Milford.] Christie on Clinton: ‘If I run I will beat her’ – USA Today: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is confident he can defeat Hillary Clinton for president - and put blue states such as Pennsylvania and New Mexico into play. ‘If I run, I will beat her,’ Christie told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a swipe at Clinton’s tenure as secretary of State, Christie also said ‘there would be no misunderstandings’ with Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is elected president.” JEB STEPS UP EVANGELICAL OUTREACH WITH LIBERTY SPEECH NY Times: “Former Gov. Jeb Bush will pay a visit to the heart of the conservative movement next month when the likely presidential candidate gives a commencement address at Liberty University. Speaking at Liberty University, which was founded by the evangelical leader Jerry Falwell, is a rite of passage for Republicans seeking the presidency. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas opened his 2016 presidential campaign there last month, Mitt Romney gave a commencement address at the Lynchburg, Va., college in 2012, and Senator John McCain did so as well in 2006. University officials said on Wednesday that Mr. Bush would speak at Liberty’s 42nd commencement on May 9.”","637","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/16/hot-water-for-hillary-in-family-fib.html"
"New Mississippi education law backed by Bush - WaPo: “Jeb Bush is spending part of Thursday in Mississippi at a bill-signing ceremony for legislation backed by his education foundation. Bush is scheduled to be at the Mississippi state Capitol as Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signs a bill that provides vouchers to parents of children with special needs to spend up to $6,500 annually in taxpayer funds to pay for private schools or other services to help the child…. The new law is also modeled on a program Bush established as Florida governor that benefits roughly 28,000 students, according to Bush aides. [Bush attends “Politics and Pie” in Concord, New Hampshire today. Bush will also speak at the #FITN Republican Leadership Summit tomorrow.] IRAN BILL A ‘BRUISING RETREAT’ FOR OBAMA NYT: “Mr. Obama’s abrupt decision to sign a compromise version of legislation on Iran that he had previously vowed to veto was a bruising retreat in his larger campaign to act without Congress’s getting in his way. In this case, partisanship gave way to rare consensus on Capitol Hill: Both sides agreed that he was wrong to cut them out. The White House tried to make the best of the setback, arguing that the bipartisan bill was less objectionable than the initial draft. But the president’s concession in the face of potentially veto-proof majorities underscored that even his fellow Democrats believed he had overreached in trying to operate on his own. And it suggested that he may be approaching the outer boundaries of his authority with 21 months left in office.” [“Republicans by a ratio of more than 2-to-1 say the U.S. should support Israel even when its stances diverge with American interests, a new Bloomberg Politics poll finds. Democrats, by roughly the same ratio, say the opposite is true and that the U.S. must pursue its own interests over Israel’s.”] The Judge’s ruling - Posing the question: “Can the president kill you?” Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano notes that the use of drones for the targeted killing of Americans by President Obama and sanctioned by congressional oversight is reminiscent if the actions of a British tyrant. “[T]he Constitution he swore to uphold makes clear that whenever the government wants the life, liberty or property of anyone, it must follow due process…. The whole reason for the requirement of due process was to prevent what Henry VIII did and Obama is doing from ever happening here…When the president acts like a king and Congress looks the other way, it is as culpable as he is.” THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY… “A brush fire that had been intentionally set for land management purposes ended up causing heat damage to 11 homes in Crystal Lake (Ill.), the fire department said. … Fire officials said the prescribed burn was done for land management purposes and that the damage was caused by radiant heat from the nearby fire. …Rick Dowell, said he watched the fire being started in the wetlands near his property at about noon. After a short while, however, he said the flames shot higher than his barn and the workers in the wetlands appeared to become flustered. ‘I saw the workers running to put it out,’ he said. ‘They seemed a little panicked. (I think) it got bigger than they expected. It appears it went faster than they intended.’” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “[Sen. Marco Rubio is] proposing something different here, he’s proposing tax cuts, and I think this argument between him and the Wall Street Journal over what is essentially 2 percent of the rate, I think it’s slightly over exaggerated. It’s not going to make any difference in the real world if there’s a one or two percent lower rate, and I think what’s he’s doing is trying to win votes with the sweetener of the child tax credit, there’s nothing wrong with that.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"Remarkably, since taking control of both the House and Senate, Republicans have systematically ceded the initiative to the Democrats. The GOP has shot itself in the foot; starting with their inept strategy to counter President Obama’s executive amnesty on immigration culminating with their hapless capitulation on funding for Homeland Security to committing missteps like the Iran letter which offers Obama and the Democrats a scapegoat should the Iran deal fall through.

"The GOP finds itself in the tenuous position of having to depend on Democrats to accomplish things. This is a hugely ironic outcome for a party that claimed, last November, to have won a stronger mandate to govern than we’ve seen in decades. As a consequence they are facing a potential fracturing of their own voting base – the very voters who delivered to the party a landslide victory just a few short months ago.","676","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"

"The Republicans never crafted and sustained a narrative message to promote their agenda, which should’ve been founded on a pro-growth economic strategy, piecemeal immigration reform and sensible fixes to Obamacare.

Indeed, only 16% of Republican voters wanted both Boehner and McConnell elected to top leadership; 53% preferring neither or someone new.

And it is now Democrats who say they will protect Boehner’s speakership against a conservative revolt.","682","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"Boehner was right to ensure that essential DHS funding should continue.

"These voters wanted the GOP to make Obama’s pending order a campaign issue last fall. Indeed, the reason President Obama delayed his executive action until after the election was because their polling had found that the issue had turned toxic. A large majority of voters opposed the specifics of what the president was to do, and even larger majorities opposed the president taking executive action unilaterally. But the Republicans never confronted it, never got on the record saying that the president didn’t have the authority to do what he did, never forced Democrats to take sides.","684","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"Crucially, they have also yet to come up with a comprehensive immigration plan that puts border security first and only then offers a limited pathway to legal residence to those who obey the law and pay taxes. This is a plan that the base will accept and one that many Democrats will arguably support.","685","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"Similarly it appears the Republicans have not been able to put forth a party-wide position on how they would revise, reform or replace ObamaCare, which was with immigration the other major issue of concern to independents who voted for the Republicans in November. In each of these cases not only have they failed to advance a substantive agenda, they have failed to make a sustained political case to the majority of Americans who support them on immigration and ObamaCare – indeed not even on the Keystone Pipeline veto where a vast majority of all Americans supported the pipeline.","686","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"As a result, the Republican leadership has had nothing much more to fall back on than anti-Obamaism. Some key players, like Bush, realized that this futile approach won’t win back the White House. “It’s good to oppose the bad things, but we need to start being for things,” Bush told the CPAC crowd.","687","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"He’s right, but Bush may be the wrong bearer of that message. The Republican establishment leadership has no clue about its voters who are the most alienated and most anti-Washington in the electorate. If they did, they would’ve adopted some of their voters’ core concerns in January, when they took possession of congress.","688","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"In this climate, an insurgent anti-establishment/anti-corruption candidate could clean up in the Republican primaries. And that’s a big part of Scott Walker’s initial appeal. He’s selling a message of what he’s accomplished, and not just ideology and anti-Obamaism.","689","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"
"But whether it’s Walker next year or another candidate, someone needs to start carrying the Republican banner—in campaigns and in the political battles in Washington. Republican voters thought they’d elected such representation last fall. They’ve been bitterly disappointed. Expect to see consequences, and soon.","690","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/25/republican-partys-leadership-vacuum.html"

"CAN MCCONNELL THAW THE SENATE WITHOUT GETTING SOAKED? The 114th Congress gets underway today in a snowy Washington with all the media attention on the noisy effort by a small group of Republican foes of House Speaker John Boehner to embarrass the GOP leader by denying him a first-ballot victory in his election to a third term. But the real action is over in the other chamber, where we will see the first test of incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s effort to reopen the Senate for actual legislation following years of his predecessor’s Heat Miser-style deep freeze. [The Hill is keeping a running list on Republicans who are opposing Boehner. Here is where the count stands.] Piped in - The first order of business in the Senate is a bipartisan bill to force the Obama administration to allow an oil pipeline from Canada to be completed. The eventual Keystone XL vote will be the first test of McConnell’s plan to revive the Senate, which seized up during the Harry Reid-era,. For much of Reid’s reign, even Democrats were usually forbidden to introduce or alter legislation on their own. Today marks the return to “regular order” and the first test of McConnell’s effort to thaw things out. And it comes with considerable risk. Democrats have a plan to punish McConnell for the move by not just killing the bill but bedeviling the process. There seem to be the six Democratic votes needed to advance the legislation, however Reid and his presumed eventual successor, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have hopes of hopes of breaking up the bipartisan fun and protecting President Obama from having to veto the popular plan. “I think we’ve got all 54 Republicans, looks like they’ll be original co-sponsors and more than half a dozen Democrats. The votes are there.” – Sen-elect Ben Sasse, R-Neb., on the Senate Keystone XL pipeline bill, on “FOX & Friends” this morning. Tougher path - McConnell is expected to preserve the biggest Reid-era change: lowering the threshold for confirming presidential nominees other than Supreme Court justices from 60 votes to 51 votes. But by reassuming the old, open Senate rules that give broad latitude to all members of both parties to introduce bills and amendments, McConnell is making his job much harder. Not only will he face hijinks from Democrats, but he will give up Reid’s policy of handcuffing problematic members of his own party.

The person who seeks out the thrill and fear is very different from one who seeks out a drama or a comedy. Studies have shown that the terror in these films induces physiological responses similar to “fight-or-flight”. The New Republic examines personality traits associated with the majority of horror film seekers. The first characteristic is a lack of empathy where studies have shown that participants with strong emotional feelings were more likely to be distressed by the movies. Viewers who tend to be more aggressive and thrill-seeking also tend to find violent scenes funny and exciting. Previous research indicated that when the audience was male with only 2 percent of men experienced negative side effects after viewing a film, though newer studies show that women may be catching up to men in this regard. In a final trait, an offshoot of previous conclusions, viewers of scary films tend to be men accompanied by frightened women. Research has shown that men tend to enjoy these films more when accompanied by a woman who was troubled by the film. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

"JEB LAUNCHES LEADERSHIP PAC In his most direct step yet towards a 2016 White House bid, Jeb Bush will be filling paperwork today to officially launch his leadership political action committee, which will be called the Right to Rise PAC. In a statement to Fox News, a source close to the former Florida governor said, “We will celebrate success and risk taking, protect liberty, cherish free enterprise, strengthen our national defense, embrace the energy revolution, fix our broken and obsolete immigration system, and give all children a better future by transforming our education system through choice, high standards and accountability.” The Right to Rise PAC would also help pay the expenses of a burgeoning staff, polling, and finance Bush trips across the country as a possible 2016 contender. The formation of this leadership PAC as well as a separate super PAC by Bush supporters – could be used to flush other GOP potential aspirants out of the 2016 field, by essentially, flexing the formidable financial strength of Jeb’s donor network. Bush is holding a private fundraiser Wednesday, in Greenwich, Conn., and more fundraising events are planned in Florida and Washington, D.C. in the next few weeks, as are meetings with major donors.– More from Fox News here. [Watch Fox: Campaign Carl Cameron has the latest on Jeb’s move.] And none too soon - Reflecting the reality of 2016 frontrunner status, Jeb is already facing ramped-up scrutiny of his views on same-sex marriage. Reacting to a judge’s ruling allowing gay couples to wed in parts of the former Florida governor’s home state, he told the Miami Herald Sunday “It ought be a local decision. I mean, a state decision,” The state decided. The people of the state decided. But it’s been overturned by the courts, I guess.” NYT, citing his long time opposition to same-sex marriages, said Bush “…struck a conciliatory note on Monday, telling The New York Times that ‘regardless of our disagreements, we have to respect the rule of law.’…Gay rights leaders said they found Mr. Bush’s statement on Monday encouraging. Fred Sainz, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a group that has pushed for same-sex marriage, said that ‘most Republican politicians have been adamant in their opposition and provide no room for evolution.’ Mr. Bush ‘at least is expressing his respect for those who support marriage equality,’ Mr. Sainz said. ‘That’s a big change for Republicans.’” On same-sex marriage, a consistent view but changing language - Buzzfeed reaches back two decades with a deep dive on Jeb Bush’s views on same-sex marriage. “Two decades ago, Jeb Bush wrote there should be no special rights for LGBT people. ‘This opinion editorial from 20 years ago does not reflect Gov. Bush’s views now, nor would he use this terminology today,’ a spokeswoman said. Jeb Bush has said gay couples shouldn’t be ‘discriminated against.’ He has argued that same-sex parents who ‘love their children with all their heart and soul’ are ‘examples to others.’ … The former Florida governor hasn’t changed his position on same-sex marriage. He opposes it, and has since he first ran for office more than 20 years ago.","695","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/06/can-mcconnell-thaw-senate-without-getting-soaked.html"
"But Bush’s recent, somewhat sympathetic language about LGBT rights provides a marked contrast to his early comments on the issue – more in rhetoric than policy.”] Romney sets speech to key N.Y. business group - News Day: “Former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney will be the featured speaker at the Long Island Association’s biannual luncheon in March, the Island’s largest business organization said Monday. The March 25 event will feature a one-on-one discussion with Romney led by LIA president Kevin Law…Past guest speakers include former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.” COWBOYS OWNER PAID FOR CHRISTIE’S PRIVATE JET FLIGHT The New Jersey Star Ledger reports that a trip by Gov. Chris Christie to watch a Dallas Cowboys game, which included a private jet, was paid for by team owner, Jerry Jones. The governor’s spokesman Kevin Roberts, said, “Governor Christie attended the game last night as a guest of Jerry Jones, who provided both the ticket and transportation at no expense to New Jersey taxpayers.” Despite the criticism for his junkets and love for one of the most hated teams in his home state, Christie said he might do it again and fly to Wisconsin for Sunday’s Cowboys-Packers showdown. Santorum to huddle with top aides - Bloomberg: “The hour of decision is drawing near. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum has invited several former aides to a ‘private briefing’ in Washington, DC, next week….” Carson Super PAC lifts off - Buzzfeed: “The man behind the Draft Ben Carson for President Committee has launched a new super PAC that will snap into action when Carson announces a presidential bid, he said on Monday. …The Draft Ben Carson for President Committee has raked in huge amounts of cash, receiving $12,027,461 according to the latest FEC tally. It has also spent nearly as much as it’s taken in: $11,265,270.” WARREN NOT BACKING OFF HILLARY WALL STREET KNOCK WBZ: “…[We] asked [Sen. Elizabeth Warren] if her indictment [of corporate influence over Congress] included former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a major beneficiary of Citigroup political donations over the years. ‘I’m just calling out the problem we have right now in Washington, and Citigroup is an example of these big corporations who have undue influence right there in Washington,’ said Warren. Asked if the public should be wary of Citigroup ties to Clinton and current Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who was chief operating officer of Citigroup in the years prior to the 2008 financial meltdown, Warren said: ‘The public should absolutely be wary of the influence of Citigroup and other large financial corporations and the power they wield in Washington.’” Another hire for Hillary - Politico: “The high-dollar super PAC that plans to support a Hillary Clinton presidential candidacy is bringing on a new finance director to aid it with the daunting task of raising hundreds of millions of dollars for 2016. Justin Brennan, who worked on President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign and also raised money for Clinton in 2008, is expected to join Priorities USA as its finance director in the coming weeks, four people familiar with the hire said.”","696","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/06/can-mcconnell-thaw-senate-without-getting-soaked.html"
"SCRABBLE RABBLE Australian Broadcasting reports that the country’s Scrabble Players Association is set to reverse the suspension of Mohammed Hegazi, who was banned from playing the board game competitively for one year. The allegations included bullying, intimidation and cheating. A court overturned the ban and ordered the group to print a retraction on Hegazi’s behalf. However the cheating allegations remained and Hegazi was ordered to pay the association’s court costs of just over $3,000. Hegazi fought the deal, though ultimately agreed to the original terms, saying “I'm a bit disappointed because the definition is not legally clear.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “Republicans are going to have a chance to show how retroactively for the last six years everything has stopped in the Senate - Democrats stopped it, Harry Reid stopped it and they effectively acted as a shield to make [President Obama] look as if he wasn't the one stopping stuff. Well, now he’s going to be exposed because he’s going to have to exercise the veto.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"2016 POWER INDEX: UNSTEADY WALKER STILL JEB’S TOP RIVAL, BUT PRESS PILE ON CONTINUES Oddly, the cardinal attribute now sought in a presidential candidate is the ability to successfully evade horrid questions. And Scott Walker is learning that the hard way. The Wisconsin governor’s most recent error was complaining aloud about a puerile question posed by the WaPo about what Walker believed President Obama believes about Jesus Christ. In so doing, Walker gave the kind of response his questioners were hoping for, because the words “I don’t know” were part of a soliloquy on media bias. A question like this is the rhetorical equivalent of throwing a wolverine at a man’s face and then writing the headline: “Candidate struggles with wolverine attack.” Well, yeah... But the wolverines will keep coming, and so will the honey badgers, ferrets, otters and the rest of the family Mustelidae. And if you want to be president, you’d better find a way to deal with it. This is Walker’s second such error. On a trip to London earlier this month, Walker let his internal monologue slip out when he said he was going to “punt” a crummy question about evolution. When being treated like a native shipped back to England by Captain Cook, it would be tempting to say much worse than that. But even announcing the “punt” was bad enough. What Walker said subsequently was just fine. But his blurted intention to evade was all that anyone will remember. If you want to dodge, just look to the president, who has punted for more yards in Washington than anyone since Sammy Baugh. The president just boots that sucker down to the other end zone, the ball carried aloft on great gusts of windy words. In order to fulfill the media narrative in which Jeb Bush is the sensible candidate trying to tame an insane Republican Party, Scott Walker must be made into an insane person. He is trying hard not to oblige the press, but if he wants to win, he will have to stop telegraphing his evasions and do what every other successful politician does and just dropkick his answers.

Send your thoughts to FOXNEWSFIRST@FOXNEWS.COM] Miami vice: WaPo restocks story on Jeb’s wife’s spending - WaPo goes back to the 1990s to look at the spending habits of Columba Bush, wife of then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush “…she took out a loan to buy $42,311.70 worth of jewelry on a single day, according to records filed with the state of Florida by Mayors Jewelers. That purchase was part of a pattern by Columba Bush of borrowing to buy tens of thousands of dollars of jewelry at a time from the South Florida store over a 14-year period.” Government worker unions reeling under Walker rules - WaPo: “The anti-union law passed here four years ago, which made Gov. Scott Walker a national Republican star and a possible presidential candidate, has turned out to be even more transformative than many had predicted. Walker had vowed that union power would shrink, workers would be judged on their merits, and local governments would save money. Unions had warned that workers would lose benefits and be forced to take on second jobs or find new careers. Many of those changes came to pass, but the once-thriving ­public-sector unions were not just shrunken, they were crippled. Unions representing teachers, professors, trash collectors and other government employees are struggling to stem plummeting membership rolls and retain relevance in the state where they got their start.” Rubio steps it up in New Hampshire - WMUR: “U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is heading to New Hampshire to interact directly with voters who will help determine his presidential fate. Rubio, a Republican, is traveling to key early voting states to promote his book, ""American Dreams."" Rubio's trip to New Hampshire includes a Q-and-A session with voters in Hollis and a book signing in Manchester [today]. He'll also speak at 'Politics & Eggs' on Tuesday in Manchester. ...Observers doubted whether Rubio would run for president against his political mentor, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, but Rubio recently signaled he is serious about a run by hiring New Hampshire operative Jim Merrill.” Poll: Cruz, Walker all tied up in Texas - Texas Tribune: “Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has erased U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz’s strong lead among Texas Republicans in the volatile and still-developing race for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and author Ben Carson were tied at 9 percent, and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry was next at 8 percent.” Perry plays up hawkish stance on Putin - Weekly Standard: “Former Texas governor Rick Perry is taking on Russian president Vladimir Putin. The possible presidential candidate says that the ‘peace and security of the world’ depends on how America deals with Russia in a video statement…‘The United States needs to get back in the game. The administration’s actions have put us on the sidelines. We need to lead our allies, this is Russia we are talking about. We have to stop telling Putin what we won’t do and telegraphing our limitations. Obama always thinks through the consequences of action, and never considers the consequences of inaction.

John Kasich, R-Ohio, defended his decision take Medicaid expansion money under Obamacare, rival Sixteener Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has called a move by governors who think money grows on trees. ‘You know, Matthew 25 says that it’s about how you treat the widowed, how you treat the poor, how you treat the hungry,’ Kasich said on CNN. ‘How do you clothe those who have no clothes? That is a conservative position to help them get on their feet so they then can assume their rightful place in our society.’ In Kentucky, he added, ‘maybe everybody’s fine, maybe there aren’t people who are suffering these problems.’” “I’m not saying I won’t. I’m not saying I will. I’m leaving my options out there and we’ll see how things develop.” –Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, on CNN. The Galilee Primary - Mike Huckabee is the only top-tier Republican candidate taking a pass on this week’s CPAC cattle call, but WaPo explains what he’s been up to: “…Huckabee is currently shepherding his flock of 253 paying guests around Israel for 10 days. That’s six busloads — a lot more people than may follow some candidates around New Hampshire in February next year. The Huckabee entourage includes … country western star Larry Gatlin, who came off the bus here at Masada sporting a burnt-orange cap with a stitched-on pistol and the words “Texas: We Don’t Call 911” — which is kind of appropriate if you know the story of Masada. The price is $5,250, including round-trip airfare from New York, five-star hotel accommodations, all meals, deluxe motor-coach transport, licensed guides and all fees, tips and taxes. Huckabee’s wife, Janet, said they tell guests they can bring a $20 bill and come home with the change.” Pence plucky - Fox News: “Indiana Gov. Mike Pence suggested Sunday that he’s still considering a 2016 White House run but brushed aside questions about whether his expected mid-spring decision will leave him too far behind the coalescing GOP field.” “I was raised to say ‘do what is in front of you, do it well.’ and then we'll consider whatever opportunities.” –Gov.

He said the foundation should reinstate the policies used from 2009 to 2013. ‘It doesn’t seem right.’ … Beyond the headlines, many Democrats say it shows the need for Clinton to begin actively campaigning and build an apparatus better suited to rapidly respond to these types of critiques. ‘There’s a vacuum,’ said Tom Henderson, the chairman of the Polk County, Iowa, Democrats, who noted potential candidates such as former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb are visiting soon. ‘She isn’t doing anything’ in Iowa, he said.” Indigestion over branding - WaPo: “Is Hillary Rodham Clinton a McDonald’s Big Mac or a Chipotle burrito bowl?

Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal saw a few Marines raising an American flag in the rubble atop Mt. Suribachi on the island of Iwo Jima, scene of one of the most intense battles of World War II. Just as he reached the scene to capture the moment, however, the flag was already up. Rosenthal saw another group raising an even larger flag nearby, and seized his chance. He took the photograph that would go on to win him a Pulitzer Prize and a place in American history. The image of the Marines captured on this day 70 years ago served as the model for the Marine Corps War Memorial and continues to serve as a symbol of the determination and pride that the Marines embody.

The impasse continues amid reports that Senate Republicans are considering a plan in which they would split off legislation attacking the president’s executive actions, but it’s unclear whether conservative Republicans would go along with de-coupling it from DHS funding. “‘We would try to have a vote on just that issue,’ a Republican aide told the Hill. ‘Does it have to be addressed as part of DHS, or can it be addressed separately? If we can get to that issue and have a vote on that issue, then you come back to DHS appropriations.’” With the House returning Tuesday evening, just three days remain for Congress to work out a legislative solution. Hello, Iowa! - “I hope my House colleagues will understand that our best bet is to challenge this in court, that if we don’t fund the Department of Homeland Security, we'll get blamed as a party.” –Sen.

But in stopping the transit of petroleum from the forests of Alberta to the Gulf Coast, Mr. Obama will be opening the veto era of his presidency. The expected Keystone veto, the third and most significant of Mr. Obama's six years in office, would likely be followed by presidential vetoes of bills that would make changes in the Affordable Care Act, impose new sanctions on Iran and roll back child nutrition standards, among others.” [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel with the latest on the immigration/DHS funding fight from Capitol Hill.] Government bank under fire yanks public info - The Hill: “Critics of the Export-Import Bank are seething over the removal from a government Web site of previously public data earlier they say helps them detect cronyism.

""During a regular quarterly review, it was decided to reformat the way data is presented,"" the source said. Under the changes, bank officials are no longer disclosing denied applicants.

Johnson said the leaders argue their religion is about peace and brotherhood and ‘resent’ that Islamic State is ‘attempting to hijack that from us.’ Obama is facing sharp criticism, even from within his own party, for instead using the term ‘violent extremism’ to describe the actions of ISIS and other terror groups that are based on a form of Islam…” No shouting, please - Reuters: “U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif met for two hours in Geneva on Sunday in another round of nuclear talks to try to narrow gaps as they pressed against a March 31 deadline to reach a political agreement.” NEVER BET AGAINST MEGATOAD Matt “Megatoad” Stonie set the bacon-eating world record by consuming 182 slices in five minutes.

"Earlier this month, CIA Director John Brennan announced his plans for an organizational overhaul of the Agency. He put forward two major changes: the creation of a new directorate that will centralize the Agency’s cyber capabilities under the intentionally opaque name of “Digital Innovation” and the creation of ten new centers that would mix operators, that is, Agency personnel that run foreign spies, and analysts. What areas—what national security topics—the ten new centers would cover was left unstated by Brennan. Skeptics of Brennan’s plan see it them as just a matter of moving and rearranging boxes and lines on an organizational flow chart: an old Washington game that adopts the appearance of reforming while still leaving deeper, more fundamentally flawed bureaucratic cultures untouched.","Published March 19, 2015","844","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/19/truth-about-that-cia-makeover.html"
"There is some truth to this criticism. However, organizational rearrangements can matter and can change how business is done by changing reporting and incentive structures. Our own constitution was adopted precisely because the first US constitution, the Articles of Confederation, was found inadequate in part precisely because it’s “lines and boxes” (the branches of government) were not sufficiently delineated and properly structured for effective governing. As the news stories of Brennan’s proposed plans have noted, the creation of the topic centers builds upon the apparent success of the Intelligence Community’s National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), where analysts and operators have worked cheek by jowl for the past few years. By most accounts, this side-by-side arrangement has sharpened the focus of analysts to address senior policymakers and military officers’ most pressing concerns, while also giving operators a much clearer idea of what kind of information they should be seeking from assets to help fill in the terrorism picture. For most of the CIA’s history, there has been a wall between the operations directorate and the agency’s analytic arm, with case officers from the former running spies and directing covert operations and analysts, sitting in another side of the building, interpreting whatever secrets or other data are fed into the Agency from abroad. It was the latter’s responsibility to provide the “finished” intelligence product—be it notes, daily briefs, or longer-term estimates—to the president and other senior officials. Although every bureaucratic arrangement will have its virtues and its problems, this traditional arrangement of dividing the “do-ers” from the “thinkers” had a broad tendency to create a less thoughtful approach to operations and analytic products that might be interesting but not especially relevant to the day-to-day decision-making needs of policymakers. Of course, there are always exceptions to this pattern. Some of the best analysis of a given problem or country came via a CIA operations officer working abroad, while on occasion an analyst might provide innovative plan for how best to tackle a particular security problem. But, in general, this was not the way the Agency operated and the two distinct, internal bureaucratic cultures became more the norm than not. The NCTC, established as part of the package of intelligence reforms put in place in the wake of the attacks on 9/11, was not in fact the first entity to bring down the wall between operators and analysts. In the mid-1980s, when Middle East terrorism was already taking its toll on Americans, the CIA, under then Director of Central Intelligence William Casey, established the first CTC. As the center’s first head, Duane Clarridge, has written, what was proposed “was nothing less than a revolution within the CIA. The CTC was absolutely without precedent—the Agency had never organized across directorate lines for anything before,” with each directorate being “a sacred fiefdom unto itself.” But the fact the Agency had already created a centralized counterterrorism center before 9/11 raises the question of what difference did it make when the attacks on New York and the Pentagon went undetected? In the case of the CIA’s counterterrorism effort against Al Qaeda prior to 9/11, two major obstacles prevented that effort from being as effective as it could have been. The first was the existing wall between the various intelligence agencies of the U.S. government, who were reluctant to share information and often failed to do so out of a concern that the politically delicate line between foreign and domestic intelligence would be traversed. In theory, those problems have now been fixed. The second problem was simply one of political will. In the late 90s, at times, the difficulty was not a lack of operationally relevant intelligence. Instead, the Clinton White House lacked the will to authorize strikes against Al Qaeda and snatch or kill its leaders when it had them in its sights.","845","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/19/truth-about-that-cia-makeover.html"
"As one former military head of the Special Operations Command, General Pete Schoomaker, pointedly remarked about his command’s exasperations, we were “never given the mission. It was very, very frustrating. It was like having a brand-new Ferrari in the garage, and nobody wants to race it because you might dent the fender.” In short, there is always a limit to what organizational changes can be expected to accomplish. At the end of the day, even the best intelligence can’t overcome a reluctant president.","846","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/19/truth-about-that-cia-makeover.html"

"HILLARY TO BE QUEEN OF QUEENS? As Hillary Clinton prepares to make her official announcement of a second presidential run, Campaign Carl Cameron reports that a docking station for the mother ship will soon be revealed: “Clinton insiders say she’s now leaning toward putting her national headquarters in Long Island City in the New York City borough of Queens, and they could move in within two months.” Hypotheticals - In latest Quinnipiac poll, voters in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida were asked about matchups between Hillary Clinton and potential Republican nominees. In Ohio, Gov. John Kasich pulls into a statistical tie with 43 percent to Hillary’s 44 percent of the vote. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was in a statistical tie with Clinton in his home state, 43 percent to 44 percent. Sen. Marco Rubio lags behind by 10 points, 39 to 49 percent. O’Malley drills Obama from the left - In a NYT op-ed, Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, D-Md., writes against President Obama’s decision to allow drilling along the Atlantic coast: “To allow drilling off the Atlantic Coast is to willfully forget Deepwater’s awful lesson even as the economic, environmental and public health consequences continue to reverberate in communities along the gulf.” [The Des Moines Register reports that O’Malley has booked at least two upcoming visits to Iowa in addition to travel to New Hampshire and South Carolina.] WHY ARE REPUBLICANS CATCHING DEMS’ VACCINE WOES? Katherine Miller in BuzzFeed: “But who are these people pandering to? What part, exactly, of the Republican coalition so opposes mandatory requirements that, in the context of a measles outbreak, vaccination is a compromise issue? Because here’s the truth: This is largely a liberal fringe issue. The people not vaccinating their kids against the diseases once declared defeated don’t live in South Carolina or Indiana or a particularly conservative part of Ohio or Florida. That isn’t where people are contracting the whooping cough… No, the strongholds are in places like Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Marin County, California. The affluent, the educated, the enlightened, the ones who believe in purity and science — people in liberal enclaves are the ones rejecting one of the 20th century’s major scientific achievements. [Marin [Calif.] Independent Journal: “At Greenwood School in Mill Valley, 61 percent of the kindergartners are partially or completely unvaccinated, according to state figures. At San Geronimo Valley Elementary in San Geronimo, 58 percent of the kindergarten children are partially or completely unvaccinated.”] “Now, as of 2011, 19 states had “philosophical” exemptions — the way you might oppose designated hitter, except in this instance, you oppose a medical professional immunizing your child from rubella, and cool, that works. Many of those states, with a fair amount of exceptions like Texas and Louisiana, conjure the image of people hiking in fleeces. California, Vermont, Washington state, Maine, New Mexico, Colorado. These are states where one can oppose vaccination for personal reasons. JEB JUMPS IN FOR CPAC NRO:“[F]ormer Florida governor [Jeb Bush] will speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual event hosted by the American Conservative Union and attended largely by the party’s young activists….The exact date of Bush’s remarks has yet to be determined, but the conference will take place from February 25–28 in National Harbor, Maryland. …. Several other potential 2016 candidates will join Bush at the conference, including neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, former Texas governor Rick Perry, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.” Beltway bucks, too - Politico: “Jeb Bush [R-Fla.] is starting to shake the D.C. money tree. The former Florida governor is headed to the Beltway Feb. 17 for two fundraising events for his leadership political action committee, called Right to Rise. Bush is slated to attend a late morning and luncheon reception at BGR Group’s Washington offices. The invitation lists three levels of contributions: $10,000 for co-hosts, $5,000 for hosts and $1,000 for attendees. Another fundraiser that evening will be at Laura and Jamie Wareham’s McLean, Virginia home.” Bushworld 3.0 - The Hill: “Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has hired two experienced Republican communications operatives to advise his political action committee and potential 2016 presidential campaign. Danny Diaz and Jon Downs will become advisers to Bush’s Right to Rise PAC, an organization that could serve as the precursor to his official bid. They will likely join a campaign organization should he choose to run…Diaz was a top communications adviser to Sen. John McCain’s [R-Ariz.] campaign for the presidency in 2008, and he worked on the 2004 reelection effort of former President George W. Bush. Downs is an ad creator who has worked for Sen. Dan Sullivan [R-Alaska] and Sen. Ted Cruz [R-Texas] and is known for aggressive spots.” [Choosing up - The Houston Chronicle reports that Bush’s new hires mean the end of the relationship between the presidential campaign of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Terry Nelson, the former political director for George W. Bush who is a partner of Diaz and Downs at the firm FP1 Strategies.] “I think many candidates are at the point now where we’re starting to assess political support financial support, build a team. I am doing all those things as well. Certainly my name recognition isn't what the other candidates is because I haven't been in politics my whole life.” – Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina on “The Kelly File” Watch here. WALKER TELLS IOWANS HE’S ONE OF ROMNEY’S ‘FRESH FACES’ Des Moines Register: “In what sounded like a full-throttle campaign speech, Wisconsin’s Scott Walker went on the attack against his presumptive rivals in the presidential race, telling Iowans on a conference call Monday night that the country needs a proven leader who can take on everyone from Washington liberals to terrorists…During a question-and-answer session, a Des Moines man mentioned that when Mitt Romney officially bowed out of any 2016 speculation on Friday, the 2012 nominee said it's time for fresh leadership in the Republican party. ‘What do you think he meant by that and is that you?’ the caller asked Walker. Walker answered that he phoned Romney, ‘a good and decent man,’ on Friday. ‘I thanked him specifically for pointing that out,’ Walker said. ‘I think, you know, there's others – my friend [Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.] is about the same age and so in terms of fresh faces I guess he and I would be in a similar vein,’ Walker said.” Hello, Wisconsin - Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: “Gov. Scott Walker [R-Wis.] hired another group of political operatives in preparation for his anticipated presidential campaign…Kirsten Kukowski, a University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, will serve as ‘Our American Revival’ communications director…The Tarrance Group, which has been a key player in Walker in governor’s races, will be heavily represented. Ed Goeas, president and CEO of Tarrance, will serve as senior adviser... The data officer will be Mark Stephenson, who worked on the campaign for Iowa's new Republican U.S. senator, Joni Ernst.” CHRISTIE HAS HILLARY’S HIGH-FLYING HABITS NYT: “As Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey waited to depart on a trade mission to Israel in 2012, his entourage was delayed by a late arrival: Mr. Christie’s father, who had accidentally headed to the wrong airport. A commercial flight might have left without him, but in this case, there was no rush. The private plane, on which Mr. Christie had his own bedroom, had been lent by Sheldon G. Adelson, the billionaire casino owner and supporter of Israel… He has also quietly let others pay the bills. That tendency, the governor himself says he wants to ‘squeeze all the juice out of the orange,’ has put him in ethically questionable situations, taking benefits from those who stand to benefit from him.” Sound Off: 2016 Power Index - “Still think [Mitt Romney] would be best president but recognize that the media, conservative pundits and talk show hosts will not hear of this and would beat on him constantly were he to stay in. Given that, my next pick is Scott Walker. He appears to have a strong back bone, discipline and belief in fiscal conservatism. Only time will tell.” --Nancy Jewett “I like [Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis.] no nonsense approach- he does not seem to have any baggage and is not constrained to call them as he sees them!!! Refreshing in today's political world!!!!” – Thomas Flanagan “Though we haven't heard from him yet on the national stage, I continue to like John Kasich. Every chance I get I tell folks about his common-sense sound and how he's been doing well in Ohio (a not-so-red state). RUN, JOHN, RUN!!” –Tom Saunders “For a man who has the courage of honest, American, truthful, do what is right and Godly convictions, who will do what is RIGHT instead of what is political and expedient - Ben Carson.” – Jim Magwood WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... “But February made me shiver. With every paper I’d deliver, bad news on the doorstep. I couldn’t take one more step,” say the lines from Don McLean’s first epic Baby Boomer coming of age saga. And it was, in fact, this day in 1959 that “the music died” when Buddy Holly, J.P. “The Big Bopper” Richardson, and Ritchie Valens all perished in a plane crash en route to Fargo, N.D.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has unveiled a bill to repeal ObamaCare. National Review: “[Cruz’s] ‘Obamacare Repeal Act’ that would repeal the Affordable Care Act ‘as if such Act had not been enacted.’ The text of Cruz’s bill to repeal the 2,700-page law, which spawned another 10,000 pages of regulations, barely runs onto the third page. It comes as Republicans have debated whether to use a procedural tactic that circumvents filibusters known as reconciliation to repeal the legislation…The bill is co-sponsored by 44 Senate Republicans, including [McConnell]… and several leading members of the Obamacare working group that is mulling the GOP’s possible response to a major anti-Obamacare lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court.” [In WashEx, Byron York examines how ObamaCare will cause headaches for Democrats in the 2016 presidential race.] SENATE DEMS PREPARE TO OBSTRUCT IMMIGRATION PLAN With just 25 days until the agency runs out of money, the first major funding fight comes to a head today as the Senate takes up DHS funding bill. Roll Call: “Democrats are planning to block proceeding to a House-passed Homeland Security appropriations bill that would also negate President Barack Obama’s executive action on immigration. It’s a turnabout from a few months ago, when Democrats were in charge and railed against Republicans whenever they would vote to block debate on a bill…. ‘It seems our Republican colleagues are willing to shut down the government despite the fact that we have such security needs here in this country,’ [Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.] said. ‘They dislike DREAMers more than they dislike ISIS, and it’s just unbelievable.’” Tick, tick, tick - David Drucker lays out the legislative timeline, stressing how delivery and passage of a sound budget is where the rubber meets the road for Republicans: “[T]o take Obama on and make the case that smaller governments and freer markets are better, Congressional Republicans have to pass their own budget resolution showing their own funding priorities. That means at least 218 Republicans in the House, and 51 in the Senate, are going to have to agree on a plan.”] Battered Reid seeks to reclaim clout - Las Vegas Review-Journal: “A still battered-looking Sen. Harry Reid [D-Nevada] made a return to the Senate floor on Monday, and immediately jumped into a fray over immigration and homeland security…” [Watch Fox: Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest on the DHS funding battle.] TARGETING SCANDAL FRONT AND CENTER FOR IRS BOSS Hill sources tell Fox News that a hearing at the Senate Finance Committee today with IRS Commissioner Jon Koskinen could bring a major revelation about the agency’s missing emails relating to the scandal surrounding the agency’s targeting of President Obama’s political enemies. Koskinen’s appearance follows a week in which Congress has raised concerns over the embattled agency’s handling of ObamaCare subsidies, and whether taxpayer information may have been shared with political operatives in the White House. [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on the IRS budget clash from Capitol Hill.] [Obama wants big funding boost for IRS - The Hill: “The president’s new budget calls for giving the IRS $12.9 billion in fiscal 2016, roughly an 18 percent increase over the $10.9 billion that Congress approved for the agency in the current fiscal year.”] WHITE HOUSE, RED FACE In passing along president Obama’s mistaken claim that George Washington had lived and made “booze” at the White House, Fox News First mistakenly claimed Thomas Jefferson was the first president to inhabit the executive mansion. But as astute readers Paul Ruby, Ron Gay, Joan Nugent, John W. Gibson and Alan Mizelle pointed out, President John Adams spent the final five months of his term in the still-unfinished home. Like President Obama, we should have done our homework! CARB PANIC It must not have been his “cheat day.” WCAU reports that a man in the Philadelphia suburb of Upper Darby faced police questioning after sounding his apartment building’s fire alarm because of a clogged commode. But it was the circumstances of the plumbing problem that caused the most questions. The man, who was not identified by authorities, had apparently tried to flush multiple potatoes. After his toilet clogged, he reportedly called the building’s maintenance department several times. When help did not come soon enough, police say he pulled the building’s fire alarm. The fire department then evacuated the three-story building to investigate. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “Look, I don’t mind if the President sends a budget which he knows is not going to achieve anything. But when he prefaces his remarks as we just saw by saying we have to put politics aside, posing again as the one person in the country who rises above partisanship and party, speaks for the national interest, it’s really grating.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"Buzz Cut: • Obama controls Clinton’s fate in email scandal • Dems anxious for alternative • Glass ceiling high, hard • Q poll: Walker, Bush top tight GOP race • Is there an emoji for jail?","961","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/05/obama-controls-clintons-fate-in-email-scandal.html"
"OBAMA CONTROLS CLINTON’S FATE IN EMAIL SCANDAL Hillary Clinton said she wants “the public to see [her] email” in a tweet so Clintonian in its tortured language that it would have been perfect for a #throwbackthursday. The presumptive Democratic nominee most certainly does not want the public to see her “email,” which is why she built and maintained a secret server that risked massive security breaches but was designed to allow the eradication of any troublesome messages. That the server may have been overseen by a longtime aide with ties to the Clintons’ pardon scandal only makes the nostalgia more poignant. Pop in a Spin Doctors’ CD and let the 90s vibe flow, America. The former secretary of state is actually referring to emails she has already given the agency. Clinton’s campaign team would obviously have no qualms about releasing what has been already sterilized. But blaming the scandal on a bureaucratic snag beyond her control is an effort to inculpate the Obama administration. Team Obama, however, is fighting back. “That is why Doritos doesn’t get to decide which ingredients consumers need to know about, or why you don’t get to tell the cops which pocket to search.” – Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show.” Out on the ledge - AP reports today that the White House counsel’s office did not know Clinton was relying on private email servers and did so against the instructions she had been given. This comes after administration figures on Wednesday stepped gingerly away from the whole controversy, declaring their own electronic hygiene immaculate but leaving unanswered questions about Clinton’s potential misdeeds. It seems unlikely that Republican-led efforts to extract Clinton’s old emails will be fruitful. After all, if she is guilty of what her accusers allege, why would she suddenly get religion and cough up incriminating emails? What would be the point of breaking the rules and having a shady “homebrew” server if only to dump the data at the moment most damaging? But if the Obama administration were to decide to get serious, this could be the beginning of the end for Clinton’s second presidential campaign. Did someone say “special prosecutor?” “The bigger concern is was she transacting official government business that’s on a server that’s not secure? Because we know these servers are targets for foreign intelligence. We know the Chinese, the Russians, the North Koreans, the Cubans and others are constantly trying to hack into computers and especially that of government officials and if she was transacting sensitive State Department business on an insecure server, that alone is reason to be alarmed.” –Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on “The Kelly File” Dems anxious for alternative - WaPo: “Democratic activists in early presidential nominating states say that new controversies swirling around Hillary Rodham Clinton have made them more eager than ever for alternatives in 2016. The undercurrent of anxiety about Clinton’s vulnerabilities has grown in recent days with potentially damaging news of foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and the former secretary of state’s use of private email accounts to conduct official business.” [A new Quinnipiac Poll, taken before the controversy broke over Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email account as secretary of state, showed the Democratic frontrunner maintaining a 42 point lead over her closest competitor. Without Clinton in the race, Democratic voters polled give Vice President Joe Biden the lead at 35 percent, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 25 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 7 percent.] “There’s always another shoe to drop with Hillary… ‘I’ll tell you this: [Joe Biden] ain’t got no e-mail problems. He ain’t got no foundation problems. What you see with Joe is what you get. There’s nothing hidden there.’” -- Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina in an interview with WaPo. Heh - “Our Constitution is being shredded. We know about the secret wiretaps, we know about the secret military tribunals, the secret White House email accounts…It is a stunning record of secrecy and corruption, of cronyism run amok. It is everything our founders were afraid of, everything our Constitution was designed to prevent.” – Hillary Clinton in a 2007 jeremiad against the Bush administration. [Former Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., led a years-long effort against Karl Rove and others in the Bush administration over private emails. He sees things differently this time, though, telling Buzzfeed that while “he believed that she should turn all those records over there was a ‘distinction, though, between the presidency of the United States and other people in government.’”] Splatter paint - There has been a slew of reporting in the past three days on the electronic hygiene of Republican Sixteeners and the use of private email accounts. Rick Perry got some. Scott Walker too. While Jeb Bush got some sneers for having a private email server, his decision to preemptively dump his emails last month is looking wiser by the day as he seems to have broader latitude than any of his rivals to whack Clinton for her dubious digital conduct. Glass ceiling high, hard - Weekly Standard: “In late February, Hillary Clinton, a self-proclaimed champion of women’s rights and gender equity, came under fire for a Washington Free Beacon analysis that showed women on Mrs. Clinton’s staff during her tenure in the Senate were paid an average of 72 cents on the dollar compared to male staff. Now, an analysis of the latest IRS filing for the foundation that bears her name, the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, shows a similar compensation disparity between men and women employees. Although compensation figures are available for only a limited number of Foundation personnel, the 2013 Form 990 filed with the IRS shows that out of eleven highly compensated individuals listed, the top eight are all men.” LET’S PLAY HARDBALL Kathleen Matthews, chief global communications and public affairs officer for Marriot International and wife of MSNBC's Chris Matthews, is planning to run for the seat of Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Politico reports. Van Hollen announced Wednesday that he will vie for the seat being vacated by Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski.","962","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/05/obama-controls-clintons-fate-in-email-scandal.html"
"THE JUDGE’S RULING: OBAMA GONE ROGUE Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano examines the constitutionality of separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches. “What’s going on is the exercise of authoritarian impulses by a desperate president terrified of powerlessness and irrelevance, the Constitution be damned.

"Walker opposed to Homeland funding retreat - Pointing to Gov. Walker’s inclusion in a lawsuit by 26 states that has put the brakes on President Obama’s temporary amnesty for illegal immigrants, spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski told Breitbart News: “He hopes to prevail through the courts but he believes that the Congress needs to preserve the power of the purse to fight this overreach by the President. Democrats have questioned the president’s overreach in the past but didn’t hold him accountable when given the opportunity.” Rubio dips out on Iowa ethanol event - Des Moines Register: “U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is canceling plans to attend this weekend's Iowa Ag Summit, he told the Des Moines Register on Wednesday. Rubio, a Florida Republican and likely candidate for president in 2016, had RSVP’d for the event, but is backing out now to attend a family wedding. ‘I feel terrible about it, we really wanted to be a part of it,’ Rubio said in an interview Wednesday morning. ‘We really thought logistically we were going to be able to get back but we just can’t do it. I can't miss the wedding.’ Rubio said he may send a video that can be played during the summit.” Cruz hires Iowa social conservative operative - Des Moines Register: “Sen. Ted Cruz has added a staffer with ties to Iowa conservative groups and campaigns to his national political action committee. Bryan English will join Cruz’s Jobs Growth and Freedom PAC as a senior adviser, a source familiar with the hire confirmed…English is the former director of communications and public relations for the Iowa Family Policy Center. During his tenure, the group led the 2010 campaign to oust three Iowa Supreme Court justices after the legalization of gay marriage.” [Book tour - AP: “Sen. Ted Cruz's book, ‘A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Miracle of America,’ is coming out this summer. HarperCollins Publishers told The Associated Press on Thursday that it has set a June 30 release date for the book, for which Cruz reached a reported seven-figure deal last year.”] Rand looks to make peace with Adelson - NYT: “Rand Paul said Wednesday that he met with the Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson this week while Mr. Adelson was in Washington for a congressional address by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Mr. Paul and Mr. Adelson are not especially close, personally or in their world views. Mr. Adelson, a staunch supporter of Israel, favors a robust, activist military policy. Mr. Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky and a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has advocated a more restrained approach overseas. In an interview on the radio program ‘Jewish Moments in the Morning,’ Mr. Paul said that Mr. Adelson had assured him he would not fund an effort by Republicans to defeat him.” Sea Island Spectacular - The 2015 American Enterprise Institute World Forum kicks off today in Sea Island, Georgia. The three day event, with donors and bundlers in attendance, features speakers including Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Carson apologizes for comments on prison sex - Ben Carson posted an apology to Facebook for comments about gay sex in prisons. Carson restated his support for individual states to sanction or not sanction same-sex marriage. Carson also emphasizes that he is not a politician, and will err again, but unlike others will take full responsibility. IS THERE AN EMOJI FOR JAIL? Cincinnati Enquirer: “Andrew Dale Marcum, 21, of Lemon Township, achieved local internet celebrity Monday when he publicly defended himself against allegations from the Butler County Sheriff’s Office in a Monday Facebook post. However, tipsters learned of Marcum because of that defense, and they helped lead police to him less than 24 hours later. … The [Sherriff’s] post contained information and pictures of Marcum, who is associated with alleged burglary and safe cracking, abduction, assault, domestic violence, criminal endangering and some bench warrants….A Facebook account bearing the name ‘Andrew Marcum’ and featuring a profile picture consistent with Butler County mugshots was first to comment on the post: ‘I ain’t tripping half of them don’t even know me.’ The exchange took another turn hours later when the operators of the Butler County Sheriff's Office Facebook account responded: ‘Andrew Marcum - if you could stop by the Sheriff's Office, that’d be great.’” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is the same old Clinton that we know, and I think the reason that it hurts her is because we've seen the movie before throughout the 90s. The Clintons aren't just entitled, they also have a sense that they are to be protected in a way no one else is. Then they end up, when they're accused of either violating the law or the practice, making distinctions that are...I mean, the adjective Clintonian was invented for these fine distinctions, between legal and illegal, proper and improper.

"ATTACKS ON AUTHOR INDICATE CLINTON CONCERN The Clinton campaign is starting up its siege engine to shut down a book that levels a damning charge against the presumptive Democratic nominee: That as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton traded favors for cash that help take her from “dead broke” to enormous wealth. As with the two most recent scandals to hit the candidate – dubious donations to her family foundation and her destruction of more than 30,000 emails from her time at the state department – the campaign is deploying far and wide to knock down the charges. This time, though, the effort is aimed at discrediting the accuser, writer Peter Schweizer. Pressed on the campaign trail, Clinton refused to answer questions about the allegations, saying instead that “distractions and attacks” were part of running for office. In Clintonese, that’s a strong indication that there’s serious concern. [BuzzFeed: “Clinton will attend the first fundraisers of the campaign later this month. There will be one event on April 28 in New York City, and one on April 30 in Washington, D.C…..”] On Monday, campaign Chairman John Podesta told columnist Al Hunt that Schweitzer was “a former Bush operative who’s a reporter for that august news institution, breitbart.com.” Today, David Brock, the head of Clinton’s opposition research shop, went on MSNBC for an even more thorough thrashing of Schweizer, accusing him of anti-gay bigotry for a prior book about Walt Disney and alleging that Schweizer was in the employ of the Koch brothers. He then accused the New York Times of “outsourc[ing] its journalism” to Rupert Murdoch because the Times, like the Washington Post and Fox News, had been given advance access to the book to check its claims. But the focus of the Clinton effort is to discredit Schweizer, who, despite his conservative associations, has a reputation for solid reporting, worked for NBC News and has laid the wood to Republicans in the past. Campaign chairman shies on releasing health records - In his interview with Hunt, Podesta laid down a couple of markers: Clinton would debate her challengers and disclose her tax returns since the last run. But on health records, the top Clintoniasta stopped short. Asked if Clinton, who once famously delayed her congressional testimony on the Benghazi attacks because of a fall that left her with a concussion, a blood clot in her head and the need to wear special glasses, would release her medical records, Podesta ducked: “She'll have a release that's consistent with what a lot people have done in practice, which is people will know that she's in very good health, and there'll be reassurance from her doctors that the -- when it's appropriate.” [Podesta shrugged off questions on when Clinton would submit to her first post-announcement interview saying that she “took a few questions in Iowa.” Podesta was referring to inquires like this NBC “exclusive.”] Podesta: Hillary ‘restored America’s place in the world’ - Asked about Clinton’s alleged lack of accomplishments, Podesta was ready with a list: “She put together that sanctions package that's led to at least the possibility of having a deal on the Iran nuclear program. … She restored America's place in the world… She engineered a pivot to Asia -- the so-called pivot to Asia. Her first trip was to China.

"Ed Henry wants to know… “When will Hillary Clinton and her aides get more specific in refuting the serious allegations of quid pro quo in the new book ""Clinton Cash""? As she wraps up her second campaign swing today here in New Hampshire, Clinton still has not done a single interview -- lest she be asked about the book, the Clinton Foundation, and the deleted emails. Yesterday here on the trail Clinton did, in fact, her first ""press availability"" where she answered questions about the book. But the answers were broad, allowing her to try and stay on message about the middle class by dismissing the charges as a ""distraction"" from real issues for voters. Worth noting she did not get specific about denying favors for Clinton Foundation donors -- and neither did White House spokesman Josh Earnest, who got a series of questions at the podium. But a senior adviser to Clinton told me the campaign is prepared to refute the specific allegations by author Peter Schweizer. They claim to be waiting until more details spill out around the May 5 publication date and then, the adviser promises, the campaign will ""fight fire with fire"" so stay tuned.” - Ed Henry. Clinton distances from Obama on trade deal - President Obama’s proposed trade deal has put the squeeze on Hillary Clinton as she plays up to a Democratic left angry with the deal. Clinton says she’ll be “watching closely” for a crackdown on currency manipulation and Obama should be “willing to walk away” from a deal that doesn’t protect workers and strengthen national security. In response to pushback from top Democrats, a senior White House official told Fox News Monday, “Addressing currency is a top priority of the President, and we have made significant progress in ensuring all countries play fairly….We are opposed to enforceable currency disciplines because of the risk they create to our ability to create jobs and protect our economy.” [Former President Bill Clinton speaks at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. today on his time in public service.

It all started when he was invited to a party by a coworker in the early-1990s. The music playing at the party was bootlegged from the plant and he realized that, despite the company’s theft policy, there was a profitable operation selling pirated CDs. Glover was a technology aficionado and used his knowledge, and newfound profit, to change the business model. By the early 2000s, Glover had state-of-the-art equipment, and was leaking best-selling albums over the Internet regularly. As lawsuits against Napster, and other music-sharing sites came and went Glover continued his operation undisturbed. How did he do it? And how did he get caught? Dive into the New Yorker’s long read.

The concept, in development for months as the former Florida governor has raised tens of millions of dollars for his Right to Rise super PAC, would endow that organization not just with advertising on Bush's behalf, but with many of the duties typically conducted by a campaign. Should Bush move ahead as his team intends, it is possible that for the first time a super PAC created to support a single candidate would spend more than the candidate's campaign itself — at least through the primaries…. “The architects of the plan believe the super PAC's ability to raise unlimited amounts of money legally outweighs its primary disadvantage, that it cannot legally coordinate its actions with Bush or his would-be campaign staff. … Right to Rise could also break into new areas for a candidate-specific super PAC, such as data gathering, highly individualized online advertising and running phone banks. Also on the table: tasking the super PAC with crucial campaign endgame strategies: the operation to get out the vote and efforts to maximize absentee and early voting on Bush's behalf. “The campaign itself would still handle those things that require Bush's direct involvement, such as candidate travel. It would still pay for advertising, conduct polling and collect voter data. …Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said: “Any speculation on how a potential campaign would be structured, if he were to move forward, is premature at this time.’” [Bush is on starts day two of his Northwest fundraising tour. He attends two dinners at the homes of Portland, Ore. donors.] Mike Murphy said to be at the helm - National Journal reports that longtime Bush adviser and former strategist for John McCain, Mitt Romney and Arnold Schwarzenegger will be leading the super PAC that will make or break Bush’s campaign. Jeb heads for Europe in June - Miami Herald: “Jeb Bush plans to visit Germany, Poland and Estonia in early June as he continues his all-but-declared 2016 Republican presidential campaign. Among other things, the former Florida governor plans to speak at an economic conference organized by Germany's ruling party, the Christian Democratic Union, a Bush aide said. His trip was first reported by Reuters. In Poland and Estonia, Bush will meet with government and business representatives as well as civic and charity groups.” CLEANUP ON AISLE SIX: KOCHS NOT BACKING WALKER… YET The NYT reported that conservative industrialist David Koch all but endorsed Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin for the GOP nomination after Walker gave a bravura performance to big donors at New York’s Union League Club on Monday. Then Koch and the conservative network he founded and helps fund with brother Charles, hurried to clarify. The network revealed to Politico that yes, it might play in the GOP primary process but that Walker was not necessarily the choice. Walker being branded as the Kochs’ man, especially so early, would be bad for Walker. It would also hurt the conservative network’s ability to raise money from other mega-donors who might be backing other candidates. The plan, as told to Politico, is instead to wait and hold another forum for candidates this summer like the one the network hosted in January. Summer auditions set - The attendees from the original conclave, Walker and Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz will be invited back along with establishment fave Jeb Bush. The stated goal is to avoid a repeat of the last cycle when a series of conservative candidates successively failed against establishment pick Mitt Romney. From the article: “‘It was a fait accompli,’ the aide said. ‘Do you help out, or not? Relative to Obama? Sure. Do you want to be faced with that choice again? Probably not.’” “One thing [other candidates are] not saying: We need to make sure…that, any future legal immigration system…has to account for American citizens and workers in this country…even with legal immigration, we respond in a way that doesn’t take jobs from hard working Americans.” – Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., on “The Kelly File.” Conservative groups back Koch crusade against Ex-Im bank - The Hill: “More than 50 conservative groups sent a letter to lawmakers on Monday urging them to not to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. … Americans For Prosperity helped organize the letter, which was also signed by Americans For Tax Reform, the Club For Growth, Freedom Partners and FreedomWorks.” POLL: GOP FIELD TIGHT, ALL LAG HILLARY CNN: “Overall, 17% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents back Bush for the GOP nomination, while 12% support Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Paul and Rubio stand at 11% each, with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 9% and Cruz at 7%. Former neurosurgeon Ben Carson and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, both of whom placed second in CNN/ORC polls as recently as last fall, are now well behind the leader at 4% each. … Marco Rubio fares best against the former first lady, trailing Clinton by 14 points, 55% to 41%. Bush trails Clinton by 17 points, 56% to 39%. Christie and Paul fall 19 points behind Clinton, each putting up 39% to Clinton's 58%. Huckabee, Walker, Carson and Cruz each trail Clinton by more than 20 points.” HISPANIC DONORS EYE BUSH, RUBIO, CRUZ WashEx’s David Drucker, notes this election offers Hispanic Republican donors and bundlers “their first opportunity to support one of their own for president… The dilemma is figuring out in whom to invest:”… “In Bush and Rubio, they see candidates who in tone and policy will project a Republican Party that is more welcoming to ethnic minorities. Hispanic donors and bundlers, as interested in teaming with a winner as any other campaign financier, also see in them candidates that can beat presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Cruz is still a value-add, contributing to a cast of GOP candidates more diverse than anything the Democrats ever fielded.”","1030","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/21/attacks-on-author-indicate-clinton-concern.html"

The deal unveiled on the Senate floor aimed to solve a dispute over abortion that has stalled the once-popular trafficking bill for weeks. Attorney General-designate Loretta Lynch was caught in the crossfire, infuriating Democrats, because Republican leaders decided to hold off on her confirmation vote until the trafficking bill was resolved….The deal aims to address Democratic concerns that the legislation expands existing prohibitions on spending federal funds on abortions. Republicans had to be satisfied that those prohibitions were not curtailed.” Lynch looks to squeak by - The Hill: “Five Senate Republicans have announced their support for Lynch, giving her the minimum 51 votes she needs to be confirmed. The Republicans supporting Lynch’s nomination are Sens. Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) — all members of the Judiciary Committee — and moderate Sens.

Cindy Vong, who has operated a nail salon in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert since 2006, introduced the treatment in 2008. She imported fish from China and remodeled her business to create a separate fish spa area. In 2009, Vong was told by the Arizona Board of Cosmetology that the treatment violated the agency's safety standards, and that she could face criminal charges.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"INTRODUCING THE DEMOCRATIC 2016 POWER INDEX Fox News First has been ranking the Republican presidential contenders in our Power Index since January, but left the Democrats out of the mix. Why waste our time and yours on what was shaping up as a coronation? But the ongoing and far-from-finished scandal around Hillary Clinton’s use of a secret home email server as secretary of state casts things in a new light. We have much more on the scandal below, but the political takeaway is fairly straightforward: her cloak of inevitability is torn. Whether as an actual rival or as a life raft for their party’s presidential hopes should Clinton sink herself, Democrats increasingly want and need alternatives. And so, we give you our inaugural Democratic 2016 Power Index. 1) HILLARY CLINTON","1037","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/09/introducing-democratic-2016-power-index-email-flap-puts-field-in-play.html"
"Today is a perfect encapsulation of Clinton’s campaign: big resources that bring big troubles. Clinton’s controversial family foundation will be acting as an extension of her campaign as it celebrates a speech Clinton gave 20 years ago in China on women’s rights with a dense report, public events and speeches by the candidate. Of course, since the foundation funds its work partly through gifts from countries that repress women as part of official policy, it does get a little icky. She will again be appearing in public but again failing to address the email scandal beyond an impossibly Clintonian tweet on the topic. So she gets a huge boost on visibility on her central campaign theme – that it’s time for a female president – but the means by which she paid for the platform create controversy of their own. [“What I would like, is for her to come forward and say just what the situation is because she is the preeminent political figure right now. I think from this point on the silence is going to hurt her.” – Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”] 2) JOE BIDEN The vice president is kind of a hot mess. He boldly makes untrue statements. He nape-nuzzles other men’s wives in public. He’s 72, but lacks any of the campaign discipline that decades in public life ought to have brought him. And yet, he’s the single biggest threat to Hillary Clinton and the automatic frontrunner if he decides to run. Aside from having Air Force Two and near-universal name recognition, he can make the best claim to Democrats for protecting and defending President Obama’s legacy. And plus, the press loves Biden, a negative since his every gaffe would be amplified but a positive since he would have the best platform to call Clinton out. The two were consistently at odds during their time in the administration, and he would surely make a potent prosecutor of her claims of foreign policy expertise. [The Atlantic: “There’s only one prominent Democratic contender who has traveled to all three early presidential primary states so far in 2015. It’s not Hillary Clinton. Nor is it Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or even Martin O’Malley.”] 3) ELIZABETH WARREN The freshman senator from Massachusetts says she’s not running for president, but she and thousands of her supporters say they just want Hillary Clinton to move to the left and be a “progressive warrior.” But that’s an empty threat without the means to punish Clinton if she doesn’t oblige. Warren, who has had an audience with the frontrunner, has shown a reticence to run beyond coyness in recent weeks. It is helpful to appear not overly ambitious, but too much resistance will cause supporters to look elsewhere. Warren boasts the advantage of a campaign in waiting, but time is running out for her to make a long-shot run. While she might do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, to avoid being road-kill under the Clinton machine in the rest of the primaries, Warren needs to get busy. If she can get rolling, though, her zeal and authenticity could make her the Democratic heartthrob in a flash. Unlike Biden, Warren would also be a history-making nominee. [Union label - Warren and Biden both address the International Association of Firefighters today in Washington.] 4) MARTIN O’MALLEY You can’t win the game if you don’t suit up and show up, and therein lies former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley’s cardinal advantage as a candidate. Unlike the others, he is actually on the trail and looking for donors and support. O’Malley is little known and isn’t broadly identified with any particular message, but as the very liberal former governor of a very liberal state, he has many policy points to please Democrats unhappy about the idea of veering from Obama’s domestic doctrine. Campaigning in New Hampshire this weekend, O’Malley demurred when questioned about Clinton’s sketchy email account. If O’Malley wants to be more than a running-mate in waiting, he will have to draw deeper distinctions with the frontrunner to show he’s serious. 5) JIM WEBB Candidates who are running against their parties don’t usually fare well, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb looks to be no exception. Webb’s cry is that Democrats have to restore faith with the blue-collar white voters who once were the party’s backbone. And while he has a point to make about economic populism, and the deep embrace by Clinton of Wall Street, on the rest of the party’s issue set, he is a man out of time. Whether it is abortion or gun rights, Democrats made their collective choice against the party’s former base decades ago and won’t be coming back. Over the horizon - Suppose Hillary Clinton actually imploded and dropped out of the race. Who else might consider a run and could reasonably get a campaign together on the double. Some names to watch would include Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Gov. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y.

In fact, we have no emails from that trip,’ Gowdy said…” On your own, Hill - ""If they screwed up on the emails, if we find out they skipped over her emails . . . then that will be a problem for them, it’ll be a scandal. But it’s not one that we’ll own."" – “a senior administration official” speaking to the WSJ. News to him - President Obama said he first learned of Clinton’s private e-mail use, “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.” Obama defended Clinton in an interview with CBS stating, “The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails — the BlackBerry I carry around — all those records are available and archived, and I’m glad that Hillary’s instructed that those e-mails about official business need to be disclosed.” [Watch Fox: Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest on the Clinton e-mails] GOP 2016 POWER INDEX: JEB NEEDS CONSERVATIVE CRACKUP; KASICH RISING; CARSON FADES His first Iowa foray behind him, Jeb Bush has further solidified his position as the party’s establishment choice and the frontrunner for 2016. Jeb’s tougher push and the biggest threat to his overall nomination remains winning over the social conservative and libertarian wing of the party. A point that stretches beyond Iowa’s corn fields and is underlined in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which found a divide among conservative GOP primary voters with “48% saying that could see themselves backing Mr. Bush and 45% saying they couldn’t.” But the biggest concern for Bush remains the durability (so far) of conservative support for Gov. Scott Walker. To win, Bush needs conservatives divided in their loyalties and for his potential top rivals to keep pulling each other down the ladder. [Des Moines Register: “Bush did six events plus several one-on-one meetings in two markets — Des Moines and Cedar Rapids — in 24 hours. He turned some heads on Friday and Saturday, describing himself as the most successful conservative governor in Florida history and saying his record of accomplishment ‘is what's necessary right now for our country to get back on track’”] Iowa’s March Madness - National Journal provides a nifty visualization of the GOP’s 2016 field that illustrates how Iowa voters who look favorably on one candidate view the rest of the field and what this means to candidates’ strategies: “[C]andidates start out fighting to emerge as the front-runner among a smaller subgroup—in some ways like college basketball teams fighting their way through one side of a tournament bracket before the finals.

John Kasich, calling him “the stuff of conservative dreams,” with a “tendency toward contrarianism:” “If the governor does eventually plunge into the race, one thing seems guaranteed: He would be, by a large margin, the Republican field's most provocative voice. No, he likely wouldn’t win, and he might well get the snot kicked out of him. But more than any other underdog flirting with 2016, John Kasich—defiant, outspoken, critical of conservatism from within—could upend the tenor of the primary season. [Calendar of a candidate - Kasich will be making stops in South Carolina and New Hampshire at the end of the month. Columbus [Ohio] Dispatch: “Kasich said he plans to attend the Detroit Economic Club — a forum that hosted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush a month ago — and the 21 Club in midtown Manhattan — which heard from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker a couple of weeks ago and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry in January.”] Cruz and Perry resist pandering on corporate welfare - [Fort Worth] Star-Telegram: “Texas Sen. [Ted Cruz’s] and former Gov. [Rick Perry’s]… messages at the Iowa Ag Summit were occasionally at odds with what some members of the audience wanted to hear… Cruz, a Republican, was the most blunt when [Iowa ethanol mogul Bruce Rastetter] asked him about the Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets a minimum amount of biofuels that must be blended into the gasoline supply. ‘The answer you’d like to me to give is I’m for the RFS,’ Cruz told Rastetter. ‘That’d be a pretty easy thing to do.’ But Cruz, who has called for phasing out the RFS program over five years, said Americans are fed up with ‘career politicians’ who pander to voters, especially in places like Iowa, with its outsized role in the presidential nominating process. Perry was equally unapologetic for his opposition to the RFS, saying he has no regrets about unsuccessfully seeking a federal waiver from the mandate as governor during a corn-sapping drought a few years ago in Texas.” Kentucky GOP gives OK to Rand’s caucus plan - AP: “Kentucky Sen.

Did you commute to work in the dark again? Not surprising since the government mandated that you wake up an hour earlier this morning (and every day until Nov. 1). The rationale for the creation and expansion of Daylight Savings Time was to save energy. The original idea was said to be Ben Franklin’s, but it became part of the mainstream American experience under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Wilson famously tried to keep the regime in place after the war, but Congress overruled him, even overriding his veto. The practice returned during World War II and was maintained by some local governments after the war. The time-shifters fought and won a long battle, eventually pushing through legislation in 1966 that required states to adopt uniform standards and gave the federal government authority over starting and stopping Daylight Savings Time. Today, every state except Arizona and Hawaii obeys. But does it work? Nope. WaPo passes along a study from time-zone-crazy Indiana that revealed that the shift wastes energy. Why? Because whatever electricity people are saving by having more sunlight in the evening is outstripped by the energy used for heating in the chillier, earlier mornings and cooling in the evening.

"NEW CORRUPTION CLAIMS SNARE CLINTON INSIDERS Investigators say a former Clinton appointee, now in a key post at the Department of Homeland Security, improperly intervened on cases that benefitted presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s brother, Tony Rodham, her former campaign chairman and other key Democratic donors. This is the second recent revelation of unseemly conduct inside Clinton’s universe. The other involves Rodham tapping the connections from his sister’s problematic family foundation to get in on a controversial gold mine in disaster-wracked Haiti. The Obama administration is sticking by embattled Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Even so, the report is sure to deepen questions about the contents of the tens of thousands of emails from her time as secretary of state that Clinton said she destroyed in the interest of protecting her privacy. Power Play: Dems’ false hope for phony primary – Democrats don’t want anyone to beat Hillary Clinton, but they would like a symbolic contest to distract reporters from her ongoing problems, force her stake out liberal policies and tune up for the general election. Chris Stirewalt explains, in 60 seconds, how the Democrats are trying to drum up a “fake” primary. WATCH HERE. Hillary can blow off key issues in primary - NYT: “The last time she ran for president, Hillary Rodham Clinton did not have to take a position on the Common Core, Race to the Top or teacher evaluations in tenure decisions. She won the endorsement of one of the nation’s largest teachers’ unions in 2007 after deploring the use of standardized tests and the underfunding of the No Child Left Behind law by President George W. Bush’s administration… Her allies believe that with no strong primary opponent to force her into the open, Mrs. Clinton has plenty of time to maneuver before taking sides. But advocates will be using what leverage they possess to draw her out sooner.” More clout for Team Obama in Hillaryland - WaPo: “Teddy Goff, the digital director of President Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign, is advising the Clinton campaign-in-waiting on its digital strategy, while longtime Clinton aide Katie Dowd is on board to be the campaign’s digital director with Jenna Lowenstein as her deputy, according to several Democrats with knowledge of the moves.” CONGRESS SHRUGS OFF OBAMA LATHER OVER ISRAEL Daily Beast: “Mossad reportedly listened into nuclear talks and used the information to lobby Capitol Hill. Democrats and Republican greeted the news with a big shrug…. If anything, lawmakers said they were perturbed that the Israelis were being accused of spying—not that they did any actual surveillance. Learning the details of the nuclear talk, lawmakers argued, was less like ‘spying’ and more like information gathering…. ‘ I haven’t had any of them coming up and talking with me about where the deal is, so I was kind of wondering who it was they were meeting with. I kind of feel left out, if you know what I’m saying,…‘If you think about it, if the White House was doing the normal advise and consent [function] with the Senate, then it wouldn’t be necessary to get our information [elsewhere],’ said [Sen. Bob Corker].” “This can’t be reduced to a matter of somehow let’s all, you know, hold hands and sing ‘Kumbaya.’ This is a matter of figuring out how do we get through a real knotty policy difference that has great consequences for both countries and for the region.” – President Obama talking to reporters about his disapproval of Israel’s elected officials. Jeb weighs in against Iran deal, Israel slights - In an op-ed at National Review, GOP 2016 candidate Jeb Bush writes that nothing will sway President Obama on Israel and Iran, “It is clear that nothing, not public opinion, not opposition from his own party in Congress, and not even the facts, will deter President Obama from a potentially risky agreement that may well allow Iran to intimidate the entire Middle East, menace Israel, and, most of all, threaten America. This policy choice is a reflection of the way Obama has handled a range of foreign-policy matters. Instead of projecting American determination and leadership, he has either withdrawn from the stage or chosen to trust our enemies.” NATO boss snubbed too? - Bloomberg’s Josh Rogin reports: “President Barack Obama has yet to meet with the new head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and won't see Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg this week, even though he is in Washington for three days. Stoltenberg’s office requested a meeting with Obama well in advance of the visit, but never heard anything from the White House, two sources close to the NATO chief told me.” [Afghan President Ashraf Ghani will address a joint meeting of Congress today.] Google caches in on Obama access - WSJ: “Since Obama took office, employees of the Mountain View, Calif., company have visited the White House for meetings with senior officials about 230 times, or an average of roughly once a week, according to the visitor logs reviewed by the Journal.” DEMS PLEAD FOR ANOTHER OBAMACARE DELAY WashEx: “Six Democratic senators and one independent have asked the Department of Health and Human Services to a delay a new rule that would likely force small businesses to pay more for employee health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. The senators warn that if the administration goes ahead with the change it would be ‘particularly harmful and disruptive’ to small businesses. Starting in 2016, the Obamacare change will require businesses that employ between 51-100 people to purchase insurance in what the government defines as the ‘small group market,’ rather than the market for large group plans. The senators warn that the change will inflate health care costs for those businesses.” Irreconcilable differences - AP: “House and Senate Republicans steamed ahead Tuesday toward likely approval of balanced budget outlines, essential early steps along a path to send President Barack Obama legislation to wipe out his five-year-old health care law and eliminate deficits within a decade. Obama is all but certain to veto the follow-up legislation if and when it reaches his desk later this year, but Republican rebels and establishment-minded conservatives alike in the House paid that little mind… Senate Republicans forced a vote late...[Tuesday]...on Obama’s budget, which includes higher taxes on the wealthy and smokers, far more spending than Republicans favor and unending deficits…The plan failed, 98-1, with Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., casting the sole vote in its favor. A final vote was expected Wednesday on the House plan, and late Thursday or early Friday on the Senate's slightly different version.” COURT SETS DATE FOR EXECUTIVE AMNESTY SHOWDOWN A federal appeals court in New Orleans has set an April 17 hearing date to decide whether President Obama’s executive amnesty for as many as 5 million illegal immigrants should go into effect while the underlying legal battle continues. If the administration, which has been ramping up for months in preparation of the amnesty, can begin issuing work permits and other documents while the case drags on, it could render moot the so-far-successful effort by 26 states seeking to block the president’s actions. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... It took a while and there’s no one around to present a trophy, but for NASA, crossing the finish line of the inaugural Red Planet Marathon is reason for celebration. On Tuesday the Mars Rover, better known as Opportunity, marked an extraterrestrial milestone: covering a distance of 26.219 miles. The distance took approximately 11 years and two months to traverse. Late last year, Opportunity exceeded all long distance records set by off-Earth vehicles. Scientists working on the project are trying to keep their focus on the mission at hand, though Steve Squyres, Opportunity principal investigator at Cornell University said, “Still, running a marathon on Mars feels pretty cool.” Opportunity has far exceeded its original three month mission and as the rover continues to motor on, scientists have expanded research locations to explore on the Red Planet. To celebrate the marathon, the project team based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab is planning a marathon-length relay run of their own. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Bush showing up at campaign rallies for brother Jeb Bush anytime soon. While the elder Bush brother is attending a fundraiser for the younger Wednesday, it’s unlikely he’ll be able to overcome his liabilities and become a real asset for the growing campaign. … It’s still possible Jeb Bush can make his brother’s presidency a net gain. The Bush family has an extensive donor network. Jeb Bush has been working to reactivate that network, which generously contributed to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, to scare other likely Republican candidates out of the race. The ready-made donor infrastructure could ultimately render most of the GOP field unable to compete. Romney found that after raising historic totals in 2012, some donors were proving more loyal to the Bush family.” [Sagacious seer Josh Kraushaar lays out Jeb Bush’s nightmare scenario: A collapse of Giuliani-sized proportions.] CAN WALKER GET PAST GROWING PAINS? National Review’s Eliana Johnson reports: “[Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker] watchers have long questioned his ability to take his Wisconsin organization national. And his proto-presidential operation is in many ways a Wisconsin one: steering the ship are Keith Gilkes, who managed Walker’s 2010 campaign and his recall election, and served as the governor’s chief of staff during his first term in office; R. J. Johnson, Walker’s longtime campaign strategist; and Stephan Thompson, who served as deputy campaign manager for Walker’s 2010 bid and ran his 2014 campaign for reelection.”","1043","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/25/new-corruption-claims-snare-clinton-insiders.html"
"“According to several people who have worked with Walker over the years — most of whom requested anonymously to speak candidly — the central problem in the Walker organization is that the governor has long served as his own campaign strategist — and he’s obviously a good one. As a result, he’s never had to build a large team of political professionals and delegate to it. ‘He’s his own chief strategist, he’s his own speechwriter, he’s his own PR person,’ says a Wisconsinite who has known the governor since his days as a county executive. ‘That may work when you’re a county executive. It’s a little more problematic when you’re the governor of a state, but you absolutely can’t do that when you’re running for president.’” Picks up a top Romney staffer - AP: “Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is adding another senior staffer with national experience as his political operation grows ahead of a likely 2016 presidential run. The Republican governor's political action committee has tapped Matt Hall to serve as director of operations. Hall held a similar position for 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.” Walker, Jeb tied in N.H. poll - Scott Walker and Jeb Bush are in a statistical tie in a poll of N.H GOP voters by Gravis Marketing. With a margin of error of +/- 4 points, Walker leads at 19 percent to Bush’s 18 percent. “Unsure” is third at 16 percent. Chris Christie and Rand Paul follow, tied at 10 percent. Marco Rubio has 7 percent, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson tied at 6 percent. Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee drew 4 percent each, with Rick Santorum at 1 percent. [Walker campaigns in Phoenix today] CRUZ TAKES SHOT AT WIFE’S WALL STREET FIRM Bloomberg: “One day after announcing himself as presidential candidate, Texas Senator Ted Cruz fired a few shots across the bow of Wall Street, and the firm that employs his wife as managing director. In an interview with Bloomberg’s With All Due Respect, Cruz was asked by host Mark Halperin whether, on balance, Goldman Sachs was a positive or a negative force on society. ‘Like any institution, there’s some of both,’ Cruz responded, adding, ‘Goldman is one of the biggest banks on Wall Street, and my criticism with Washington is they engage in crony capitalism. … I think big business, if they’re building a better mousetrap, great, but it shouldn’t be government favoring, and let me give you an example: Dodd-Frank. Sold to the American people as stopping ‘too-big-to-fail.’ What happened? The big banks have gotten bigger. Goldman has gotten bigger...’” Signs up for ObamaCare - Des Moines Register: “Ted Cruz, one of the loudest critics of Obamacare, will soon be using it for health insurance coverage. ‘We will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care, and we're in the process of transitioning over to do that,’ Cruz, a Republican candidate for president, told The Des Moines Register on Tuesday. Cruz’s wife, Heidi, is going on an unpaid leave of absence from her job at Goldman Sachs to join Cruz full time on the campaign trail, Cruz told the Register…” Says politics drove switch to country music - WaPo: “In an interview with CBS News Tuesday, Cruz said he grew up listening to classic rock, but became a country fan after 9/11 because of how musicians responded to the attacks. ‘I actually find this intellectually curious, but on 9/11, I didn't like how rock music responded, and country music collectively, the way they responded, it resonated with me, and I just have to say just at a gut level, I had an emotional reaction that said these are my people,’ he said.” “We’re both first-term senators…Both went to Harvard, but there are marked differences. In [Barack Obama’s] time in the Senate, he was basically a back-bencher, did not lead on any issues of real significance. And in my time in the Senate, there are a lot of faults I have, but nobody would accuse me of being a back-bencher.” –Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on “The Kelly File” Watch here. KASICH CONFRONTS HIS PARTY ON COMMON CORE, IMMIGRATION New Hampshire Union Leader: “Ohio Gov. John Kasich, in New Hampshire exploring a run for President, said a factor in his consideration is whether he can be a true contender this time. He likened his run in 2000 to running into a wall and not making a dent. The Republican said the ideal nominee in 2016 will be someone who ‘isn’t going to play hard-core, partisan politics’ and can unite the country in the ‘same way we’ve done it in Ohio.’ Kasich, in an interview Tuesday with the New Hampshire Union Leader, confronted two issues with sharp partisan edges for some in his party: Common Core and immigration reform…He also touted the importance of a balanced budget amendment, and a convention of states to amend the Constitution to achieve it. ‘I am shocked that there are Republicans who just somehow think that this discipline is going to be imposed on Congress. It’s mind-boggling to me,’ he said.” [Kasich will deliver remarks to economists today in Manhattan at the 21 Club following similar remarks by Gov. Scott Walker last month.] PERRY: IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT ‘YOUR LAST NAME IS’ Bloomberg: “Former Texas Governor Rick Perry sounded an awful lot like a candidate for president as he questioned U.S. policies on energy, immigration and education at a Bloomberg-sponsored forum in Houston. Perry also cited his blue-collar background and military service Tuesday, and said he could win Iowa and Pennsylvania's presidential nominating contests if he runs in what is expected to be a crowded Republican field in 2016. Whoever wins, it will have nothing to do with ‘what your last name is,’ Perry said, referring to pundits’ assertions that the White House will be won by another Bush or a Clinton” CHRISTIE HITS THE ROAD, LOOKING TO AVOID ELIMINATION AP: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is heading to Philadelphia to raise money for his political action committee - and protesters from New Jersey are following. Christie is scheduled to attend a fundraising reception for his Leadership Matters for America PAC Wednesday evening. … Christie has a busy few days of travel. He’ll go to Texas for fundraisers Thursday and deliver a speech at a Michigan Lincoln Day dinner Friday.” [New Hampshire Union Leader: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is confirmed as a speaker at the New Hampshire Republican Party’s ‘First in the Nation’ Leadership Summit on April 17-18.”] CARSON: OBAMA ‘LIKE MOST PSYCHOPATHS’ “Like most psychopaths. That’s why they’re successful. That’s the way they look. They all look great.” – Ben Carson quoted in a GQ profile regarding President Obama’s appearance during the State of the Union address. PRIMARY BATTLE MAY BE BREWING IN INDIANA The Indianapolis Star’s Tom LoBianco has the breakdown on the early frontrunners to replace retiring Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. The short list includes Coats’ state director, Eric Holcomb, a former state legislator, state party chairman and protégé of former Gov. Mitch Daniels. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., whom Coats edged out for the GOP nomination in 2010, may also be weighing a bid. With former Sen. Evan Bayh taking himself out of the running, Democrats will have to hope former Democratic Rep. Baron Hill or another potential candidate could take advantage of a GOP fumble like the one in 2012. BIG ENOS, LITTLE ENOS DEEMED PERSONS OF INTEREST With the recent news that the Ringling Brothers circus will eliminate elephants in its acts, two of the animals appear to have found work as first responders. The Natchitoches Parish, La. Sheriff’s Department responded to a call to assist with diverting traffic around an 18-wheeler obstructing an exit on Interstate 49. The tractor-trailer, which was transporting three elephants from Florida to Texas, had gotten stuck in the mud when the driver pulled off to the rain-soaked shoulder. The driver and trainer coaxed two of the animals out of the trailer to help prop up the tilted side of the trailer until a tow truck arrived. The department has helpfully provided photos of the pachyderms at work. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is not [Hamid Karzai], who insisted on tweaking and insulting the United States, and really sort of implying he was sympathetic with the Taliban. [Afghan President Ashraf Ghani] is a guy who is really very pro-American.

"DEM REVOLT BEGINS ON OBAMA AMNESTY After maintaining a weeks-long filibuster of a Republican bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security but roll back president Obama’s executive actions granting amnesty and work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, Senate Democrats are starting to splinter. Unable to break the Democratic logjam, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he would instead offer a standalone bill to block Obama’s amnesty gambit before resuming the funding fight. Appearing on “Fox & Friends,” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he would vote to “prevent the president from his executive action” and suggested that there might be the five other Democrats necessary to advance the legislation. “Well, this bill removes those excuses. It sets up a simple political equation: Either stand in defense of extreme overreach, or stand with constituents in support of shared democratic values.” –Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell in a floor speech today. Tick-tock - While Obama would almost certainly veto the bill, significant Democratic objections to his policies combined with the federal court ruling against the administration on the actions could start to shift the debate. The president will prove today that he doesn’t mind vetoing popular, bipartisan legislation as he spikes the bill approving an oil pipeline from Canada, but if there is a Democratic rebellion it is harder to argue that he is doing the will of the people. Plus, getting Democrats on the record as protecting the amnesty is always helpful to the GOP. But big questions remain. Can the House and Senate cough up an emergency, stopgap spending plan to keep the agency running while the debate plays out? The deadline is Friday and time is running out quickly. “The American people are demanding more than that and seeing through these antics which are designed to protect the president in his lawlessness in defiance of a constitutional system.” –Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, on “The Kelly File” Watch here. IN SLAP TO UNIONS, OBAMA TO CAN BIPARTISAN KEYSTONE BILL Fox News: “The Senate will send the Keystone XL pipeline bill to President Obama on Tuesday, senior congressional sources tell Fox News. … The House passed a final version of the bill about two weeks ago, but the sources told Fox New that leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress intentionally waited to send it to the White House. They purportedly wanted Congress, which last week was on break, to be in session if and when the president vetoes the bill so they can draw more attention to the issue.”","1048","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/24/dem-revolt-begins-on-obama-amnesty.html"
"“The White House’s recommendation of a veto has nothing to do with the aforementioned merits of the project. Instead, the administration claims the bill will ‘cut short’ the process for approving the project. We disagree. If anything, the process has been needlessly drawn out: more than 2,300 days have passed since the Keystone application was first filed. This level of delay is extreme, even for Washington. In fact, approving these types of pipelines was once routine.” –Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. in a USA Today op-ed. Hangover for Hillary – What does Hillary Clinton think about the pipeline project? She was seemingly for it before she went silent. In 2012, as her boss buoyed the green base with a further delay, one pipeline opponent observed: “She doubtless figures four years is a long time, and – even though it’s the one environmental issue in decades that’s brought big crowds of environmentalists into the streets – that voters will forget her stance on the pipeline.” But those years have come and gone and the issue is still alive, thanks to the president’s obduracy. Given the support the Clinton Foundation has reportedly received from Keystone proponents, greenies will demand answers from the presumptive Democratic nominee. That was then - “We’ve not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so…” –Hillary Clinton in a 2010 speech. This is now - “We have differences and you won't get me to talk about Keystone because I have steadily made clear that I'm not going to express an opinion. It is in our process and that’s where it belongs.” –Hillary Clinton to an audience in Canada on January, 21 2015.","1049","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/24/dem-revolt-begins-on-obama-amnesty.html"
"HILLARY RE-EMERGES FOR EVENT WITH CORPORATE BACKERS After not appearing before an American audience in more than two months and with questions swirling about foreign donations to her family foundation, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is back on the speaking circuit today. She’s on stage for a Silicon Valley gig touting the gender equality policies of some of her most influential corporate patrons. McClatchy: “Clinton will serve as the keynote speaker [today] at a conference sponsored by a series of major companies that have donated to her political campaigns or her family’s foundation, helped pay her hefty speaking fees at other events and lobbied her when she served as secretary of state. Some of their employees have been involved in her campaigns or initiatives at the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Many have multiple ties to the Clintons. “Cisco, a California networking-equipment company, donated thousands of dollars to Clinton through its political action committee, and its general counsel served as a bundler and a policy adviser for her 2008 presidential campaign. Ericsson, a Swedish communications company, donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the foundation, and its president participated in a group discussion at the related Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting last year. Morgan Stanley, a New York investment firm that’s Clinton’s sixth largest donor, spent at least $14 million lobbying the federal government, including the State Department, during her term on issues related to China, India and currency-exchange oversight, according to public records.” [WaPo: “For Clinton, the Bay Area represents perhaps her biggest opportunity to expand her fundraising base from 2008, when she raised $6.2 million from the affluent counties of San Francisco, Santa Clara and San Mateo, according to campaign finance data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Obama brought in $9.8 million from donors in those counties during the same time period.”] Campaign motif will be gender war – National Journal: “Already, recent words and actions hint at the ways [Hillary Clinton will] bring gender into the 2016 campaign—by talking about issues like pay equity, affordable child care, and paid family leave, referencing her past work for women and children, and gushing about her new granddaughter. That soft approach will be coupled with a sharp-edged assault by supporting organizations outside of her camp. Some of them, including the abortion-rights group EMILY's List and the Democratic National Committee, have begun playing offense against the Republican field, painting many of the 2016 GOP hopefuls as anti-woman.” BAIER TRACKS: ‘GETTING TO YES’ ON IRAN NUKES… “As more and more details are starting to leak out about a possible U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, an increasing number of U.S. allies appear to be getting very nervous. Israelis, for obvious reasons, are the most concerned. So much so that the conventional wisdom that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would see serious political backlash for speaking to the U.S. Congress about Iran without a White House blessing is being turned around completely. Some Israeli pundits and commentators even called for Netanyahu’s opponent in the upcoming election, Isaac Herzog, to stand alongside the prime minster when he addresses Congress. Herzog declined, but the conversation itself is a sign of the shifting Israeli politics on the issue. The structure of the deal is being dramatically reframed by the Obama administration. As Bloomberg reports, gone is the idea of a grand bargain that would empower moderates and lead to lasting change in Iran’s leadership. This now appears to be just a temporary arms deal that could leave Iran at the brink of having nuclear weapon. That prospect looks different, though, after reading this piece from the Weekly Standard that lays out details of the funding of Al Qaeda operations. It is no wonder that Israel and Gulf State nations are worried. In a remarkable switch, these allies seem to be hoping for the ayatollah in Tehran to have a change of heart and turn the deal down. Because at this point, it seems the Obama administration is trying extremely hard to – in the president’s words – ‘get to yes.’” - Bret Baier. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... The Atlantic examines the phenomenon of how the body registers effects of capsaicin, the active chemical in chilies that causes the burning sensation through a pain receptor, TRPV1. Receptors are found throughout the body, researcher John Hayes, said, and “This is why when you chop chilies, and then rub your eyes, or use the bathroom, without washing your hands, you are in for a world of hurt.” Though it feels like a burn, there isn’t an actual burn occurring, but rather a chemical evolution, “The chili pepper evolved a chemical that fits into that molecular receptor [TRPV1] and lowers the activation energy from 43 [degrees] Celsius to about 34 [degrees] Celsius,” he said. Hayes and fellow researcher Nadia Byrnes, both agree that it is possible to increase tolerance through repeated exposures, particularly at young ages. “Basically, if you don’t like something, the more you eat of it, the more you’ll like it,” Byrnes said.

Scott Walker on Monday said news reporters had created ‘gotcha moments’ that are of little concern to most people and that he would seek to build a campaign that addresses issues important to ‘everyday Americans.’ ‘You’ve seen in the media a lot of talk over the last few days about these self-made, gotcha moments from the media,’ the Wisconsin Republican governor told a convention of religious broadcasters. ‘And they want to talk about things that I don’t think most Americans want to talk about. Our commitment is going forward, we’re going to talk about the things that matter to everyday Americans, and we’ll leave the nonsense to the media aside.’” Means money - The Hill: “Walker’s campaign sent an email requesting donations Sunday night. The email from Friends of Scott Walker, which runs his reelection campaign, said the governor ""refuses to be distracted by the small, petty, and pale ideas that the ‘gotcha’ headline writers for the Liberal Media want to talk about.” EARLY TEXAS PRIMARY SHAKING UP GOP RACE AP: “Texas doesn’t open the voting in presidential campaigns like Iowa and New Hampshire do, but the 2016 Republican race already feels well underway in America's largest conservative state. Much earlier than usual, potential candidates, operatives and donors are maneuvering for advantage here. The urgency comes from Texas' moving its election from the end of the primary calendar toward the beginning. Which, for Republicans, changes everything. Already, would-be presidential hopeful and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has recruited the state's Republican Party chairman to handle communication strategies. “Former Gov. Rick Perry is enlisting powerful Texas donors to prove he’s serious about 2016, notwithstanding his flame-out three years ago. New Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush is stepping forward as a more prominent conservative voice as his father Jeb readies a run, and Sen. Ted Cruz is building a broader fundraising apparatus. Texas’ plan to hold its 2016 primary on March 1 means that only the traditional two early voting states, along with South Carolina and Nevada, would predate it, though some other states may eventually move their primaries up too. In 2012, Texas' primary came in late May, when the GOP race was already settled.” Howdy, hipsters - 2016 contender Sen. Rand Paul is slated to appear at the Austin’s South by Southwest music festival in mid-March. SXSW Interactive: “Paul joins Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith for a special interview at SXSW. The conversation will cover how technology has transformed politics, campaigning, governing and citizen engagement and the future of tech policy.” Perry staying on the trail - Former Gov. Rick Perry [R-Texas] gives a speech tonight at the 2015 RPV Commonwealth Dinner in Richmond, Va. GOP MONEY MEN DIGGING RUBIO NYT:“And though [Sen. Marco Rubio] is not expected to make any official announcement until April, he is quietly telling donors that he is committed to running for president, not re-election to the Senate. (During a stop in Las Vegas, Mr. Rubio met privately with Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and major Republican donor. Neither Mr. Rubio nor Mr. Adelson’s team would comment on what the two men had discussed.) At a seminar last month hosted by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H.

Chris Christie will unveil what he says is a deal with the state teachers union to plug a $1.57 billion budget hole and address the state’s long-term budget woes. In a preview of the speech provided to Fox News First by Christie’s team, the 2016 hopeful will announce that the state’s independent Pension and Health Benefit Study Commission has reached a deal with the New Jersey Education Association to find “a sustainable, long-term solution to the pension problem.” This is significant for Christie since the union bitterly opposed his 2011 budget package. In an excerpt provided by Team Christie, the governor uses the deal to highlight his work as a bipartisan dealmaker: “We do it differently. We get it done. I am committed to working with each and every one of you in good faith to make a promise to the people of this state that we will not push this off…we will not leave it for another day…for another year…for another generation.” [Tune in - You can watch the Christie address live at 2 pm ET. The action-movie-style teaser video is here.] Kasich seeks to convince conservatives on tax plan - Gov. John Kasich has a chance to appeal directly to Ohio voters as he delivers his State of the State address tonight. In a bid to get past opposition among conservative Republicans who seek to block his tax package, Kasich is taking the unusual step of taking his show on the road. As the Cleveland Palin Dealer reports, Kasich is heading to Wilmington in the solidly Republican southwestern part of the state for the speech to make his case for the plan which shifts income taxes to other targets, including sales taxes and energy producers. READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX “Governor Rick Perry has had one of the most successful governorships in our nation's history.

Reuters reports that early today, about 20 manatees, aka sea cows, were rescued from a storm drain in Cape Canaveral, Fla. These creatures habitually flee the colder ocean waters in winter, and head inland to warmer canals, but this group must have taken a wrong turn. This is a rare mishap for the highly intelligent animal. Seems the frigid temperatures have made even the smartest creatures delirious. Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

It’s a very delicate balancing act.""","1077","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/27/baltimore-mayor-balancing-act-gave-protestors-permission-to-turn-violent.html"

"It all started on Saturday night when protests turned to violent riots in the area of the tourist heavy Inner Harbor area. Matt Boyle, a reporter for Breitbart News ended up being in the perimeter of the melee while going to attend a ballgame between the Boston Red Sox and the hometown Orioles. Boyle's live tweets of his observations of the mayhem described a dangerous, out-of-control situation that made him fear for his safety.","1080","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/27/baltimore-mayor-balancing-act-gave-protestors-permission-to-turn-violent.html"
"Boyle's later report described police standing passively by while a family trying to drive through the streets by Camden Yards found their car surrounded, windows smashed, passenger door pried open with the female passenger screaming in terror as the police observed.

"The thin veneer of safety that is required for outsiders to venture into a place as a tourist was shredded by Mayor Rawlings-Blake's pronouncement that her citizens lives and property were not worth protecting from a violent mob.

"What's perhaps even worse is that the mayor's ""giving space to those who wished to destroy"" legitimized the actions of the rioters and encouraged an escalation effectively telling rioter and police officer alike that the city does not have either law enforcement's or the law-abiding citizen's backs as the confrontation continues to grow.","1085","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/27/baltimore-mayor-balancing-act-gave-protestors-permission-to-turn-violent.html"

"For all the sound and fury, it was almost an afterthought when John Boehner’s House passed a funding bill for the Homeland Security Department on Tuesday, with Democrats carrying the ball and Republicans supplying just 75 votes. This, of course, was a complete capitulation from earlier threats to shut down the department rather than acquiesce in President Obama’s unilateral order on immigration.","1096","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/05/gops-homeland-security-fiasco-why-it-wont-matter-in-2016.html"
"And it came after that embarrassing Friday night cliffhanger when a revolt by the hard-line wing defeated Boehner’s bill for a three-week funding extension, and all the House speaker could muster was a one-week stopgap to avoid having the party blamed for a partial shutdown. The Senate, with Mitch McConnell’s help, had already passed a so-called “clean” bill.","1097","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/05/gops-homeland-security-fiasco-why-it-wont-matter-in-2016.html"

"Politico says GOP lawmakers are “shaken” by the debacle and that “the pessimism is palpable,” with many questioning “whether their newfound majority can deliver anything significant over the next two years. The fear among House Republicans is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will be too quick to heed Democratic demands and push through watered-down bills on education, trade, health care and the budget. And the worry among Senate Republicans is that their House counterparts will scuttle hard-fought compromises that offer the only way to overcome filibusters and get bills to President Barack Obama’s desk.""","1099","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/05/gops-homeland-security-fiasco-why-it-wont-matter-in-2016.html"
"Here are a couple of sample quotes. John McCain says he hopes Republicans “will all learn that we are not really fulfilling the commitment we made to voters last November. I campaigned for all these Senate candidates, and I said, ‘Look, we are going to govern.’” Nevada Rep. Mark Amodei says “those people who ran around telling Americans that if both houses are in one party that things are going to start happening, with all due respect, probably oversold it.

"Buzz Cut: • GOP 2016 Power Index: Carson cracks the top five • Walker hits Jeb hard in new spot • Huge Hillary email dump due today • Hillary Iowa support down by a third • Jenny-mandered","1141","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/31/gop-2016-power-index-carson-cracks-top-five.html"
"GOP 2016 POWER INDEX: CARSON CRACKS THE TOP FIVE One of the aphorisms of modern presidential politics is that primary candidates first must fail in order to eventually succeed. That’s certainly a common refrain from the campaign war rooms in Miami and Madison these days. The oft-repeated lines about John McCain’s implosion two years ago or Mitt Romney’s myriad struggles in 2011 and 2012 are only right in hindsight. Sometimes setbacks lead to success. Other times, not so much… But if you want a story about comebacks in the GOP 2016 field, it would be hard to improve on that of Dr. Ben Carson. This spring, Carson had mangled his way through enough interviews to squander a groundswell of early support. Down to 8th place in the crowded field, Carson was declared dead. Decisively so. And yet four months later, Carson has climbed into second place in the GOP horserace nationally and with even more clout in Iowa, where a new poll from Monmouth University shows Carson tied frontrunner Donald Trump. That follows a poll from the Des Moines Register that showed Carson catching up to Trump. In the airless room that is the national political discussion, the explanation of Trump’s success is almost always that his indignant anger mirrors the party’s mood. Then how do we explain Carson’s success? He may be fed up, but Carson is the exact opposite of angry. He is kind and good-natured and exudes a calm that seems to be the antithesis of Trump’s Tigger-like bouncing. The other, even less charitable, explanation for Trump’s success is that white nationalism is rampant in the Republican Party. Carson’s success would seem to, ahem, rather undercut such claims. Perhaps it’s just because Fox News First is in love with words, but there seems to be a better explanation for the summer success of Trump, Carson and fellow outsider Carly Fiorina: Politicians have so thoroughly defeated the language of American English that anyone who sounds like a person sounds wonderful to the ears of a voter. The replacement of plain language with the soul-crushing, Orwellian paragraphs of political boilerplate has been one of the worst consequences of the video era. Everywhere, all the time politicians cover their real meanings with doublespeak. Everyone from your mayor to your president (goodness yes) knows to cover you with jargon, clichés and general drivel. It’s always been a problem, but in the era of social media and campaign trackers, it has become a noxious gas that has settled in every valley and swale of this once straight-talking nation. Carson does not talk like a politician. And that’s why voters are listening. Will it last? Can he sustain his rise in the face of additional scrutiny that his success will bring? That’s a question for after Labor Day. For now, just enjoy the music of plain English. 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Ted Cruz; 3) Donald Trump [+1]; 4) Scott Walker [-1]; 5) Ben Carson [+2]; 6)Carly Fiorina [-1]; 7) Marco Rubio [-1]; 8) John Kasich; 9) Chris Christie [+1]; 10) Rand Paul On the radar: Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Jim Gilmore What would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index we will share the best and brightest with the whole class.

Scott Walker, R-Wisc., compares Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to Democrats on the Iran nuclear deal, name-checking him, and making a direct comparison to Democrats. The ad has a clip of Bush hitting Walker – albeit not by name – for the Wisconsin governor’s promise to tear up the he’d “look at [the deal]” and not just “tear [it] up” on his first day as president. “We have people right there as air controllers who could literally draw in air strikes with absolute precision. They can’t do that. That’s particularly difficult because I talked to a general early this year who said air strikes can be effective, but right now, they’re like a drizzle. He said, ‘We need to have a thunderstorm there’” – Scott Walker in an interview with NBC News. Trump’s tax hikes have general election appeal - Byron York says: “First Donald Trump antagonized the Republican establishment with his proposals on immigration. Then he irritated some with his stands on trade and Social Security. Now Trump is preparing a tax proposal that will again set him far apart from the party’s powers-that-be. The problem for the establishment is that Trump’s positions on all three issues are more in line with the majority of American voters than the establishment’s preferred policies.” Cruz says he’ll be ‘all in’ in N.H. going forward - NHPR: “[Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas] has campaigned more heavily in more socially conservative states such as Iowa and South Carolina; this was his first New Hampshire visit since late May. Cruz says going forward his campaign will be “all in” when it comes to New Hampshire.” [The Boston Herald looks at which campaigns are spending the most on New Hampshire airtime.]","1142","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/31/gop-2016-power-index-carson-cracks-top-five.html"

"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… President Obama will today in Alaska will formally rename America’s tallest mountain, Mt. McKinley, as Denali, the Athabaskan name for the 20,237-foot peak in Alaska’s national park of the same name. Democrats have long despised McKinley – a booster of big business and American imperialism – but maybe they were just jealous. McKinley was the first president to be filmed in office, thanks to Thomas Edison. He was also the first president to ever ride in an automobile, a steam-powered car, built by brothers Francis and Freelan Stanley. Their company, Stanley Motor Carriage Company, produced a number of steam-engine cars before losing out to the superior internal combustion engine. A less enviable first: McKinley would also ride in an electric ambulance after his assassination in on Sept. 5, 1901. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

WashEx: “State officials have said they plan to release ‘6,106 or more pages’ of emails Monday, according to court documents filed in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Vice News that has forced the agency to publish Clinton’s emails on a rolling basis.” The document dump comes just days after Clinton’s effort to dispel clouds of doubt among the party elite over her server scandal at the DNC’s summer meeting and follows a week which saw the number of emails that contained classified information shared among the former secretary of state and her close confidents rise to 63. That number is expected to grow. Clinton surrogates are arguing that since she did not know what she was mishandling was classified, she is not likely guilty of some of the more serious criminal charges that have been discussed. [Politico delivers a who’s who of those drawn into the email quagmire.] Well, he can kiss the perv vote goodbye - “Huma Abedin, the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener, was a major security risk as a collector of info” – Tweet from Donald Trump. Hillary Iowa support down by a third - Des Moines Register: “…Clinton has lost a third of her supporters since May, a trajectory that if sustained puts her at risk of losing again in Iowa, the initial crucible in the presidential nominating contest. This is the first time Clinton, the former secretary of state and longtime presumptive front-runner, has dropped below the 50 percent mark in four polls conducted by the Register and Bloomberg Politics this year. Poll results include Vice President Joe Biden as a choice, although he has not yet decided whether to join the race. Biden captures 14 percent, five months from the first-in-the-nation vote Feb. 1. Even without Biden in the mix, Clinton falls below a majority, at 43 percent.” Pressure piling up on Schultz for shielding Hillary from debates - NPR: “Making a parallel argument to the one conservatives make on the Republican side, [Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.] blamed the party, in part, for major losses in the 2014 midterm elections, because liberal base voters didn’t have something to vote for.… Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley also took aim at the party’s establishment, repeating his criticism of the Democratic debate schedule, which begins in October. He described it as a ‘rigged process’ and ‘a cynical move to delay and limit our own party debates.’ O’Malley, who trails in the polls, wants more debates. ‘Four debates, and four debates only, we are told — not asked — before voters in our earliest states make their decision,’ O’Malley said, making for a rather awkward moment with DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz as he left the stage.” Clinton campaign touts re-re-endorsement from Shaheen - Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., has been a Hillary Clinton supporter nearly as long as anyone, and made her support for the current Clinton candidacy official two years ago. But looking to shore up a crumbling New Hampshire lead, Clinton is recycling Shaheen’s support for a campaign event there on Saturday. 2016 Democratic Power Index: Mo’Joe - 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Joe Biden; 3) Bernie Sanders; 4) Martin O’Malley; 5) Jim Webb; 6) Elizabeth Warren; 7) Lincoln Chaffee; 8) Al Gore JENNY-MANDERED Quartz: “They say that every vote counts, but it’s not usually this literal: A vote on a local sales-tax increase in Columbia, Missouri will be decided this month by Jen Henderson, a 23-year-old college student. Henderson is the only person eligible to vote on the increase because she is the only legal resident of the Business Loop 70 Community Improvement District (CID), the Columbia Tribune reports. That’s where the City Council is trying to push through a sales tax increase at the behest of the district’s business owners. Under state law, the increase must be approved by residents of the district…Henderson is leaning against voting for the tax increase, the Tribune reported, after the CID’s director approached her to consider unregistering her vote, which she said was ‘pretty manipulative.’” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"But to focus on only the diversity of the field misses a much more important point about the Republican candidates. More than anything the five now declared candidates represent how deeply divided and dispirited the Republican Party is.","1232","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/04/carson-fiorina-join-gop-race-yes-2016-offers-more-diversity-but-also-more.html"
"To my mind, this is the more interesting story to come from the early weeks of campaigning. The range of candidates clearly demonstrates that the GOP has failed, yet again, to find a consensus message or approach to presidential politics. This isn’t to say that it’s not useful to hear from a range of voices with differing opinions, but in a world where the Republicans are still polling behind the Democrats and quite obviously lacking in cohesion, it is all the more clear that these new names will not do any good in terms of re-building and strengthening the Republican brand.","1233","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/04/carson-fiorina-join-gop-race-yes-2016-offers-more-diversity-but-also-more.html"

"Protest candidates on the Republican side have done well in the past. Herman Cain saw some success in 2008. And Ben Carson’s success at CPAC and in early polls shows that there’s an appetite to hear from a political outsider. To this end, expect to see a bump in the polls just like we saw for other candidates after they formally threw their hat in the ring.","1235","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/04/carson-fiorina-join-gop-race-yes-2016-offers-more-diversity-but-also-more.html"
"The desire for a fresh face with an anti-establishment attitude in American politics is well documented. Polls have shown that over three quarters of Americans want to hear from new people with innovative ideas. Because of this, Carson may very well see some success and Fiorina will surely have an appeal to some.","1236","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/04/carson-fiorina-join-gop-race-yes-2016-offers-more-diversity-but-also-more.html"
"But both of these candidates are not really running for president. Carson is almost certainly running for HHS secretary or surgeon general. And Fiorina is running for Vice President, which I don’t see her getting, or a senior job in the government based on a singular focus on attacking Hillary Clinton.","1237","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/04/carson-fiorina-join-gop-race-yes-2016-offers-more-diversity-but-also-more.html"
"All this is not to say that the Republicans can’t win come 2016. They most certainly can. The general election will be a very tight race with Hillary Clinton and the major contenders within just a few points of each other in recent polling. Further, with the Obama administration still below 50% in approval ratings and likely to fail on trade bill and potentially on the Iranian nuclear deal, there will be plenty of opportunities for the Republicans to seize upon Democrat failures.","1238","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/04/carson-fiorina-join-gop-race-yes-2016-offers-more-diversity-but-also-more.html"
"But the Republicans have had opportunities like this before and squandered them. It’s up to them to come together with a unified message that champions a pro-growth economic agenda, smart reform to our broken immigration and health care system and a vision for a strong American abroad.","1239","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/04/carson-fiorina-join-gop-race-yes-2016-offers-more-diversity-but-also-more.html"
"It follows that it would be a mistake to see the entry of people like Carson and Fiorina as anything but a symptom, yes, of a more diverse field, but more so of a divided Republican party.

"“After hearing what he heard, seeing what he saw, [Carson] believes that the American people will stand behind what he said,” Watts told FoxNews.com. “We have a security crisis on the border.

"The advice from top political strategists is for Walker and Bush, who will likely be on either side of Trump and within the frame of most camera angles of Trump, to keep the smirks off their faces. Their best strategy is to force him to answer questions about foreign affairs, health care and terrorism that reveal the limits of his policy knowledge, and then let viewers judge his readiness for the White House.","1341","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"The morning-after test for Trump will be his entertainment value and his ability to answer serious questions about policy. A caustic comment or two will light up the Twitter universe and satisfy the bloodlust among viewers tuning in for a fight. But the reigning champion of the early Republican primary contest has to show he can get serious on issues of critical concern if he wants to keep his crown at the end of the night.","1344","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"Walker is the Republican most directly threatened by Trump’s rise. He has worked very hard to position himself as the leading conservative alternative to the establishment candidates like Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio.","1346","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"
"Walker’s plainspoken delivery is appealing, but he has yet to show a grasp of national or international issues, and he has flip-flopped on big issues like immigration, ethanol subsidies and Common Core education standards. In the high-pressure, sound-bite-driven forum of a debate, he risks coming across as callow and uninformed. Can he avoid looking like he is in over his head?","1347","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"Because he got into the race so early, Bush was able to lock up most of the big money donations and establishment support. This has given him a firewall to withstand the Trump surge. Donors and party stalwarts loyal to his father and brother have stuck with him this far, but a poor debate performance will unlock the gates of political anxiety, and that might start a rush of people with deep pockets to other candidates.","1349","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"
"Bush has not backed down on his support for Common Core and comprehensive immigration reform. This consistency will help him if he makes it to the general election, but it puts two big targets on his back in this debate. Trump and the other candidates are going to come at him hard from the right on both issues. Bush needs to make it clear that he is not a flip-flopper, that he is seriously committed to his positions and that he cares more about people than about playing expedient political games for short-term benefits.","1350","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"Keep your eye on Dr. Carson. He could well be the breakthrough star of Thursday night’s debate. His humble, calm and thoughtful demeanor is a powerful contrast to the bluster and hot rhetoric of Trump. Carson needs to make the case to the GOP base that his quiet, reserved form of conservatism is better for the health of the party than Trump. And with Carly Fiorina, the former corporate manager, not likely to qualify for the primetime debate, he will stand out on the all-male stage as the only person who is not white.","1352","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"In the last few weeks the polls have not been kind to Sen. Rubio. The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll over the weekend gave him 5 percent. A Monmouth University Pol released Monday has him at 4.4 percent. Those numbers constitute a big drop from May when he was at 14 percent support in the Real Clear Politics report which averages the results of major polls. But the Florida senator is still popular among Republicans who give him a high favorable rating and he still remains near the top when voters select their second choice. So Rubio’s goal on the debate stage is to show off his knowledge on big issues, especially foreign policy, and remind voters why they once had him as their first choice.","1354","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"Wouldn’t it have been great to be a fly on the wall for Cruz’s private meeting with Trump in New York last month? The Texas senator is one of the most cynical and calculating politicians. He apparently has no interest in returning to the U.S. Senate after blowing up his relationships there by calling Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a “liar.”","1356","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

He has done well in fundraising and can afford to wait until that happens.","1357","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"As for the candidates who do not qualify for the primetime debate, they will be on television for a one-hour debate at 5 p.m. on Thursday. Polls show most voters don’t know Fiorina, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Their goal is to say hello to the voters and make a positive impression. A shot at Trump from Perry or Graham, who have a record of butting heads with the billionaire front-runner, will generate headlines. But their energy is better invested in delivering a message that sets them apart on any issue as serious and passionate and deserving of a second look before their campaigns fade to black.","1361","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/trump-cruz-carson-and-more-your-guide-to-scoring-republican-debate.html"

"HILLARY’S BEST CASE SCENARIO GETS WORSE It looks increasingly like the best-case scenario for Hillary Clinton might be that someone from her inner circle will face serious consequences for their handling of classified information on her secret, home email server. This is “best case” because, as has been pointed out, the charges from an inspector general will be extremely hard to duck. So a good outcome at this point for Clinton on the allegations of mishandling sensitive documents as America’s chief diplomat might really be the ability to blame “staff error” for the breach. Yes, it will always be Clinton who took the risk of having a home brew server in her basement, but the blame for specific lapses could be pinned to others. Thanks to a sacrificial staffer, Clinton would still be able to say that she had not been prosecuted. But with the FBI snatching servers from contractors and Democrats getting jittery, running out the clock with a strategic retreat and staff scapegoat is not the recipe for restoring optimism in her campaign. There are practical considerations to having senior staffers’ necks on the block, as well. With news that Clinton’s right hand, Huma Abedin, is under scrutiny, things might not be so hip in Brooklyn these days. A campaign that struggles always with insularity and aloofness can’t improve with G-men running around and the “do not delete” orders hanging thick in the air. The Clinton campaign has a good way to deal with the steady barrage from House Republican investigators: call it a partisan witch hunt and dismiss any findings. But that won’t wash with the Obama Justice Department. Admitting staff incompetence would hardly be the end of the world for a presidential candidate, but Clinton is a different case. The recklessness of Clinton’s choice to use her secret email is an issue and so is her overall judgment. If Clinton wants to argue that she’s the experienced, steady hand for the job, this badly undercuts her claim. It’s no wonder that Democratic top dogs are reportedly becoming more receptive to the idea of a Joe Biden candidacy. It may be a needful thing. [But so Glamorous - Glamour magazine gushed over Abedin and other Clinton staffers in a lengthy photo essay. In a nod to bipartisanship, though, the famously liberal fashion mag found room for AshLee Strong and Kirsten Kukowski from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s inner circle.] Told you so - Speaker John Boehner and Benghazi Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., released a web video highlighting their months-long appeal for Hillary Clinton to turn over her emails and server. Video ends with the simply phrase “It’s about time.” PROTECTION IS THEIR MIDDLE NAME Times had been good for President Obama’s EPA. Just last week, the regulatory agency the president has leaned on to lock-in his global warming legacy pushed out a major new rule to drastically cut carbon emissions from power plants, a move heartily endorsed by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. But 48 hours after that rule was announced, an EPA contractor botched the clean-up of a Colorado mine dumping 3 million gallons of mustard-colored contaminated waste into the Animas River. EPA’s lackluster initial response, often poorly communicated and incomplete, has drawn heavy criticism from state, local and downstream states’ officials. And the incident has lawmakers questioning whether the agency that has steamrolled over the coal industry with its regulatory edicts is too focused on fulfilling the president’s future agenda at cost of its primary purpose. “This disaster emphasizes the need for the EPA to focus on fulfilling its existing responsibilities, instead of focusing its resources on imposing expensive new regulations that kill jobs and hurt family budgets.” – Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. [For the people - Looks like the donors to Obama’s presidential library may have some Romneysian tax tendencies…] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Fans of scary movies will be surprised to know that the king of their genre was actually a classic comedian. Alfred Hitchcock, born on this day in 1899 and set the gold standard of scary movies, was actually known for a dry, sharp, sense of humor. Hitchcock’s reputation as a “solemn-faced” Englishman, was matched with “making outrageous puns and ghoulish observations about the tales he told,” according to TIME reporter Richard Schickel in a 1980 piece. For example, Hitchcock responded to criticism of a comment he made about actors, “It has been said that I called actors cattle. I would never say such a rude, insulting thing. What I probably said was that all actors should be treated like cattle.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Walker’s once steady lead is no more, but how did he lose it?

Jeb Bush’s, R-Fla.] campaign announced the new round of supporters Wednesday night. Among them: GOP elected officials, party leaders and activists from Woodbury County on the state’s western border to Scott County on its eastern edge, and from its most populous counties in central Iowa.” [Bush is in Iowa today for a National Security forum in Davenport, and the Polk County Summer Sizzle.] Carson gets real on race in Harlem - NYDN: “Republican presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson had some tough words for the Democrats — and for his fellow African-Americans — during a campaign swing through New York Wednesday. ‘Of course black lives matter,’ said Carson…‘What I feel, instead of people pointing fingers at each other, and just creating strife, what we need to be talking about is, how do we solve the problem in the black community of murder,’ Carson said.” Rand, Trump drama continues - Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., released a web video highlighting Donald Trump’s liberal past, and making the case that Trump is just like the Clintons with President Bill Clinton’s famous question asking the meaning of the word “is.” Trump wasted no time in responding to the video releasing a lengthy response to WaPo saying in part, “Rand Paul is doing so poorly in the polls he has to revert to old footage of me discussing positions I no longer hold.” Catching on to Carly - The NYT catches on to candidate Carly Fiorina’s longstanding pitch: that she would neuter Democratic attacks about a Republican war on women. “In a crowded Republican field, [Carly Fiorina] has delivered the most forceful and succinct denunciation of Mr. Trump’s comments, which sent a shudder through a party concerned that it would reinforce perceptions that it was increasingly out of touch with female voters. Now, many Republicans…are looking anew at Mrs. Fiorina…as the party’s weapon to counter the perception that it is waging a ‘war on women.’” [Fiorina participates in a Town Hall hosted by Iowa agribusiness mogul, Bruce Rastetter.] Cruz will attend Koch network event in Vegas - Sen.

Chris Christie, R-N.J., and Rand Paul, over NSA spying and Fourth Amendment protections. “The whole purpose of the probable cause standard is to force the government to focus on people it suspects of wrongdoing and leave the rest of us alone,” the judge rules, “Christie wants the feds to use a fish net.

WEIGHT A SECOND ITV News: “An airline is weighing passengers at check-in before allowing them to board to ensure ‘flight safety.’ Uzbekistan Airways announced on its website that passengers will be weighed with their hand luggage on special machines at the departure gate. The company promised customers confidentiality but the move could mean that heavier passengers are excluded from smaller planes or busy flights. In a message to passengers, the airline said: ‘…After passing check-in on flight and prior to boarding into the aircraft, we will suggest you to pass the procedure of weighing with the special weighing machine placed in the departure gate zone…’ The airline is seemingly following the example set by Samoan Air, which became the world's first airline to charge passengers according to their weight in 2013.

"RUBIO LOOKS TO CASH IN AT CAMP MITT Who’s up for a Cherry Coke Zero and a little flag football? If that’s your bag, then Mitt Romney’s annual gathering of politicians, policy wonks and rich people at a Utah resort is the place to be this weekend. This is the Romneysian answer to the February cattle calls for conservatives held by groups like Charles and David Koch and their donor network. Instead of golf, cigars and an emphasis on political strategy, the Romney meeting is about squeaky-clean outdoor fun and policy. But make no mistake, this is a major-league tryout with high stakes. The one who stand to benefit most is Marco Rubio, who has seen his poll numbers retreat since his April launch but has had continuing success in making his case to establishment donors wary of Jeb Bush’s general election viability. Those are just the kind of people who will be in the mountains with Romney. When Romney opted against a 2016 run in January, he called for “the next generation of Republican leaders” to take the reins. That fits precisely with Rubio’s generational appeal to his party as a GOP JFK. Rubio has also been putting in plenty of sweat equity to win Romney’s blessing. Rubio’s political skills plus Romney’s donor network could be just the recipe to defeat Jeb Bush. Plenty of Romney team members have ended up in Rubio’s orbit and he has the strongest case to make as a fusion candidate who can unite the donor class with the activist core. Less likely to get Romney to pop open another pack of Peanut M&Ms is Scott Walker. Walker, more of a blunt instrument, is farther right than most of the residents of Romneyland. Plus, Walker’s book bags on Romney’s 2012 campaign. At length. But Walker’s task is no less important than Rubio’s. At a meeting of technocrats and moderate Republicans, Walker can’t afford to be seen as unready or dangerous. Just as Rubio has to stay an acceptable second choice to Walker among Iowa voters, Walker has to be broadly acceptable to the elites. Rubio is riding behind Walker when it comes to Iowa Harley tours and hog roasts, but this weekend it’s Rubio who has the home-field advantage. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are all reportedly going to be on hand and will get the chance to make their cases to the CEO set. But for them, the idea is more about getting the whale donors to hold off in backing Rubio long enough to get their own national campaigns in position. [Watch Fox: Megyn Kelly interviews Romney ahead of the kickoff of his summit tonight on “The Kelly File” at 9 p.m. ET. Megyn, who joins other bold-face media figures at the gathering, will moderate the main event: Romney’s keynote session on Friday afternoon.] Haven’t you always wondered what they look like in Tevas? - Also on the bipartisan guest list: Yahoo News’ Katie Couric, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, GE CEO Jeff Immelt, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, and Obama soothsayer David Axelrod. Who’s not there: Bush wraps up his overseas trip this weekend ahead of his Monday announcement in Miami. He and Romney had a “gentlemanly” meeting earlier this year prior to Romney’s decision to not mount a third presidential run. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will be in Oklahoma Saturday for a state party luncheon. No surprise here. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. is in California Friday and Saturday to raise money in Newport Beach and Irvine. Paul backed Romney in 2012 over Paul’s own father, but the Kentucky senator said a few months ago that Romney should “never” run again. Ben Carson will not attend the Romney forum either, but his campaign didn’t have a weekend plan yet, telling Fox News it would release his public schedule later today. JEB CALLS FOR ‘SHOW OF ROBUST FORCE’ AGAINST PUTIN AP: “The United States should consider sending thousands more U.S. troops, along with NATO forces, to Eastern Europe to match the strength Russian President Vladimir Putin is amassing in the region, Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush said Wednesday. Capping the two-day German leg of a European trip aimed at bolstering the former Florida governor's foreign policy credentials, Bush said Putin is ‘a bully’ who can only be contained by a show of robust force.” Koch-backed group calls foul on Walker’s arena plan - Legislation to provide public funding for a new pro basketball arena in Milwaukee is gaining criticism from opponents on the left, predictably, but concerns from the right may make Walker pause. Wisconsin’s state director of Americans for Prosperity, David Fladeboe, said in a statement, “Government shouldn’t be in the business of financing private sports stadiums.” The group is backed by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch who have publicly stated their affinity for Walker. And with a recent pledge to spend more in this cycle, this stadium may be more hassle than it’s worth. Perry PAC hits Iowa airwaves - The super PAC backing former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, highlights his bootstraps beginnings and rise through the military in a new ad. Carly’s PAC shacks Hillary - Carly Fiorina’s super PAC has a new ad out aimed at her favorite target: Hillary. Fiorina is in Washington where she’ll deliver a speech on State of Women in America at the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Annual Dinner. [Watch Fox: Fiorina faces questions from the All-Star Panel in the Center Seat tonight on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”] Kasich staffing move draws ire in S.C. - Kasich’s decision to hire strategists John Weaver and Fred Davis, notorious GOP Party crashers, was met with groans among many party activists. But as David Drucker reports, nowhere was the move met with more hostility than in South Carolina where the two worked to oust incumbent Gov. Nikki Haley. [Kasich has a meet and greet with Clark County Republicans in Las Vegas.] Graham introduces 20-week abortion bill today - Lindsey Graham introduces the Pain Capable Child Protection Act in the Senate today, which stipulates that abortions must be performed in the first 20 weeks of the pregnancy. Graham’s timing couldn’t be worse for senators in competitive senate seats this cycle whose vote on a highly controversial issue could give fodder to Democratic contenders. CAMPAIGN DAYBOOK Rand Paul is in Washington today speaking to young Republicans. Chris Christie has events in Iowa including a midday speech on education at Iowa State University in Ames. Ben Carson continues his two day Iowa swing with a breakfast event in Fort Dodge. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Tiny Moog Music of Asheville, N.C. made national headlines this week with news that the company’s owner was giving 49 percent of the firm to its 62 employees. As a business story, it’s a man-bites-dog classic suitable for the clickbait era – “You won’t believe what this CEO did…” But for music lovers, Moog and its eponymous product remains a big deal. The first truly electronic instrument, the Moog synthesizer used transistors to replicate the otherworldly sounds. The big breakthrough came with classical music for performances which relied on the Moog’s Theremin-like sound. Soon, popular performers got in on the act with tracks like The Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun” and Stevie Wonder’s “I Believe (When I Fall in Love).” But it wasn’t until the rise of prog rock in the 1970s that the Moog found its fullest flower. Groups like Yes and Emerson Lake & Palmer loved the Moog. (You can see it in action on Electric Light Orchestra’s video for “Can’t Get it Out of My Head.”) Moog was driven into bankruptcy by the rise of cheap, portable synthesizers, but was saved in recent years as younger audiences rediscovered its richer, unique sound.

Hence word that Hillary Clinton and rivals Martin O’Malley, Bernie Sanders and Jim Webb will share the stage at the 2015 Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame Celebration July 17 in Cedar Rapids. In contrast to numerous Republican multi-candidate events in the state, the Cedar Rapids gathering will be the first where the Democratic contenders will appear together, according to Iowa Democratic Party spokesman Sam Lau. [On his second trip to Iowa since announcing his candidacy, Martin O’Malley has a trio of events in the Hawkeye State today. Bernie Sanders begins a two day tour on Friday. Jim Webb heads to Iowa next week] Clintons clash over Bubba’s email - Fox News: “[A]t a Clinton Global Initiative meeting in Denver…[Bill Clinton] said the ‘only time’ he got on the Internet was to do ‘two emails’ and order Christmas presents…The statement echoes what a spokesman told the Wall Street Journal in March -- that the ex-president had only sent two emails in his life, one to U.S. troops and the other to astronaut John Glenn. Yet, when Hillary Clinton held a press conference in March explaining her personal email use, she said her private server ‘contains personal communications from my husband and me.’” [But who will pay the bills? - Asked if he’ll continue to rake in six-figure speaking fees if Hillary wins the White House, Bubba told Bloomberg: “No, I don’t think so.”] Not yet - Teasing out an apparent cat-and-mouse game, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio office says he’ll be a no-show at Hillary Clinton’s campaign launch WSJ: “Mr. de Blasio, who managed Mrs. Clinton’s winning 2000 campaign for Senate and supported her 2008 presidential bid, said at an unrelated news conference that “I’ve always liked what I heard from Bernie Sanders,” the independent Vermont senator who is running for the Democratic 2016 nomination.” [Sanders participates in Christian Science Monitor breakfast and media availability today in Washington.] THE JUDGE’S RULING: BAIT AND SWITCH Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says replacing the expired section authorizing the NSA’s bulk collection of phone data under the Patriot Act with the Freedom Act has changed little. In what he calls an “insidious bait and switch,” the judge asks, “What is the value of a constitutional guarantee if the people into whose hands we repose the Constitution for safe keeping can change it as they see fit and negate the guarantee?” Read morehere. COON HUNTING HELPS RYAN MOVE TRADE BILL AP: “Immigration hardliner Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said Wednesday he moved from leaning ‘no’ to a solid ‘yes’ after [Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.,] assured him that trade negotiations would include no changes to immigration policy. ‘It’s actually a significant benefit because it will prohibit the negotiation of immigration provisions of any kind in any trade agreement that’s negotiated under the TPA,’ said King, who spoke for 10 to 15 minutes with Ryan during which time King spotted a raccoon heading out of his barn to prowl. That led to a discussion of raccoon hunting and guns before they reached agreement on the trade bill, King said.” THE REALTOR MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN TO MENTION SHOCKWAVE Springfield [Mo.] News Leader: “Four ambulances, three Greene County Sheriff's deputies, a couple of Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers, a firetruck and a few more emergency vehicles descended on a farm just east of Springfield on Monday afternoon. Authorities had received a report of a possible plane crash in the area…but what the callers — who are new to the neighborhood — thought was a plane crash…ended up being a bath for Shockwave, the jet-powered semi-truck that tops out at 376 miles per hour. Shockwave’s owner, Neal Darnell, said he raced the vehicle — which looks like a fighter plane and a semi-truck had a baby — on a dirt course last week, so the truck needed to be washed on Monday.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is not something that’s going to have any effect and the most shocking fact of all is what you have just enumerated is that we’ve trained exactly zero Sunnis…And our only hope would have been get the Sunnis to join us against.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"It was clear to everyone in a windowless conference room in the basement of Cleveland’s Quicken Loans Arena that this would be the most incendiary question of the debate.","Published August 06, 2015","1475","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"

"Kelly said she would ask Donald Trump: ""You’ve called women you don't like 'fat pigs', 'dogs', 'slobs'"" and ""disgusting animals"", including on Twitter. Did he have the temperament to be president?","1477","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"There was some discussion of whether another woman, Hillary Clinton, should be added to the question. Kelly wanted to keep the Twitter reference so people could go online and see for themselves what Trump had written over the years and that it wasn’t just about Rosie O’Donnell. She felt there was a good chance she would be booed by the audience—and that The Donald would hit back hard.","1478","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"“If Trump comes after me, don’t jump in and save me,” Kelly told her co-moderators.","1479","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"As it turned out, part of the audience tittered, Trump interrupted to say he was talking about Rosie, then said he was not politically correct and had always been nice to Megyn—but maybe he shouldn’t be anymore. He had parried a hard question with a series of thrusts.","1480","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Thursday night’s presidential debate was the product of a seemingly endless series of meetings involving Fox executives and the Baier-Kelly-Wallace team, which also handled the debates in 2011 and 2012. The arduous phrasing and honing of the questions was complicated by the time constraints imposed by having 10 candidates on stage.","1481","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"For all the media chatter about Fox and the Republican Party, these sessions were driven by one goal: how to ask the candidates tough questions and pin them down. I saw the same meticulous process as a reporter at an Orlando debate in 2011, before I joined Fox News. The anchors barreled ahead, knowing full well that their aggressive approach in Cleveland would draw flak from some on the right.","1482","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"The team spent considerable time on the wording of what would be the night’s first question: Would everyone on stage agree to endorse the winner of the Republican primaries? The discussion turned to whether that seemed like a Trump question.","1483","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"“It is a Trump question,” Washington Managing Editor Bill Sammon said.","1484","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Baier would ask for a show of hands. What if Trump was the only one not to take the pledge? Then, the group decided, the “Special Report” anchor would ask a followup about how Trump could seek the GOP nod without ruling out a third-party bid. (Trump took the bait, raised his hand, and the debate made news in its opening moments.)","1485","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Wallace offered up a question for Jeb Bush, tying it to Hillary Clinton’s recent charge that he is part of the war on women. As the “Fox News Sunday” anchor described it, he would ask the former Florida governor about supporting a defunding of Planned Parenthood and his recent foot-in-mouth comment that $500 million might be too much to spend on women’s health.","1486","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Kelly also discussed a question about opposition to abortion for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who did not support making an exception if the mother’s life was at stake. Did that stance render him out of the mainstream?","1487","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"With a number of hot-button issues slated for the top, there was concern in the room that some viewers, or candidates, might find that jarring. “We should forecast it, here we come with our hot stuff,” Baier suggested.","1488","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Baier tried out a question about Marco Rubio’s tax plan and whether it amounted to “trickle-down economics.” Sammon wondered whether the lengthy question could be streamlined.","1489","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Kelly's potential question for Ben Carson centered on his past misstatements, such as not knowing that the Baltic states were part of NATO. Was the surgeon too inexperienced to be president?","1490","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"The thrust of these sessions was about how best to probe the candidates’ weaknesses, get them off their talking points and close off rhetorical escape routes.","1491","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"But there were also mundane considerations, such as what sound would cut off the candidates after 60 seconds—a basketball buzzer was considered and rejected--and how many questions and answers, divided into what the team called “buckets,” could be squeezed in before each set of commercials. One such break would last nearly four minutes and, a staffer explained, give the 10 candidates a chance to go to the bathroom.","1492","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Kelly relished the idea: “Men are finally going to be in the same position as women are with the bathrooms—all going to the same stall.”","1493","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Although the session waded deep into the nitty-gritty, everyone in the room was acutely aware of the stakes.","1494","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Michael Clemente, Fox’s executive vice president for news, told the gathering it was “breathtaking to see how much attention” the debate was drawing. “I think it’s going to be as big as LeBron going back to Cleveland,” he said.","1495","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"By yesterday afternoon, there was more banter and kibitzing to break the tension, especially on what were seen as difficult questions. Kelly said she planned to ask Ohio Gov. John Kasich about expanding Medicaid in his state by saying St. Peter at the pearly gates would ask what he did for the poor: “Why should people think you won’t use the St. Peter rationale to expand every government program?” That prompted a chorus of oooh’s.","1496","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Kelly, who famously asked Jeb Bush the question that tripped him up on the Iraq war, now planned to ask him about the families of those killed in action: “How do you now look at them and say your brother’s war was a mistake?” Another strong reaction.","1497","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Baier was torn between asking Trump one of two questions, either about his past support for single-payer health care and other liberal programs, or about his contributions to Democratic lawmakers. The room was divided as well. (He wound up asking both.)","1498","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"Some of the back-and-forth turned on math. Trump and Bush were each down for seven questions, and Marco Rubio for six after a “hanging chad” recount, but Ted Cruz would have two rebuttals. Were they being careful enough in splitting up the time?","1499","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"“I don’t want to be defending how some guy got shortchanged,” Sammon said.","1500","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"He paused for a moment of reflection, telling the group: “I have one tiny tiny worry, in 1 percent of my brain, that it’ll be anticlimactic,"" that the anchors would have to ""spur it along.”","1501","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"An hour before airtime, Brit Hume, the Fox debate veteran who stopped by the windowless conference room, wondered if the moderators would ask about a Politico story quoting an unnamed donor as saying Bush had called Trump a ""buffoon,"" ""clown"" and ""asshole.""","1502","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"The consensus was to ask Bush if it was true, perhaps drawing a response from The Donald. But how to deal with the language issue?","1503","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"""You say A-hole,"" Hume said.","1504","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"""You can't say A-hole,"" Kelly responded. ""You can't even say blank-hole.""","1505","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"The compromise was ""a word that cannot be repeated on television.""","1506","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"On stage Bush denied the story, but called Trump’s rhetoric “divisive.” Trump, with a nod toward the moderators, said “I don’t think they like me very much.” It was anything but dull.","1507","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"
"""These are really good questions,"" tweeted Jeff Greenfield, the former ABC and CNN correspondent. ""The moderators have done their homework, thought through what they want to zero in on.""","1508","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/behind-fox-debate-how-anchors-prepped-questions.html"

"AS VOTERS COOL, HILLARY TRIES GLOBAL WARMING GAMBIT What would possess Hillary Clinton to propose a massive solar panel funding plan and to call for expanding the Obama administration’s carbon crackdown? Aside from some unhappy baggage from solar-panel stimulus, there’s considerable general election risk in going “bold” on global warming. It’s a niche issue that alienates blue-collar voters, especially in the Midwest. Democrats may tout polls that show a plurality of adults now believe in man-made global warming, it’s a loser with middle-class families in places like Ohio and Michigan. While Clinton has strenuously avoided details in her plan so she can move right next year, ever branding oneself as to the left of Obama on global warming and as the candidate of solar subsidy is not a good move for a Democrat. But given her current electoral woes, Clinton may feel she has no choice. Clinton is not going photovoltaic to fend off Sen. Bernie Sanders, per se, but rather what he represents: deep misgivings about Clinton’s trustworthiness. That Pew found 96 percent of “solid liberals” would do “whatever it takes” to protect the environment tells you the power global warming has in her party – it acts as a social, quasi-religious issue with the Democratic base. And, by Gaia, she needs help fast. The presumptive Democratic nominee needs a quick ending to her primary process as it becomes clear how much trouble she has with the larger electorate. Two recent polls show Clinton almost as unpopular as Donald Trump with swing state-voters, and that was before news broke about the new pressure for a Department of Justice probe into claims she used a private email server for classified messages. It’s the story of her campaign in miniature: Clinton keeps racing to the left in order to placate suspicious base voters and regenerate the Obama coalition of 2012, but primary voters appear unmoved. Meantime, Clinton’s doing so deepens rather than allays concerns with the moderate voters she will need next year. And as she is pushed into what for mainstream voters remains an economic issue, Clinton takes a risk greater than her many other pivots. The best argument Clinton has to make in 2016 is a return to the Bubbalicious boom times of the 1990s. Every new stance she takes that suggests she is going to be Obamanomic in her approach undercuts her candidacy. 2016 Democratic Power Index: 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Bernie Sanders; 3) Joe Biden [+1]; 4) Martin O’Malley [-1]; 5) Jim Webb; 6) Elizabeth Warren; 7) Lincoln Chaffee Fox News First would rank Martin O’Malley even lower given the fact that he managed to get booed by party activists for stating that “all lives matter” but for the fact that the other two declared candidates barely register. [Watch Fox: Shannon Bream brings us the latest on the debate to defund Planned Parenthood and breaks down how much the abortion provider is costing you in an “It’s All Your Money – Taxpayer Calculator” report throughout the day and on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”] Dems’ Planned Parenthood woes here to stay - AP: “Two stealthily recorded videos show Planned Parenthood officials discussing how they provide aborted fetal organs for research. The videos have put the group and its Democratic allies on the defensive. It’s unclear how long the political damage may last or whether Planned Parenthood has broken federal law — as abortion foes contend. What is clear is that Republicans and anti-abortion groups are giving no signs of letting the issue fade quickly.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… They say “no Marine left behind,” and here’s proof they mean it. The remains of 36 Marines killed in the hellish fighting on the island of Tarawa in 1943 have come home. The repatriation and eventual identification of the war dead comes after many years of searching by government and private investigators, but it is only a start. More than 500 servicemen, mostly Marines, remain unaccounted for from the battle. Though the casualties of the battle were less than many major Pacific engagements, the savagery of the resistance of the doomed Japanese garrison – well documented in a book by war correspondent Robert Lee Sherrod and, most famously by a 20-minute documentary made from battlefield footage – changed American thinking about the enormity of the task in defeating the empire. Believed to be among the remains discovered are those of 1st Lt. Sandy Bonnyman, whose story you really ought to know. Welcome home. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Send your thoughts toFOXNEWSFIRST@FOXNEWS.COM JEB RAIDS DEM DONORS IN HILLARYLAND While the posh Hamptons turf on N.Y.’s Long Island may be considered Hillaryland, Jeb doesn’t seem to a problem mining in her backyard, Bloomberg reports:“The former Florida governor held fundraisers in the well-to-do New York beach communities over the weekend. While the [Jeb Bush] is no stranger to courting wealthy donors, this time was different: about half the attendees were Democrats. ‘This guy sells well,’ said Kenneth Lipper, the money manager and registered Democrat who hosted [one] event, after Bush left. Virtually the only one who left without writing a check, Lipper said, was a buck deer that wandered past the group assembled on the wooded grounds.” [Bush hosts central Florida pastors for a meet and greet today in Orlando, then tours a local small business and holds a town hall in Longwood. Later in the day Bush will host a meet and greet in Maitland.] Walker lays out his ‘100 days’ plan - Scott Walker discusses his plan to downsize Washington with WashEx: “My belief, my push, my thought is about pushing money from Washington back to the states and even, in some cases, back to local governments… Having a federal government that, instead of being too big to fail, is small enough to succeed would allow people to be able to track where their dollars are being spent, and hold federal officials accountable for it.” [Walker has a meet and greet in Illinois’ 18th congressional district today accompanied by Congressional candidate Darin LaHood.] Carson leads in Iowa bucks - Federal Election Commission data shows Ben Carson outpacing the Republican field in fundraising in Iowa, Des Moines Register reports: “Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, said at first he was surprised to see Carson leading the GOP pack in terms of money raised, but it matches what he’s observed of Carson’s campaign. ‘I knew his ground game was second to none, and I know he has energy and enthusiasm among his supporters,’ he said. ‘I think Ben Carson is going to compete. I think he’s got the trifecta in terms of what it takes to win a caucus: network, enthusiasm and some dollars.’” Fiorina: Planned Parenthood vid is ‘moral’ outrage - “I’m pro-life as you know but there are plenty of pro-choice women who are horrified by this as they should be…The fact that these officials can sit here swilling their wine, eating their salad, laughing over getting a Lamborghini and talk about specimens of fetal tissue, I find horrifying and the majority of Americans do as well.…This has nothing to do with whether you're pro-choice or pro-life.” – Carly Fiorina on “Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace”. Cruz, McConnell in breakdown lane - WashEx: “The GOP ‘Old Guard’ in the Senate Sunday pushed back against outspoken conservative critics, avoiding direct attacks on Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, but making it clear his recent renegade actions are unwelcome in the upper chamber. Without saying a word, the Republican conference sent a powerful message to Cruz and other conservatives like Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, by not backing their efforts to add amendments to a ‘must-pass’ highway spending bill. ‘Deliberation and reasoned judgment require an atmosphere of restraint, an atmosphere of thoughtful disagreement,’ Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who serves as the Senate pro tempore and is the longest-serving GOP lawmaker, said in a floor speech Sunday. … Hatch delivered much of the unofficial censure Sunday, criticizing Cruz for his Senate floor speech Friday where he accused Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of 'flat-out' lying about the highway bill.” Kasich pledges 'boots on the ground' to fight ISIS - The Hill: “‘You’ve got the air power, but you can’t solve anything just with air power,” [Kasich] said in an appearance with NBC’s ‘Meet the Press,’ sharply condemning the strategy used so far by President Obama to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)…. “If we’re running for these offices just to get elected, We’re not running for class president, we’re running to be the commander in chief and the leader of this country” he said, with a laugh. ‘Grow up.’” Christie claims to be ‘only one’ who’s protected USA - Rival Republicans like military veterans Rick Perry and Lindsey Graham apparently aren’t Gov. Chris Christie’s thoughts. In a video blasting the Iran nuclear deal Christie says “As president the top priority is to protect the United States of America.” And then boasts “And I‘m the only one in this race who’s had at least a small part in that responsibility.” [Christie holds a town hall today at Lab’n Lager Food & Spirits in Keene, New Hampshire.] Huckabee, Obama duel over ‘Door of the oven’ critique - Responding to President Obama’s labeling of Huckabee’s weekend comment that the Iran nuclear deal was “marching the Israelis to the door of the oven” as “ridiculous”, the former Arkansas Gov. released a statement saying: “What’s ‘ridiculous and sad’ is that President Obama does not take Iran's repeated threats seriously. For decades, Iranian leaders have pledged to ‘destroy,’ ‘annihilate,’ and 'wipe Israel off the map' with a ‘big Holocaust.’ ‘Never again’ will be the policy of my administration and I will stand with our ally Israel to prevent the terrorists in Tehran from achieving their own stated goal of another Holocaust.” Perry to Trump: Get real - Saying the country doesn’t need a “Republican divider in chief”, former Texas Governor Rick Perry suggested Donald Trump is a headline grabber not a problem solver. ‘For the last 14 years, I’ve had to live in the real world and deal with real world issues and come up with real world solutions,” Perry told CBS News. Perry has been on the receiving end of some sharp jabs from the billionaire. ‘He put glasses on so people will think he’s smart,’ said Trump of Perry, during a speech earlier in the week. ‘And it just doesn’t work.’” Campaign Daybook: * Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is in South Carolina today where he’ll file paperwork to appear on the ballot in the First-in-the-South Presidential Preference Primary, and meet with voters and conservative activists. * Carly Fiorina delivers a foreign policy speech at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California today. * Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. attends a N.H. Primary series meet and greet in Derry, New Hampshire. THEY CAN SENSE FEAR… AND BRATWURST Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “The Milwaukee lion saga continued Sunday as the ‘lion-like’ creature apparently slipped through a police dragnet on the north side. Several sightings on Saturday night and Sunday – including at least two by Milwaukee police – followed a week of reports that began on Milwaukee's east side and riveted the attention of the city enough to draw dozens of police and state conservation officers as well as throngs of spectators hoping to get a glimpse of their own. … After the sighting Sunday morning, they made a more extensive search and called in canine units, trying to get the animal out into the open. Officers with rifles and staff from the state Department of Natural Resources with tranquilizers searched the ravine, making noise and shaking bushes. But police guess the animal broke the police barrier and headed north.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

"CONGRESSMAN, YOU’VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO DO Did you hear the one about the Democratic congressman who compared Marco Rubio to Ricky Ricardo? Probably not, unless you were glued to The Weekly Standard’s blog. But that really happened. For any Millennials who are reading, Ricardo was the character played by Desi Arnaz on “I Love Lucy.” He was a broad, mostly unflattering ethnic stereotype – a hot-tempered Cuban bandleader who would become outraged at his wife’s zany antics. Arnaz was something of a sex symbol, but certainly played his ethnicity for laughs. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., had nasty lines for nearly everyone in the GOP field, comparing Chris Christie to Jabba the Hutt, etc. Pocan at least knew enough to avoid Ben Carson. But let’s just flip this Rubio bit around and try it on for size. Imagine if a Republican congressman in 2007 had suggested then-Sen. Barack Obama should be played by J.J. “Kid Dy-no-mite” Evans from “Good Times.” Rubio’s campaign is still swinging hard against the New York Times story exploring his topsy-turvy finances prior to his national rise, honing in on the paper’s miscasting as a luxury speedboat the $80,000 fishing boat Rubio bought. But here’s a more profound outrage on which to drum. Perhaps Ted Cruz can be brought in for a consultation. For extra credit in your next class on “The Social Construction of Whiteness,” here’s a question to pose to your professor: Is the New York Times’ depiction of Rubio as an impulsive Cuban American the unwitting result of pervasive prejudice or a dog whistle? Discuss amongst yourselves. Power Play: The Times-Rubio tussle - There are upsides and downsides for Marco Rubio in his battle with the NYT. What’s the best strategic move for Rubio? Chris Stirewalt scopes out the situation in 60 seconds. WATCH HERE. “I don’t have a particular problem with this story, except the ‘Times’ may have poisoned the well a bit by saying that…Rubio had bought…what they called a luxury speedboat, which turns out to be a fishing boat.” – Senior Political Analyst Brit Hume on “The Kelly File” Team Jeb tries to reel in cash expectations - WaPo: “A super PAC backing former Florida governor Jeb Bush is likely to fall short of collecting $100 million by the end of this month, despite widespread expectations that the group would hit that record-breaking sum, according to people close to the operation…That would be a major psychological blow for Bush’s operation, whose fundraising prowess has raised expectations about how much cash it has been amassing. Bush’s schedule for the past five months has been dominated by high-priced fundraisers for the super PAC, helping the group stockpile tens of millions.” Walker touts education shakeup in Wisconsin amid tenure battle - Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., has an op-ed in the Des Moines Register touting his advances in education reform. Battles over school choice, and alternatives to traditional, often failing, public schools brought Walker into the national spotlight 3 years ago. Now the battle continues back home as the state legislature argues over tenure in the Wisconsin university system. Carly gets a hand from top pro-life leader - National Journal: “Carly Fiorina, the only Republican woman running for president in 2016, has quietly been leveraging the support of Marjorie Dannenfelser, one of the most powerful women in conservative politics. Just don't call it an ‘endorsement.’ Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a leading anti-abortion group, has played a critical role in Fiorina’s nascent 2016 run…[but] her grassroots-driven group might recoil from such a decision eight months before the first primary ballot is cast.” [Fiorina continues her three day New Hampshire tour with events in Milford and Salem.] Kasich taps McCain, Huntsman advisers - WaPo: “Kasich has picked John Weaver, a former top adviser in the presidential campaigns of Arizona Sen. John McCain, to fill the role of senior strategist. The Texas-based Weaver will oversee the general strategic direction of the Kasich campaign. Meanwhile, Fred Davis, a California-based ad maker, will assume the duties as lead media consultant for Kasich’s super PAC. He too worked for McCain’s 2008 campaign. Davis and Weaver both worked in behalf of former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr. in the 2012 campaign.” Christie hoping to be 2016’s McCain - National Journal: “Like John McCain in 2008, the New Jersey governor is holding lengthy town halls, sounding an unmistakably aggressive note on fighting terror overseas, and bluntly calling for radical reforms to entitlements, the tax code, and education at home as he seeks to make a miraculous comeback from the political doldrums… In his revamped pitch as an underdog, [Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J.] focused much more on offering conservative policies for deep-seated challenges [in New Hampshire].” [Christie is in Washington, where he’ll deliver the keynote speech at the Latino Coalition small business summit sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce.] Carson tells students to define themselves at high school named for him - Detroit News: “Ben Carson, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon who wants to be president, offered this advice to the inaugural graduating class of his namesake high school: ‘Don't let other people define you.’ Carson…was the commencement speaker Tuesday for Benjamin Carson High School of Science and Medicine’s 2015 graduating class, held at the Detroit Opera House. Carson…said, ‘When I was the first surgeon to successfully separate conjoined twins, everyone was saying it can't be done — that they'd bleed to death. But it was a success. Think beyond what other people have done. You can learn from their triumphs and mistakes.’” [Watch Fox: Presidential hopeful Ben Carson will be featured on the Contenders series on “Special Report with Bret Baier” tonight at 6 p.m. ET.] Cruz courts Hispanic Dems for open Texas primary - Texas Tribune: “…U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz came to the Rio Grande Valley on Tuesday with a less familiar task: finding a receptive audience in one of the state’s few remaining Democratic bastions…” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… There are great headlines, and then there is the best headline ever: “HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR.” Vincent Musetto of the (where else?) New York Post was the author of the paper’s April 13, 1983 main headline (known in the biz as “the wood”). How good was the wood? It has endured as the very best from a paper that can still impress with lines like “OBAMA BEATS WEINER.” Musetto died Tuesday at age 74, and the Post’s staid competitor, the NYT, gave him his due in a wonderful obituary. Said the Gray Lady: “But what endured in public memory far longer than the crime was the headline, with its verbless audacity, arresting parallel adjectives and forceful trochaic slams. (The corresponding headline in The New York Times that day proclaimed, genteelly, “Owner of a Bar Shot to Death; Suspect Is Held.” Headlessness was not mentioned until the third paragraph; toplessness not at all.).” R.I.P.

Amid mounting pressure over his Iraq war strategy, President Obama seems to be preparing to escalate U.S. involvement with hundreds more troops. The president who campaigned on getting the U.S. out of Iraq is getting back in, bit by bit. So what does Hillary Clinton think? Don’t be silly. Clinton doesn’t answer questions. Neither will she be talking much about foreign policy in the vanilla Pudding Pop of a campaign re-launch she has planned for the rest of this month. Clinton, who is raising money behind closed doors this week, is ducking two kinds of questions. The presumptive Democratic nominee’s inbox of unanswered scandal-related questions was already overflowing, but now the real-time policy points that any candidate would be expected to answer is off limits. Iraq and trade are front and center and there doesn’t seem to be a good way for her to tip-toe between distancing herself from Obama and allaying the concerns of an anxious Democratic left. [In an op-ed for Time magazine, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called for increased an increased bombing campaign.] Bernie gets feisty: ‘Hillary Clinton has had nothing to say’ - USA Today: “‘I have been ... leading the opposition to TPP,’ the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal being negotiated, [Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.] said. ‘Hillary Clinton has had nothing to say. She hasn’t given us an opinion. And it’s hard for me to understand how Secretary Clinton or any candidate can avoid speaking out on what is a huge economic issue. You can be for it; you can be against it, but you’ve got to have an opinion.’ He went on: ‘I led the effort against the Keystone Pipeline. I don’t know that Secretary Clinton has spoken out on this issue. ... I led the effort when I was in the House against the deregulation of Wall Street. ... Where is Secretary Clinton on the issue of breaking up the large financial institutions?’” What’s in there? - Bret Baier pressed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on transparency in the controversial trade authority bill, asking him why he wouldn’t release the text of the deal. “What Trade Promotion Authority is is a process to deal with it,” McConnell said, “The trade agreement will be completely transparent. We’ll have a chance to vote whether to approve it or not.” Watch the complete interview here.

NAPOLEON A JERSEY BOY? When Napoleon Bonaparte contemplated a safe haven from France after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, he decided the on United States. Where? The Garden State. NPR’s interview with Munro Price on his new book, “Napoleon: The End of Glory,” discusses this overlooked bit hypothetical history. Imagine the pocket-sized emperor passing his days near the Jersey Shore…And who knows what else might have happened if he got there? After all, New Jerseyans do like brash leaders. But, zut alors, the British blockade did not allow him to make the journey. AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “I would recommend reverse profiling.

"HOLY MELTDOWN, HILLARY! Given the breadth of her experience, you would think that Hillary Clinton’s scandal-management skills would be better by now. But instead, here we are with Clinton suddenly trailing in a New Hampshire poll just as the FBI seizes her secret email server and her lawyer’s backup files. Remember, that’s the same server that she defiantly told reporters five months ago “will remain private.” Recall that Clinton was refusing a request from Congressional investigators that she make the server available to a neutral third party for review. Clinton’s reason was that “no one wants their personal emails made public.” Well, sure. But not everyone sets up a “homebrew” server to circumvent federal email policies. And what about the rules – especially about classified information? Clinton was absolute: “I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.” As has been the case with many Clinton claims about the scandals that have steadily stalked her candidacy, that turned out not to be true. Clinton’s claim that she had destroyed the evidence – more than 30,000 emails she says were strictly personal – that she claimed would have exonerated her always sounded fishy. Wouldn’t prudence demand retaining the evidence you say would clear you? But her refusal to let anyone substantiate those claims rendered the evidence destruction argument absurd. The good news for Clinton is that the FBI investigation is focused on the least politically damaging part of the scandal: violation of the email policies themselves. It’s embarrassing for Clinton and could even end up with her facing criminal charges. But it’s far better for her to have the server in the hands of the Justice Department than of congressional investigators who would be scanning for more than just classification breaches. Being accused of letting enemies steal classified information because she wanted control over her email would be potentially debilitating, but far less so than evidence that might arise about payola allegations from her time in office. She can be happy for now that the server is in a safe place, but also has to worry what a judge might say or do. This could get out of control quickly. She can be pretty confident that her system functioned as designed and allowed for the permanent deletion of emails. But what if somebody finds a way to recover some? What if the server ends up in Trey Gowdy’s hands? And it all could have been avoided. Had Clinton agreed to an independent review months ago, or, even better, at the time she first surrendered what she says are all of her work emails, this would be long in the rearview mirror. Instead, Clinton is being publicly dragged to the place were good sense should have taken her from the beginning and she arrives with her earlier claims and her reputation for accountability in tatters. Hillary Clinton touts the history-making nature of her candidacy. One milestone she obviously hadn’t expected to need to make: First major-party nominee to win while the subject of a federal criminal investigation. Hey, look over there - WSJ: “The former secretary of state has dispatched her advisers to speak with medical professionals and substance-abuse advocates as the campaign develops policy proposals during the coming months. On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton offered only broad prescriptions at the town hall event in Keene, saying that she wants to learn from the experts about what works.” O’Malley cites legal issues with DNC debates - WaPo: “As part of an escalating feud with the Democratic National Committee, longshot presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley on Tuesday released a memo from a campaign lawyer calling the party’s debate plan ‘legally problematic’…The memo released Tuesday takes issue with an ‘exclusivity’ requirement, under which any Democratic candidate who participates in a non-sanctioned debate could be barred from the DNC-sponsored debates, the first of which is in October.” TAKE FIVE: WHAT DO YOU SAY?

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Fragments discovered from an old map may have led scientists on the path to solve the mystery of the “Lost Colony.” In 1587, John White brought a group of settlers to the New World in what is now North Carolina. White then returned to England for supplies, and when he returned to the colony in 1590 everyone was gone. There is no historical documentation that explains what happened to this colony, but scientists announced Tuesday that they are much closer to knowing than ever before. That examination of older maps show an original plan for the city of Raleigh, in what is now the rural community of Merry Hill, N.C. Finding several artifacts in the area, scientists believe the colonists left the original colony in waves and settled in this region. Why and what happened after the move remains unknown, but further research of these items provide promising clues. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

As part of a detailed foreign policy plan, Bush said the U.S. may need to send more ground troops into Iraq to defeat Islamic State militants, but added “a major commitment of American forces” was not needed. Hitting his Democratic rival’s vulnerable record as former secretary of state, Bush presented a broad plan to re-engage in the Middle East, and resolved to deal with threats “before they become catastrophes.” “Who can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the president and Secretary Clinton - the storied “team of rivals’ - took office?” Bush said. “So eager to be the history-makers, they failed to be the peacemakers.” Jeb clinches key endorsements - Reno Gazette-Journal: “U.S. Sens. Dean Heller, R-Nev., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have endorsed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for president. The endorsements will be officially given at a noon rally Wednesday for Bush in Reno.” [Stephen Colbert tweeted: “.@JebBush will be on #LSSC Sept. 8! My first GOP candidate! Luckily I do 200 shows a year, so I think I can fit them all.” Walker = Coolidge? - Jon Gabriel of Ricochet writes that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s position as a boring, Midwestern guy could be his greatest strength. Instead of a political celebrity for a president, Gabriel says people want to return to “normalcy.” To a president who isn’t at the center spotlight of every issue, but who just does his job and stays out of their way. He writes, “If Scott Walker is able to capitalize on that mood — starting with a definition of what ‘normal’ even means anymore — the White House chef might need to stock up on hot ham and rolls.” [Walker won a Twitter throwdown with Hillary Clinton over college costs.] Strong debate performance boosts Rubio - WaPo: “[Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.] donors say they have been flooded with calls, texts and e-mails in recent days from uncommitted patrons now eager to make and bundle contributions to help him. In addition, his comments against abortion during the debate have also allowed Rubio to emerge as one of the GOP’s leading voices on the issue — drawing sharp criticism from Clinton, which is always a plus in the Republican primary.” Kasich riding high in N.H. - With a new poll showing him surging into third place in New Hampshire, Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, scored a major Granite State endorsement. Tom Rath, former state attorney general, will join as national adviser and co-chairman to the campaign, according to Kasich’s campaign. Rath has served as senior adviser on several presidential campaigns including that of former President George W. Bush. [Kasich has a pair of events in New Hampshire concluding with a meeting with the Belknap County Republicans. Kasich picked up the endorsement of the County Sheriff, Craig Wiggin on Tuesday.] Trump says he’ll do well with Hispanics - Detroit Free Press: “Trump brought his campaign to Michigan Tuesday after several days of media attention focused on his statements about women and Latinos…He said he’ll build up the military, get rid of Obamacare, scuttle the Iran nuclear deal and compared his run for presidency to his former NBC television show, The Apprentice, noting people were skeptical about the show, but it went on be hugely successful.” Cruz set to release bundler names - WaPo: “Sen. Ted Cruz will release the names of people who are raising money for his presidential campaign, a reversal of the campaign’s earlier stance…A Cruz spokesman said there is no timetable for releasing the names. Fellow Republican candidate Jeb Bush plans to release the name of his bundlers. Candidates are only required to release the names of lobbyist bundling for them.” [Cruz continues his Southern states bus tour today in Arkansas, with stops in Little Rock, Russellville and Van Buren.] PACs keep failing candidates viable - Wash Ex’s David Drucker writes that today’s PACs keep candidates alive when they would normally be forced to drop out. Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal are two cases in the 2016 cycle that best show this at work. Drucker writes, “Austin Barbour, the Republican strategist behind Opportunity and Freedom PAC, told the Washington Examiner that his organization is adjusting its strategy after news that Perry is short on cash… Barbour said Opportunity and Freedom PAC is building a ground game operation to keep Perry viable.” Carson heads to the Big Apple - Ben Carson is in New York today where he is set to deliver remarks to Queens County Republicans. Carson will also go to Sylvia’s Queen of Soul Food Restaurant on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem. [Watch Fox: Ben Carson appears on “Your World with Neil Cavuto” today at 4 p.m.] Christie signs taxpayer pledge - Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, which commits to, “oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.” President of Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist, praised Christie saying, “Governor Chris Christie has vetoed more tax hikes than any other Governor in modern American history…And he made those vetoes stick. Without the Christie governorship, New Jersey would be somewhere between Detroit and Greece.” THEY DO WEAR MASKS… First it was moose and squirrel and now there’s a new animal enemy. The Russia-boosters at Pravda are keeping an eye on a new threat in Ukraine. That’s right: raccoons. Pravda: “The Ukrainian Armed Forces may soon have new soldiers, and those soldiers will be raccoons. Reportedly, the animals will be used for combat engineering purposes. The work to train the animals look for mines are already being conducted in the Kharkov region of Ukraine. In one of the military units of Kharkov, there is a raccoon named Hook. Dog handlers have picked a female for the raccoon - a female raccoon named Alice. After the animals produce offspring, they will be taught to search for explosives.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “On this issue today, it’s not only [Hillary Clinton’s] trustworthiness, it’s the fact that nothing she says ever is true three weeks later. She says there was nothing classified and I know how to do that, I know the process, and then it was revised to nothing that at the time was classified. Well, now we’re learning that it is quite probable that actually at the time it was, and she should have known it even if she’ll claim, obviously, that she didn’t.” – Charles Krauthammeron “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"Hillary Clinton is to lay out her plan today for free college at government schools. It’s noteworthy that Clinton claims her plan costs exactly half – $350 billion – of what Bernie Sanders’ proposal.","1635","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"The posture here is that Clinton is the candidate who has the same goals as Sanders – in this case, making college a right, like primary and secondary education – but can attain them in a more responsible way. Her message to the party is that free college isn’t free to taxpayers, aka voters, and support for outlandish measures will be a killer come next fall. Her call to her party base: Be reasonable, people.","1636","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"Good luck with that.","1637","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"In a party that is in the process of disowning its father and in which even socialist Sanders gets silenced by liberal activists, the idea that Clinton can squelch the populist uprising with some triangulation (definitely scalene in nature) is as ridiculous as the thought that Jeb Bush could shoo Donald Trump out of the GOP race with a white paper on border security.","1638","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

"If Sanders can pack nearly 30,000 souls into a Portland, Ore. arena it’s fair to say that he is doing even better than Trump into harnessing the outrage that animates voters, particularly older, white ones, who believe that America is truly at the abyss. And remember that both Trump and Sanders share the view that a conspiracy between business and politics is at the core of the problem.","1640","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

Many of these museums are owned by the Smithsonian Institution, named for British scientist James Smithson whose fortune created the largest museum complex in the world.

Some speculate family squabbles, while others say it was Smithsonian’s love of knowledge, but whatever the reason this donation can be considered among America’s greatest treasures.

"TRUMP EXPANDS ATTACKS","1657","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"Donald Trump stayed swinging Sunday, but broadened his field of targets to include the only woman in the GOP field, Carly Fiorina. Trump posted on Twitter, “I just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache. She has zero chance!” This after Fiorina continued to ding Trump for his disparaging comments about Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. Women aren’t the only ones to face the Trump wrath, however, former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., also joined the list with Trump attacking Bush for being… insensitive to women. Trump said on CBS News, “I watched Jeb Bush last week talking about women’s health issues like they don’t exist. I couldn’t believe what he said.” Trump added, “I want to help women.”","1658","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"But he’s said to be “getting serious” - POLITICO reports that Trump headquarters is buckling down after a rough PR weekend. The campaign is making hires in the early states and organizing policy positions set to release this week.","1659","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"Jeb cheered, jeered at Red State - Wash Ex: “During the presidential debate on Thursday, conservatives gathered at the RedState watch party vehemently booed Bush. A few even shouted obscenities as he spoke about immigration and Common Core educational standards. But he received a standing ovation from a majority in the audience on Saturday and got loud applause for taking on [Donald Trump].”","1660","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"Walker talks Ferguson, race relations - Spartanburg Herald Journal: “Republican presidential candidate and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker received a warm reception during campaign stops in Spartanburg and Gaffney on Sunday...Walker also talked about the one-year anniversary of Michael Brown’s shooting death in Ferguson, Mo., at the hands of Officer Darren Wilson and the racial tension that followed in many communities over policing. Walker said if the nation focused on racial discord it would only lead to more racial discord.”","1661","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"Cruz southbound - In his latest stop on the “SEC” primary trail, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stopped in Alabama delivering a thundering speech on his first steps in office including an investigation into Planned Parenthood. What he wouldn’t do? Knock friend Donald Trump. Cruz said he believes every candidate should be treated with, “civility and respect.”","1662","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

"Fiorina funding fire - Fox News: “Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said Sunday that her breakout performance during the last week’s debates has created a surge in support and that she can ascend to win the party nomination. “The truth is the race has just started,’ Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, told “Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace”…the exposure was key to her campaign because as a first-time presidential candidate she lacked name recognition, Fiorina said. ‘It was a big night for me…Only 40 percent of Republicans had heard my name. … There’s been an uptick in financial support, in support generally.’”","1665","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"
"Carson powers up from the pulpit - Ben Carson showed why he remains so high in the polls this Sunday with a stop at an Iowa church. He told the story of how God healed his anger as a young man, and how that healing is what the country needs. He said, “I don’t think there’s anybody who can deny that our land right now is in need of God’s healing hands.” The story, along with quotes from scripture, clearly moved the congregation, and show why Carson continues to rank high in the polls.","1666","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/10/sanders-trumps-hillary.html"

"GOP DEBATE BUZZER BEATER IN CLEVELAND? CLEVELAND — With just hours to go before the first presidential debate of the 2016 cycle a spate of new polls have shown up just ahead of the deadline. Invitations to the Fox News/Facebook/Ohio Republican Party debate will be based on the most recent, methodologically sound polling of national Republican primary voters. In addition to a fresh poll from Fox News, pollsters for CBS News, and Bloomberg have dropped surveys ahead of the final tabulations. The polls all agree that Donald Trump is a center-stage participant in the 9 p.m. ET debate for the top ten. And for perennial top-flight candidates like Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul, knocking them off that stage would take a statistical cataclysm. But for three candidates — Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Rick Perry — they can’t yet be sure whether they will be on at 9 p.m. or with the rest of the herd at a 5 p.m. Will there be more data today? The clock is ticking. -- INBOX ALERT: THIS EVENING, FOX NEWS FIRST WILL PUBLISH THE LIST OF INVITEES FOR BOTH DEBATES -- UPDATED REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE: GOP NOMINATION Donald Trump, 23.2 percent; Jeb Bush, 12.8; Scott Walker, 10.6; Ben Carson, 6.6; Mike Huckabee, 6.6; Ted Cruz, 6.2; Marco Rubio, 5.2; Rand Paul, 4.8; Chris Christie, 3.4; John Kasich, 2.8; Rick Perry, 2.0; Rick Santorum, 1.4; Bobby Jindal, 1.2; Carly Fiorina, 1.0; Lindsey Graham, 0.4; George Pataki, N/A; Jim Gilmore N/A. [Invitations to the Fox News Channel/Facebook/Ohio GOP debate are not based on the Real Clear Politics average, but rather the five most recent national surveys as of 5 p.m. today that meet Fox News’ methodological standards.] GOP frontrunners brace for Thursday - Wash Ex’s David Drucker says that underdogs will be on the hunt for any opportunity to take down a leading contender. And in the early debates anything is possible. As he writes, “The first nationally televised debate offers underdogs for the GOP presidential nomination their first direct opportunity to knock a leading candidate down a peg, if not out of the running altogether.” SIXTEENERS WARM UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE The Voters First Forum in Manchester, N.H. was the largest cattle call of the Republican nominating process to date, but it may have been more notable for the absence of one candidate: Donald Trump. Trump refused to participate citing an unflattering article in one of the newspapers sponsoring the forum. Aside from Trump’s boycott, most of heat came from a gang tackle attack on Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. “As to the Clintons, I’ve been dealing with this crowd for 20 years. I’m fluent in Clinton-speak. You want me to translate that? When he says, Bill says, ‘I didn’t have sex with that woman, he did.” – Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Jeb makes pitch to Southern Baptists - AP: “Bush travels to Nashville [today] for a live interview before thousands of members of the Southern Baptist Convention, which will also show a pre-recorded interview with Rubio. Organizers said leading GOP and Democratic presidential candidates were invited in May to participate; only Bush and Rubio accepted.” [While slurping on an Orange Julius at a stop in Iowa, Bush said he lost 40 pounds in 6 months on the “Paleo” diet.] Walker donor has ties to arena deal - TIME: “On the day before Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker launched a push this spring to spend $250 million in public funds on a new arena for the Milwaukee Bucks, the super PAC promoting Walker’s presidential campaign received a large check. The May 27 donation to Unintimidated PAC, for $150,000, came from a limited liability corporation connected to Jon Hammes, a Milwaukee-area businessman and investor in the NBA franchise…It’s not clear that the deal brought any political benefits for Walker’s presidential campaign.” “I think part of the reason why I’m polling in second is because people think I’m a fighter…I’m the only one in this race who shown consistently on the common sense conservative forums that I can win either in a blue state. I can clearly fight and win in America.” – Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., on “The Kelly File.” Watch here. Doomsday prepper, Rubio keeps building delegate bank - Oregonian: “Shawn Lindsay, a former Republican state representative from Hillsboro, has been chosen to chair Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s GOP presidential campaign in Oregon, the Rubio campaign announced Monday. Lindsay is an intellectual property lawyer and served as Mitt Romney’s Oregon chairman in 2012.” Kasich snags key N.H. endorsement - Cleveland Plain-Dealer: “Ohio Gov. John Kasich picked up the endorsement of a key Republican leader. State Rep. Jack Flanagan, the majority leader in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, cited Kasich’s success in Ohio and conservative budget policies as the reasons for his support.” [Kasich tours an internet services company in Manchester, N.H. today] Carly says shut down the government to defund Planned Parenthood - On the Hugh Hewitt Show Monday, Carly Fiorina said that the GOP should shut down the government if it would defund Planned Parenthood. She said, “They should close the government down…We have to hammer the Democrats on this, honestly their position, which most Americans do not understand... it is not a life until it leaves the hospital... most Americans to no agree with that position.” SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 GOP POWER INDEX “I think things will shake out a little clearer once Trump sticks his foot in his mouth and then shoots himself in the foot (hopefully in that order).” – Paul Papadakis “Totally agree with your GOP Power Index rankings, especially the placement of Carly Fiorina. She is smart, bold, and focused, and is a compelling contrast to Hillary Clinton. Matched with Jeb’s gravitas and resources, a Bush-Fiorina ticket would be awesome!” – Mary Heller “John Kasich is my all around fav for the long haul. His resume is, indeed, impressive. He played a key role in delivering a balanced budget while in Congress.” – Tom Fox WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… NPR: “…Military needs have driven food-preservation experiments for centuries. Canning, or bottling, was invented at the turn of the 19th century, when the French army offered a reward for someone who could invent a way to keep foods longer…But as author Anastacia Marx de Salcedo writes, the U.S. Army has taken this research to a whole other level. She says many food innovations trace back to the Natick Soldier Systems Center, a U.S. Army research complex in Natick, Mass. The federal laboratory investigates how to make soldiers’ rations taste good and last longer. She says its initiatives have led to the processed cheese that’s now found in goldfish crackers and Cheetos. The center is also behind longer-lasting loaves of bread and the energy bar, which was originally created to give worn-out soldiers a boost, she says.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Clinton released a web video in defense of her longtime political backer and America’s leading abortion provider. Clinton attacked Republicans attempts to defund Planned Parenthood, name-checking Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., and former Govs. Rick Perry, R-Texas, and Jeb Bush, R-Fla, accusing Republicans of mounting a “full-on assault on women’s health.” [Clinton campaigns and raises cash in Colorado today.] Christie not shy in pro-life defense - In a web video response, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J. says: “I don’t believe taxpayer money should be going to Planned Parenthood. Now Secretary Clinton, why don’t you answer this question: Do you support the conduct of Planned Parenthood in the killing of children in the womb in a way that maximizes their body parts for sale on the open market? Secretary Clinton, answer that question. I just did.” Sanders touts treats in new video - Sen. Bernie Sanders’, I-Vt., lengthy video “Progress” emphasizes his populist campaign theme seeking: free public university education, universal healthcare, and wealth redistribution. Sanders highlights his working-class roots in Brooklyn, N.Y., and how he realized the importance of financial stability from a young age. Sanders’ unlikely political climb was also depicted drawing a sharp contrast with Hillary Clinton. TAKE FIVE: WHAT DO YOU SAY?

GRACE ALONE WKMG: “[Melbourne, Fla.] police arrested a man who they say tried to rob churchgoers during a sermon, but was tackled by the church pastor. John Grace was arrested and charged with armed robbery and 20 additional charges in the Sunday morning incident at The Door Christian Fellowship Church on East Melbourne Avenue. Pastor Les Snodgrass tells Local 6 Grace had attended his church services before but was hardly a regular. During his sermon on ‘The Value of Life,’ he said Grace stood up and showed a gun…‘I just pushed against the wall with all my might,’ [Snodgrass said]. ‘I had him by the shoulders, and as soon as I did that, my son leapt from the platform into the air and pounced on him. He punched him twice in the head.’ Snodgrass said his wife held a stun gun to Grace until Melbourne police officers arrived and arrested him.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “For Obama, if you have your own Vice President pick up the legacy, win the election in a way it is an endorsement of the Obama presidency. I think that would please him and I am sure that like others among Democrats they are not quite sure about Clinton and how she would carry on. So I think there‘d be a lot of support for him, much more than we would have expected 6 months ago.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Watch here.

"2016 GOP POWER INDEX: PAUL FIGHTS HIS WAY DOWN Sen. Rand Paul is in step with his party on most issues. He’s pro-life, a big backer of gun rights, a small-government conservative and he’s an unabashed critic of President Obama and Hillary Clinton. And yet, Paul is again in the spotlight talking about his disagreements with his own party. For months, Paul has been focused on reducing criminal penalties for drugs. Last week, he blamed GOP hawks for the creation of ISIS. Now, he has succeeded in pulling off a one-man blockade of the Patriot Act. Like his other views, Paul’s stand is no doubt sincere and he couldn’t control the timing of the deadline. But even if he’s not acting out of political calculation, Paul’s obstruction is also no doubt necessary given his core supporters’ views on the subject. Presumably, the current effort will cement his status as the real libertarian in the race. But how will that help him grow his stagnant 7 percent? Conservatives generally share Paul’s concerns about over-broad surveillance, but that doesn’t mean that they will like what he’s doing. Even some voters disposed to like Paul are uneasy. Paul, who suggested some of his critics were hoping for a terrorist attack during the Patriot Act lapse as fodder for political attacks against him, clearly sees himself as a man locked in an epic struggle with wicked people. Paul could take credit for the changes that will be made once his procedural efforts expire, but instead he is casting himself in a similar, if less damaging, role that Ted Cruz filled during the 2013 ObamaCare government shutdown. Attacking him has become a cottage industry for hawks in general and neo-conservatives in particular. It’s hard to imagine Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., debuting his long-shot bid today without Paul in the race, and Graham and others will do their best to keep Paul pinned down defending his national security stances. And like his father in his 2008 and 2012 runs, Paul will become a piñata for other second-tier candidates looking to grab a headline or demonstrate foreign policy bona fides. Paul can grab attention and he can be heard above the din of a crowded GOP field. But if he wants the GOP nomination, he will have to find a way to use those gifts to turn his fight back toward Democrats or he will become a marginal figure in fast fashion. 2016 GOP Power Index: 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Scott Walker; 3) Marco Rubio; 4) Ted Cruz; 5) Carly Fiorina; 6) John Kasich [+2]; 7) Rand Paul [-1]; 8) Ben Carson [-1]; 9) Mike Huckabee; 10) Chris Christie On the Radar - Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki What would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index we will share the best and brightest with the whole class.

Instead of allowing Americans to collect full benefits at age 65, the former Florida governor and likely GOP presidential candidate suggested on Sunday that it should be pushed back to 68 or 70. ‘I think it needs to be phased in over an extended period of time,’ he said on CBS’s ‘Face the Nation.’”","1687","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/01/2016-gop-power-index-paul-fights-his-way-down.html"
"“This is hard for me, to be honest with you, to – I have to do the Heisman on my brother that I love. This is not something I’m comfortable doing. But I’m my own person. I have my own life experience. And I will be successful, if I’m a candidate, when I share my heart and talk about what I have done as governor of the state…” – Former Gov. Jeb Bush on CBS News. [Bush’s pseudo-campaign, Right to Rise, released a new video of Bush’s trip to Michigan last week. Bush emphasizes the need for innovation as he tours an antique car museum.] Walker says U.S. shouldn’t be ‘world’s policeman’ - Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: “Tough talk about taking on America’s foes has been a staple of Gov. Scott Walker’s rhetoric in the run-up to his likely presidential bid. But on a weekend swing here, he mixed his fighting words with some qualifiers. He’s not for ‘open-ended excursions,’ he told GOP activists on a cruise on Lake Winnipesaukee. ‘We don’t need to get into open-ended, endless engagements,’ he said at a banquet speech in Manchester. ‘I don’t think we should be the world's policeman,’ he told his audience at the Snowshoe Club in Concord. ‘I don’t think we should go in everywhere.’” Iowa’s favorite - DMR: “Scott Walker’s popularity streak in Iowa is real: He’s seven percentage points ahead of his nearest competition in the presidential horse race here, chased by a tight pack of four in a clear top tier: Ben Carson, Rand Paul, Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee.” [Walker is in Atlanta today meeting with local party leaders.] Rubio gets ready to rumble with Jeb - The always entertaining political state of Florida will not disappoint junkies this election cycle. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush loom over the other candidates in the Sunshine State leaving nothing but dark clouds for the rest of the field, but that doesn’t mean they can skip Florida entirely (here’s looking at you Scott Walker). Wash Ex’s David Drucker writes that Tuesday’s jobs forum, hosted by Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is not just another Republican “cattle call,” but an important temperature taker in the most crucial 2016 state. It’s also the first time the two former allies have shared a stage as rivals. Cruz : ‘Tom Brady was framed’ - Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, squeezed in a campaign stop while in Massachusetts this weekend with his wife, Heidi, for her Harvard Business School reunion. The presidential contender attended a house party fundraiser, and drew enthusiastic applause when he said, “[New England quarterback] Tom Brady was framed. Now I’m not willing to pander on much, but on that, Tom Brady was framed.” Buzzfeed has the video. Fiorina takes hard line against Common Core - WashEx: “GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina would give Common Core a failing grade. ‘Our education system is a big problem,’ the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard said on ‘Fox News Sunday.’ ‘When a Washington bureaucracy gets involved in a program, it becomes heavy-handed and standardized. It’s how Washington bureaucracy works.’ … Fiorina used China as an example of how federal involvement in education hurts the country. ‘China has put in place an education system that standardizes behavior,’ she said. ‘It is part of their regime’s oppression.’ What China has done is similar to Common Core in the United States, she said. ‘Common Core, unfortunately, limits parents' choices,’ Fiorina said. ‘It will, over time, limit our children’s options.’” [Fiorina highlights her growing popularity in Iowa and other early primary states. Watch the new video here.] Iowans liking what they see - DMR: “Even though Carly Fiorina is doing very poorly in the presidential horse race, esteem for the former tech company CEO has surged among GOP likely caucusgoers in the last four months. Just 15 percent viewed her favorably in the last Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll, in January. That has jumped to 41 percent in the May 25-29 poll.” [Fiorina heads back to California today for a four-day swing in the state, starting with a visit to Los Angeles.] Kasich set for July launch - Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, honed in on a July announcement this weekend. He has said he wouldn’t announce until after June 30th but before August…kind of leaves one option, reports the Columbus Dispatch. Kasich’s New Hampshire support from former Sen. John Sununu, R-N.H., also gives him solid support in a key early state. “I’m optimistic on the resources. I’m becoming more and more optimistic on the organization…I think I can help serve my country. I’ve got the most unique resume and a terrific record. And I have a great team of people around me.” – Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, to NBC News. [Kasich joins Neil Cavuto today on his new Fox Business Network show, “Cavuto: Coast to Coast” from noon to 2 p.m. ET as part of FBN’s new lineup. Cavuto’s kickoff also includes Retired Gen.

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Americans once saw space exploration as a new frontier, the same optimistic, competitive concept that drove Old World explorers and New World settlers. But the rationale for space travel has taken a darker turn in recent years, focused increasingly on the need for a new home for our species. NASA’s One-Year Mission is underway and when it concludes 10 months hence, scientists hope to have unlocked the secrets to long-distance space travel. New Yorker looks at the effort, which the magazine dubs “Project Exodus,” and the belief behind it: That humans may need to abandon Earth because of environmental degradation and exhausted resources. As Americans take an increasingly dim view of the future, have we developed a space program that matches a dystopian view? Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 45.3 percent//Disapprove – 50.3 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 29.3 percent//Wrong Track – 62.3 percent HILLARY TOOK BIG BUCKS FROM KEYSTONE BACKERS HuffPo: “Two Canadian banks tightly connected to promoting the controversial Keystone XL pipeline in the United States either fully or partially paid for eight speeches made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the period not long before she announced her campaign for president. Those speeches put more than $1.6 million in the Democratic candidate's pocket. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and TD Bank were both primary sponsors of paid Clinton speeches in 2014 and early 2015…Both banks have financial ties to TransCanada, the company behind the Keystone XL pipeline… Further, Gordon Giffin, a CIBC board member and onetime U.S. ambassador to Canada, is a former lobbyist for TransCanada and was a contributions bundler for Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign…. [Hillary Clinton is in New York for a trio of fundraisers, one of which is hosted by former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s, D-N.Y., ex-wife Silda Wall.] More from HuffPo: “While serving as secretary of state, Clinton said that she was ‘inclined’ to approve the pipeline. Since then, she has been mum on the issue, even as environmentalists -- with their major grassroots and money sway in the Democratic Party -- have made stopping the pipeline a priority…. Whether the U.S. government will approve further construction of the pipeline was a hot topic in each of the Q&A sessions hosted by the bank executives. And at every turn, Clinton refused to answer.” Iowa Dems worry about electability - Though a Des Moines Register Iowa poll out this weekend shows Clinton maintaining a big lead over her rivals, 66 percent of Democratic caucus-goers worry recent scandals could hurt her in the general election. O’Malley’s populist-identity rollout - WashEx’s Byron York breaks down the message behind former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley’s presidential announcement: “On one hand, his speech [Saturday] was nearly all about economic populism. On the other, the event itself, apart from O’Malley’s address, was about identity politics. The combined effect was a presidential rollout that said the former Maryland governor can compete with any Democrat when it comes to taxing the rich and breaking up the big banks, and at the same time can outrun Hillary Clinton when it comes to gay marriage and immigration.” [Ground game - O’Malley, who was back in Iowa and New Hampshire this weekend, dismissed his poor numbers in key primary state polls. “[P]eople there have seen 1 percent candidates before – get into the van, go from county to county to county and make their case about their better choices that they would offer the nation,” he told ABC News, “And suddenly become very well-known overnight when people make up their mind.”] Fifty Shades of Really Gray - The Hill: “Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on Sunday that a controversial essay he penned in 1972 discusses topics similar to the popular erotic novel 50 Shades of Gray…‘[W]hat it was dealing with was gender stereotypes, why some men like to oppress women, why other women like to be submissive,’ Sanders [told NBC News].’You know, something like 50 Shades of Gray, very poorly written 43 years ago,’ he added.” Packing them in - Sanders drew an overflow crowd on a campaign stop in Minneapolis. Minnesota Public Radio reported that thousands turned out to her the socialist icon. [Backs NSA bill - “It does not go as far as I would like it to go. I voted against the original PATRIOT Act and against the re-authorization of the PATRIOT Act…. I am not comfortable with it, but we have to look at the best of bad situations.” – Vt. Sen. Bernie Sanders to NBC News, prior to voting ‘yes’ to advancing the Freedom Act on NSA data collection.] 2016 Democratic Power Index: 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Martin O’Malley; 3)Bernie Sanders; 4) Joe Biden; 5) Elizabeth Warren; 6) Jim Webb; 7) Lincoln Chaffee THE ASPARAGUS UPRISING Fox News: “Police in rural northeastern Germany rushed out to track down a reported mob of up to 15 people armed with knives and sticks. Instead, they found a group of asparagus harvesters. Police in the town of Ludwigslust said a man called their emergency number Saturday to report having seen ‘10 to 15 people armed with knives and sticks’ on a local road. Within minutes, six police cars were on their way to the scene. Officers quickly discovered, however, that the group was asparagus harvesters walking along the road with their work tools as they went to take a lunch break. White asparagus is a popular delicacy in Germany and a ubiquitous sight on restaurant menus in late spring.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"EMAILS SHOW WEIRD WORLD OF HILLARY Did you hear? There was “no smoking gun” in the 3,000 pages of Hillary Clinton emails disgorged by the State Department on Tuesday night? There was “no incriminating evidence,” said the NYT. Since there wasn’t an email in which the then-Secretary of State wrote, “Hey guys, make sure to fake the Benghazi riot so that we can get away with this,” should we all just move on down the road? In real life, we know that while there may not be prima facie “incriminating evidence” here, they are anything but exculpatory. What we see here is a woman running a government within the government – a semi-autonomous entity with not just private email system but also privately funded, secret minister without portfolio, speechwriter, intelligence bag man and political fixer, Sidney Blumenthal. Clinton called Blumenthal an “old friend” who passed along some tips “unsolicited.” That simply is not the true according to these emails that show Blumenthal, deemed unacceptable for an administration post by the White House, carried on in a quasi-official but unaccountable capacity throughout her tenure. Making matters worse, Blumenthal was being paid by Clinton’s family foundation, which we now know was taking unreported donations from foreign governments and entities with business before Clinton and her department. What a debacle. And, in fact, one might even say that as far as gun smoke goes, there is a strong whiff of cordite around Clinton when it comes to her claims about Blumenthal. And through it all is an effort to elevate her role in the administration but not her subservience. How much of her autonomy and secrecy were the result of her own aloofness or mistrust of President Obama and his team and how much was a result of Obama shunning Clinton and her team we will likely never know. But inside the emails we get examples small and large of the depth of the dysfunction. We see Clinton passing along an email from her former campaign strategist lambasting one of the president’s speeches on Afghanistan and suggesting she ramp up her role; Clinton eyeing an email from Blumenthal touting Obama’s crumbing poll numbers in Ohio. Most telling, perhaps, is that the senior White House adviser and even the chief of staff had to go ask for Clinton’s email address many months after the administration had begun. Not only does this weaken White House claims of ignorance about Clinton’s secret, unsecure server but also shows how fraught the relationship was between the two camps. The chief of staff, the captain of the cabinet, asking permission to email a cabinet secretary? Woof. The picture that comes into focus is of a woman who did not join a team of rivals, but persisted in an exile partly by the sentence of the president and partly of her own making. A remarkable moment comes when Clinton, obviously peeved, tells her staff that she has been called to the White House a second time for a meeting that was cancelled. Another time she hears of a cabinet meeting on the radio (!) and writes to her team to ask if it is so and if she can go. People have compared the Clintons many times to the ruthlessly effective Underwoods of “House of Cards.” In this batch of emails we see a figure much more like the lead character of another show: Selina Myer of “Veep.” [“In thinking about the Kissinger interview, the only issue I think that might be raised is that I see POTUS at least once a week while K saw Nixon every day…” – Hillary Clinton in an email to her staff.] Lights, camera... Hillary - Filmmaker Doug Sain, who co-produced the 2012 documentary ""2016: Obama's America"" is now turning his energies toward the Clintons in a new film, ""Clinton, Inc. the Movie."" The Clinton flick will be based on Daniel Halper's book ""Clinton Inc.: The Audacious Rebuilding of a Political Machine."" Still in the development phase, Sain reportedly hopes to complete the film by the end of the year and release it in 2016, as Clinton looks to lock up the Democratic nomination for president. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… The New Yorker tells the story of Koji Kondo, a Japanese prog-rock fan and composer who heard the sound of possibility in early video games. He went to work at Nintendo in 1984, with the goal of enriching the gamer’s experience. Rather than just “hailing” players, he wanted the music to be in tune with what the player is feeling at various points of play: tension, struggle, triumph, etc. And rather than arcade-style music designed to attract attention, Kondo sought to compose scores the deepened and enriched the experience for the new home-console market. The results were revolutionary. New Yorker: “Focussing on Kondo’s much-loved score for Super Mario Bros. – and offering a brief detour through his Deep Purplish soundtrack for The Legend of Zelda – [author Andrew Schartmann] brings readers into a world of visionary musicians producing beloved masterpieces in almost total obscurity. Could it be that the largely unknown Kondo, Nintendo’s first dedicated sound designer, was one of the great innovative forces of our time?” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 46.4 percent//Disapprove – 49.8 Directions of Country: Right Direction – 28.6 percent//Wrong Track – 62.4 percent WALKER STAYS ATOP A REMADE IOWA RACE Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker maintained his 8-point lead from May in the Quinnipiac University poll of Iowa Republican caucus goers out this morning. While Walker lost 3 points to fall to 18 percent, it was against a dramatically altered field. The biggest change was the arrival of real-estate developer and pageant organizer Donald Trump who debuted at 10 percent in his first inclusion in the poll. Trump is tied with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who recovered from a springtime stumble with a 3-pouint gain. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also returned to a happier place to climb 3 points back to 8 percent. The other winners were businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who bumped up a point to 3 percent, and the Ricks (Perry and Santorum) who both climbed back to 4 percent. On the other side of the ledger, the biggest losers were Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Rubio saw his support nearly halved from May, finishing at 7 percent. Huckabee, a longtime Iowa favorite, had been holding steady in the top tier with 11 percent since February but skidded to 5 percent and eighth place. It appears that he, like Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, suffered more than most from the arrival of Trump and perhaps the revival of Carson. Cruz and Paul were tied at 9 percent each, falling 3 points and 4 points respectively. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie slipped to 1 percent in a tie for second-to-last with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. Former New York Gov. George Pataki showed no discernable support in his initial appearance in the poll. POWER PLAY: JEB GOES DEEP Jeb Bush released a whopping 33 years of tax returns. What’s the strategy behind the move and what message is the Republican frontrunner sending? Chris Stirewalt has the lowdown, in 60 seconds. WATCH HERE. Jeb earns less, pays higher tax rate tax than Clintons – AP: “[Jeb Bush] released three decades of federal tax returns on Tuesday that show he’s generated a vast fortune since leaving the Florida governor's mansion. But they also show that Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton made more in speaking fees and book royalties alone in the past year and a half than Bush and his wife earned overall in the first seven years after he left public office…[Bush’s returns] show he paid an effective federal income tax rate of roughly 36 percent in the past three decades and made roughly $27.7 million in total income between 2007 and 2013. By comparison, the Clintons’ earnings exceeded $30 million combined in speaking fees and book royalties between January 2014 and May 2015, according to a personal financial disclosure Clinton filed earlier this year. In that time, the Clintons paid a tax rate of more than 30 percent.” Rubio blasts Obama on Cuba relations - Calling President Obama’s announcement today restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba a “prized concession” to the Castro regime, Sen. Marco Rubio asks: What is the U.S. getting in return? “It remains unclear what, if anything, has been achieved…in terms of securing the return of U.S. fugitives being harbored in Cuba, settling outstanding legal claims to U.S. citizens for properties confiscated by the regime, and in obtaining the unequivocal right of our diplomats to travel freely throughout Cuba and meet with any dissidents, and most importantly, securing greater political freedoms for the Cuban people. I intend to oppose the confirmation of an Ambassador to Cuba until these issues are addressed,” Rubio said in a statement. Kelly File: Cruz defends court sacking -“The framers wrote about judicial overreach quite a bit. They believed the check would be impeachments. Now, here is the sad reality. Within a few decades, Thomas Jefferson said, impeachment had been not even a scarecrow. Even 200 years ago, the Supreme Court wasn't afraid of it. Today, we have a United States Senate. We can't even muster 50 votes to defeat Loretta Lynch, an attorney general who tells us she is not going to follow the law or the constitution. There is no universe in which there are 67 votes to remove Anthony Kennedy from the Supreme Court.” – Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on “The Kelly File” [Ted Cruz kicks off his book tour with a pair of stops in the Houston area.] Christie’s Maine man - Asbury Park Press: “Gov. Chris Christie interrupts his New Hampshire campaign swing with a side trip to [Portland] Maine this morning, where it appears he may pick up an endorsement for his 2016 bid. [H]e’ll take part in a ‘special announcement event’ at Becky's Diner at 10 a.m. Christie made a campaign stop at that diner with Maine Gov. Paul LePage in May 2014, one of Christie’s five visits to Maine as Republican Governors Association chairman to help LePage win re-election. The RGA also spent $5 million on the race. The special announcement could be an endorsement by the bombastic LePage. Christie told a Maine television station, in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, that he'd be meeting with LePage today. [After his side trip to Maine, Christie picks up the pace in New Hampshire with a house party in Bristol and a town hall meeting in Ashland. He’ll remain in the Granite State through Saturday.] More endorsements for Carly - Union Leader: “Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina on Tuesday announced 20 additional endorsements and members of her leadership committee in New Hampshire.” Carson hits debt, immigration in N.C. - Asheville (N.C.) Citizen-Times: “The economic collapse that will eventually result from the national debt if action isn’t taken will make the stock market crash that set off the Great Depression ‘look like a cakewalk,’ Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson said [Tuesday]…. Carson told the crowd of more than 800 [in Fletcher, N.C.] that the United States should end immigration, reduce government regulation and go to a 10 percent tax rate based on the biblical tithe with no deductions or loopholes. And he told the crowd not to succumb to political correctness ‘because that's how (progressives) control you.’” Wielding veto pen, Kasich signs Buckeye budget - Cleveland Plain Dealer: “Gov. John Kasich signed a $130.3 billion budget bill Tuesday that will govern Ohio's spending the next two years, but not before using his line-item veto to eliminate 44 provisions….The GOP-authored budget -- supported by just one Democrat, Rep. Martin Sweeney of Cleveland -- provides a 6.3-percent, across-the-board state income tax cut as well as tax deductions for business owners. That reduces Ohio's income-tax rate from 5.33 percent to 4.99 percent for residents making more than $200,000 per year — a top rate not seen since 1982, according to lawmakers.” Santorum gets PAC boost - A new super PAC, “Working Again PAC” backing Rick Santorum is up and running today. The group is run by Nadine Maenza, Santorum’s chief fundraiser for his 2012 campaign. “Rick Santorum, who won 11 states and 4 million votes in 2012, is the only candidate in the race for the White House with an understanding of the challenges working Americans face.” Maenza said in a release announcing the PAC’s formation. CAMPAIGN DAYBOOK * Rand Paul is meeting and greeting his way across Western Iowa today with events in Council Bluffs, Sioux City and Okoboji. * Bobby Jindal visits a senior center and holds a town hall meeting in Council Bluffs, Iowa. * Lindsey Graham is in Iowa for a meet and greet in Fort Dodge and a town hall in Mason City. REALLY NATURAL CHILDBIRTH Amber Pangborn, a pregnant mom from Oroville, Calif. went to visit a friend at a casino but ended up finding good luck elsewhere. She apparently decided to take a shortcut home through a nearby national forest. Oops. Pangborn’s mother told the LAT that her daughter, a mother of three already, said she made a wrong turn, ran out of gas in a remote spot without cell service and promptly went into labor. Pangborn, who was nine months along, said she delivered her daughter on her own. But having made it through that ordeal, her trial was just beginning. Pangborn said she was chased by a swarm of bees, and got multiple stings while shielding her child. Then, in an attempt to summon help, she started a fire, which quickly grew out of control in the drought-wracked forest. Pangborn fled the fire she set and met firefighters rushing to fight the blaze. Mom and baby are doing well and the paper walked away with an early frontrunner for headline of the year: “Woman gives birth, fights off bees, starts wildfire in Northern California.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"HILLARY OUTRUNNING HER OWN PRIVILEGE Can Hillary Clinton be this bad at running for president and still get away with it? For now, the answer would appear to be yes. But we are starting to see her reaching the tether of the privileges associated with being a president’s wife, her party’s 2008 runner-up and the beneficiary $2 billion campaign apparatus. It’s still her turn on the Democratic side, but an awful lot of Democrats are coming to wish there was another way. The latest Fox News poll shows Clinton losing 10 points of her lead since last month on Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders still trails by 19 points and isn’t going to be overtaking her anytime soon, but that’s kind of the point. For all her months of working and fighting and pandering, she’s still losing ground to a guy who complained about excessive deodorant choice in the American supermarket. And she certainly gives Democrats ample reason. Clinton, whose conduct as secretary of state is currently the subject of a federal criminal probe, joked in Iowa on Friday “You may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account,” she said. “I love it. I love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.” Ugh. The team of writers who worked on that joke should be fired, en masse. Like George W. Bush’s jokes about the search for the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, it wasn’t that it was too soon, it was that it would never be funny. In Clinton’s worldview, her shady email antics are but a distraction. She’s wrong. Given the ethical allegations against Clinton plus the controversies surrounding her time in office, especially her Libya misadventure, hiding emails is serious stuff. And as the poll shows, 58 percent of registered voters believed she lied about having classified material on her private server. Fifty-four percent said doing so put national security at risk. Ha-ha-ha… More telling, though, is what Clinton said to reporters about the widening FBI probe of her security practices. Clinton said she would “let whatever this inquiry is” run its course and not get distracted because that’s not what voters are asking her about. Good grief! So not only does the candidate denigrate the investigation while it is ongoing but also supposes that because of what people pre-selected by her campaign for human interaction say to her it’s not resonating with voters. If they were picking panda bears for her to nuzzle instead of Iowans, one assumes Hillary would be consumed with talk of delicious, leafy tender baby bamboo. Mmmmm, bamboo… If the other candidate of privilege, Jeb Bush, were this bad at running for president he would have already had to quit the race. And anyone else would have had to have fled the country. If Clinton really is this bad as a candidate, there is no amount of money or power that can rescue her. Democrats will instead have to place all of their hopes on a complete Republican meltdown. So at least they’ve got that going for them… Reporter leaves no turn unstoned - Politico reports that the Democratic donors Biden would “need to be viable appear to be ruling him out” based on the responses of people who attended a Hillary Clinton fundraiser on Martha’s Vineyard. The reporter must next be headed to Wrigley Field to see who’s picking the Cardinals for the World Series. 2016 Democratic Power Index: Joe’s back from the beach - 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Joe Biden [+1]; 3) Bernie Sanders [-1]; 4) Martin O’Malley; 5) Jim Webb; 6) Elizabeth Warren; 7) Lincoln Chaffee; 8) Al Gore [previously unranked] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… One hundred years ago this day, Charles F. Kettering was issued a patent on a gadget that made daily life for Americans less cranky, literally. The DELCO co-founder’s “engine-starting device” was the first electric ignition device for automobiles. As History.com describes, “In the early years of the automobile, drivers used iron hand cranks to start the internal combustion process that powered the engines on their cars. In addition to requiring great hand and arm strength, this system was not without certain risks: If the driver forgot to turn his ignition off before turning the crank, the car could backfire or roll forward...By making cars easier and safer to operate, especially for women, the self-starting engine caused a huge jump in sales, and helped foster a fast-growing automobile culture in America.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

The big winners in the Fox News poll out Sunday were primarily identified as outsiders. Donald Trump remained in first place, but with some suggestion that his support may have peaked as his vote share held steady and respondents who watched the debate judge him to have done the worst. He is also the most disliked among GOP primary voters. With a new immigration policy proposal that makes Mitt Romney’s self-deportation sound like trip to the spa, Trump will continue to shape the race by setting the marker for (presumably) the ultra-restrictive position in the field. But there’s no indication that he’s done much to broaden his appeal. Not so for Sen. Ted Cruz, who is running as a more practical version of Trump. Cruz got back into the top tier for the first time since immediately after his launch and, given his deep pockets, large organization and the failures of competitors like Sen. Rand Paul (down to 3 percent from steady double-digits this spring), it is again possible to imagine the Texas senator being in contention when the GOP gets to the home stretch for the nomination in March. Cruz may have been in politics and government off and on for 20 years, but his torch work in Washington clearly identifies him as an outsider’s insider. However, the candidates who benefitted the most from the exposure of debate night are clearly those with the least political experience in the field: Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. While candidates like Trump and Jeb Bush came to the process already famous, Carson and Fiorina are little known in the political space. Having tens of millions of people tune in has limited upside for candidates already known to all, but as Carson and Fiorina show, big potential for those they are getting to know and might just like. As for those who are following a more traditional path to the nomination, including Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio: August is why you need deep pockets. All three saw their numbers fall as attention shifted to the biggest lights from the debate. But as pressure grows on candidates like Rick Perry, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal and Lindsey Graham to abandon their bids for the good of the party, the field should sort itself out to the advantage of Bush, Walker and Rubio.

Ads are scheduled to begin in Iowa and New Hampshire on Sept. 15, in South Carolina a week later and then run continuously through the end of the year.

Scott Walker Saturday during a campaign stop at the Iowa State Fair. Trump, who has overtaken Walker as the front-runner in the crucial state in recent polls, slammed the Republican governor and his record in Wisconsin, saying ‘there's tremendous dissension all over the state.’ The real estate mogul said that economic growth under Walker has been ‘terrible.’ Trump's comments echoed attacks he has made against Walker in recent weeks. Until recently, polls showed Walker as the front-runner in Iowa and several other crucial early primary states. But several polls released in the wake of the first GOP debate have shown Walker dropping and Trump surging into a strong lead. ‘His growth is terrible in terms of the state,’ Trump said. ‘There's tremendous dissension all over the state.’” Will it wash? - Walker and Fiorina are both on the Des Moines Register soapbox at the Iowa State Fair today. [The first jury pool with a hot tub - Donald Trump today arrives for jury duty in Manhattan.] “It’s not clear to me that Donald Trump is a Republican.” – Carly Fiorina in an interview with ABC News. Carson’s Sunday strategy paying off - Des Moines Register: “Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson spent his Sunday morning at the church of a Des Moines civil rights activist. The former pediatric brain surgeon shared stories of his rise from inner-city poverty and posed solutions for a more promising future for America's youth. The Rev. Keith Ratliff, former president of the Iowa & Nebraska branch of the NAACP, called Carson an inspiration for the youth in his community. He also said Carson, the lone African-American among 15-plus viable GOP candidates, could reverse negative views some minorities hold toward the Republican Party.” Kasich snags Alabama Gov.

While Kasich is no favorite to win the state’s March 1 primary (Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich were first and second in 2012) Bentley’s backing shows a surprising Deep South strength for Kasich and might help garner some delegate count next year. Alabama Media also had this detail, which will make both men more unpopular in 48 other states: “Bentley, a University of Alabama graduate and huge Bama fan will present Kasich with a signed UA football by coach Nick Saban. Kasich, a graduate of The Ohio State University, in turn will present Bentley with a football signed by Ohio State coach Urban Meyer.” [Kasich heads to South Carolina where he will officially file to appear on the state’s Republican primary ballot.] Huck heading back to Israel - Far from walking back his comments about President Obama marching Israel to “the doors of the oven” with his Iran nuclear deal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is highlighting his connections to the Jewish state with a trip this week. Huckabee told CNN he was heading to Tel Aviv on Tuesday for fundraising and meetings with officials. Home game - Huckabee’s campaign points out that they are deeper and wider on the ground in early states than most. Huckabee’s daughter and campaign manager, Sarah Sanders, told Fox News First that while Jeb Bush’s campaign has gotten lots of attention for an expansive Iowa staff, Huckabee has more: 71 county chairs and 139 “grassroots leaders” across the state. In South Carolina, the campaign touts similar numbers. You can get the full rundown here. SHUTTLECOCKS NOT FASCISM! The Independent: “A Spanish athlete was forced to maintain a fixed smile at during a podium ceremony at the Badminton World Championships after organisers played the fascist version of her national anthem. During the ceremony in Jakarta, Indonesia Carolina Marin did not give anything away as the old lyrics to the Spanish national anthem “Royal March”, which have not been used since 1978, played alongside the music. The 22-year-old world number old smiled and pointedly looked ahead as the Spanish flag was raised to mark her victory over Indian player Salina Nehwal, the Local reports. The lyrics, composed by fascist poet Jose Maria Peman, were abandoned three years after the return to democracy after General Franco’s death in 1975.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"DEMS FACE TEST ON RADICAL ISLAM We will get to take the measure of the Democratic field today in Iowa as to whether they can address the subject of Islamist terrorism in such a way as to reassure voters that they are trustworthy. Tonight in Iowa is the party’s first candidate cattle call of the cycle (compared to 14 so far for the GOP.) And while President Obama was able to win re-election in 2012 waving the bloody tunic of Usama bin Laden, his ratings on national security have subsequently ranged from weak to abysmal.","1754","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/dems-face-test-on-radical-islam.html"
"His administration’s reticence to speak directly to the issue of Islamist militancy in the homeland, whether it at Ft. Hood or at the Mohammed cartoon contest or, now, Chattanooga, has been part of that problem. This has consequences for his party, since many in the Democratic base are extremely worried about racial profiling, cultural sensitivity and ensuring that Islamists are treated the same way as other killers. One month ago today, Republicans were faced with a similar situation when a racist lunatic murdered congregants at a black church in South Carolina. Many in the Republican base are concerned about the rise of racial politics, political correctness run amok and the demonization of the South, the geographic base of the party. But to the disappointment of Democrats, and many on the media, Republicans dealt straight away with the issue and all (or almost all) acquitted themselves with compassion, mercy and clarity. It was a big test for the party’s huge field of candidates as well as the GOP in early-state South Carolina. It was a great success. Democrats face a similar test now. Can they respond with similar clear-eyed rhetoric? If Democrats are seen as sharing the president’s posture on Islamism, it will complicate things for Hillary Clinton in a big way. But other than former-Sen. Jim Webb, is any other candidate likely to say more today than express sympathy for the families of the victims? Will anyone else be willing to confront the party’s orthodoxy and talk about radical Islam? Clinton surely doesn’t want to antagonize her base just as cracks are beginning to deepen. [Watch Fox: Senior Political Correspondent Mike Emanuel covers the state of the race for the Democrats live from Cedar Rapids, IA.] Gun-free zones under fire - The murder of unarmed U.S. Marines in Chattanooga drew swift calls to scrap federal policy establishing gun-free zones at military facilities. The ineffectiveness of the ban, enacted during the Clinton administration, was ironically underlined by pictures at one of the shooting scenes showing a bullet-ridden front entrance displaying a sign declaring it gun-free. The attack, which tragically recalls the 2009 Fort Hood shooting of unarmed soldiers the Obama administration termed “workplace violence”, has critics of the ban are asking: If our troops are going to be serially targeted by terrorists, as it now appears, shouldn’t they at least be able to carry side arms to protect themselves? [WashEx notes that earlier this month Donald Trump called for an end to gun free zones.] Time for a change - “…[T]he policies that prohibited our military personnel from being armed at an establishment like this…are outdated. Containment was something that might have been good during the Cold War, but we’re facing an enemy in radical Islamic terrorism that's willing to take the fight to us and we need to make sure that our men and women in uniform not only have the resources to protect us and keep our country safe, but they need to have the resources to keep themselves safe.” – Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., on “The Kelly File” POWER PLAY: PLANNED PARENTHOOD GAME CHANGER Undercover video of a Planned Parenthood exec talking about harvesting fetal organs has shocked the country. Given the abortion rights group’s close alignment the Democratic party, what does the uproar mean politically? Republican strategist Mercedes Schlapp and Democratic consultant Craig Varoga discuss the fallout with Chris Stirewalt. WATCH HERE. Planned Parenthood is sorry if you were offended - Fox News: “Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, defended the organization’s practices and maintained the group does not illegally sell fetal tissue. But, in a video statement [Richards said]…This is unacceptable, and I personally apologize for the staff member’s tone and statements,” Richards said. Richards does not directly name Deborah Nucatola, the group official in the video. The video was secretly recorded last year and released to the press this week by the pro-life group, Center for Medical Progress.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Fast Company: “IBM wants you to be able to tell how your tone comes across in written communications.

Donald Trump lands at 18 percent in the poll topping the list 3 points ahead of his closest competitor Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., who climbs to 15 percent, followed by former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., who holds strong at 14 percent. What about the other Floridian? Sen Marco Rubio, R-Fla., continued to slip, but seems to have stabilized. Rubio fell from 13 percent in April down to 9 percent in May. Since then he’s waivered around the high single digits. For now, it seems, Rubio has managed to hold that space, which in a field like this is an achievement in itself. The Trump effect was felt outside of the top tier where contenders like Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee and, perhaps most of all, Carly Fiorina. Power Play: Trumpedo - How damaging has Trump really been beyond the media hype? Republican strategist Mercedes Schlapp and Democratic consultant Craig Varoga give Chris Stirewalt their take. WATCH HERE. Jeb’s take on the Iran deal: legitimizing a regime with ‘blood on their hands’ - Yahoo! reporter Jon Ward talked with Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., on his take on the Iran deal. Bush said, “We also have a situation that is deeply troubling to me, which is there’s blood on their hands with American military men and women in Iraq…And to legitimize a regime that killed hundreds of American soldiers without any consequence, without any recognition that that’s something that should be troubling, is deeply disturbing to me.” And gains another Hamptons ‘money man’ - NYDN: “Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush will head on a Hamptons…with a stop at money man Ken Lipper’s East Hampton mansion... Lipper…will host Bush at an intimate brunch after the former Florida governor flies in just for the day on July 25.” This sounds familiar… - Miami Herald: “Jeb Bush is bringing back one of the phrases he loved to use as governor -- ‘Mount Tallahassee’ -- only now that he’s running for president, he’s talking about ‘Mount Washington.’ Bush plans to speak in the state capital Monday about how we would reform how the federal capital works. It’s part of a series of speeches about what his priorities would be as president, spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger said.” Walker for the win - Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: “Dealing Gov. Scott Walker a victory just as his presidential campaign gets underway, the Wisconsin Supreme Court in a sweeping decision Thursday ruled the governor’s campaign and conservative groups had not violated campaign finance laws.” Look who’s here - Boston Globe: “It was one of those only-in-New-Hampshire moments. Presidential candidates bump into each other — on a street corner. While campaigning. Luckily, Dr. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are friends, having served together on the board of the Kellogg Co.

Klein writes, “On Wednesday, America’s Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry’s largest lobbying group, announced that it had elected Marilyn Tavenner as its chief executive officer. Before joining AHIP, Tavenner led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Obama…Tavenner could be a poster child for the corrupting influences of the revolving door between industry and government that Obama once decried.” SCHLAPPED: CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ‘BROKE HIS WORD’ That’s what American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp stated in his op-ed in The Hill. On the heels of the two watershed decisions from the Supreme Court last month, Schlapp writes, “It was once unimaginable to most people to think that Chief Justice John Roberts would contradict so sharply the image he portrayed at his confirmation hearing. For example, under oath he explained, ‘You don’t look to legislative history to create ambiguity. If the text is clear, that is what you follow, and that’s binding. And you don’t look beyond it to say, well, if you look here, though, maybe this clear word should be interpreted a different way.’” AH, GERMANY… A squirrel faced police in Germany after a woman complained he was stalking her, reports NBC News. When the woman was unable to shake the rodent authorities stepped in, and found he was suffering from exhaustion. In an effort to give the animal some much needed sleep the officers fed him apple and honey tea. After recovering, the animal will be transferred to a local shelter. AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “This is in all probability an example of radical Islam at work and you know I think our emphasis on ISIS is a little overstated because we had these attacks that predate ISIS…But the general issue is radical Islam. And unless we have a president who immediately says this is a lone gunman, how does he know?” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"WEIRD SCENES AND FEVER DREAMS FROM THE SUMMER OF ‘15 The mix of frenzy and anticipated relief you see in the eyes of every parent of school-aged children tells us that the summer is rapidly drawing to a close. And so too is the summer madness in politics. Reporters have filled the internet with the kind of drivel that reveals individuals desperate to file stories so they can escape to the beach… where they will still talk constantly about politics. (But they will guzzle pink wine instead of red and thereby convince themselves that they are on vacation.) At the end of the most overheated summer of speculation since, well, the last one, we do know that some things are different this time around. The leader in the polls, billionaire businessman and reality TV star Donald Trump has some advantages that other summer flings did not: universal name identification, the ability to fund his own campaign and a gift for staying in the spotlight that few others can boast. But the biggest advantage that Trump has is something unique to this cycle: 10 other candidates mounting credible (to varying degrees) presidential campaigns. Trump is sparring for some votes with other insurgent Republicans, namely Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and, to a lesser degree, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. All three men will be campaigning in South Carolina today, a sign of things to come for what promises to be a more-insane-than-usual Palmetto stakes in February. But as Trump’s Alabama Rambler on Friday showed, he is taking seriously the need to pay attention to organization, outreach and infrastructure. While previous summer flings couldn’t build out enough organization to stick around as the weather cooled, Trump’s business empire afforded him a pop-up campaign that he is now working to build out. And it’s much tougher on the establishment favorite in the race, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Bush is contending with Walker as well, but also businesswoman Carly Fiorina, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and, most of all, his onetime protégé Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. While the establishmentarians in 2008 and 2012 had plenty of trouble subduing the more restive parts of the party, they did not have to fight long, expensive intermural bouts before getting on to the main event. And as Christie shows in a new ad out today, none of those folks is anywhere near the exits yet. Add in to the equation the fact that the Democrats still seem bound to nominate Hillary Clinton, who has proven that failure is not always a great teacher. She is running a terrible campaign and giving Republicans scant motivation these days to tighten up and get thinking about the general election. If you’re a conservative activist who thinks the Democratic nominee may be delivering her acceptance speech from a correctional facility, electability arguments will sound rather hollow. So, to say the least, it’s getting weird out there. But as one of the great political journalists of the last century said: “When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.” And with that, gentle readers, we give you the latest edition of the Fox News First 2016 GOP Power Index.

On this day in 1814, President James Madison had traveled out from Washington to Bladensburg, Md. to observe the battle between federal troops and the fast-approaching British invasion force. The American defenses were quickly overwhelmed and Madison – who at 5-feet, 4-inches and 100 pounds never saw combat in the Revolutionary War – briefly took command of one of the remaining batteries before he too was forced to flee. By nightfall, the British were in control of Washington and officers were dining in the abandoned White House. Much of the city was burned by the occupying army before the British withdrew two days later. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

HILLARY ABANDONS HAMPTONS FOR CLEVELAND Frontrunner Hillary Clinton is apparently so concerned by her email scandal – which California Gov. Jerry Brown called a “vampire” on her campaign – that she’s breaking into her Hamptons vacation for some Midwest image repair. Goodbye West Egg, hello Cleveland! She’s got a lot to worry about, too, after a weekend confab between Vice President Joe Biden and populist darling Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. WSJ reports Biden is “…increasingly leaning toward entering the race if it is still possible he can knit together a competitive campaign at this late date…Biden’s meeting with Ms. Warren fueled speculation that he is sounding out support he might receive among those at the party’s progressive base should he seek to challenge Mrs. Clinton.” With Clinton already facing serious problems among the general electorate, a Warren nod in Joe’s direction would put her presumed lock on the nomination in doubt, forcing her further to the left to shore up support of primary voters. Does this scandal have a ‘gate’ yet? - “Until we start having debates, and offering those ideas that move our country forward, we’re going to be bogged down in questions of, what did Hillary Clinton know and when did she know it?” – Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, in an interview with ABC News. The dude abides - Politico: “Biden declined an offer from the Democratic National Committee to join the party’s five declared presidential candidates in addressing the committee’s members at its summer meeting in Minneapolis this week.” Warren won’t commit to another Senate bid - The Hill: “The liberal favorite elected to the Senate in 2012 said in [a WBZ-TV] interview said that it’s too early to talk about a second term, even as she expressed frustration at getting things done in Congress… Asked if that meant she’d seek another term to the Senate, Warren put up her hands: ‘Too early to talk about that.’” NO CAUSE FOR ALARM, MA’AM. JUST A MANATEE ORGY South Florida Sun Sentinel: “Bill Tudhunter, 57, was sitting on the back patio of his Fort Lauderdale home drinking a beer and enjoying the view of the Intracoastal Waterway, as he does every evening after work, when he noticed something odd in the water. A group of nine manatees had come ashore behind the home in the 2100 block of Southeast 21st Street. In what could only be described as a dogpile, they rocked with the wake, apparently mating as they floated in a few feet of water. Unsure of what to do, Tudhunter alerted his wife, Yasmine, who called 911 as well as wildlife authorities. … Yasmine Tudhunter, 54, said that in the five years she has lived in her coastal home she has never seen anything like this. ‘I was thinking they were in trouble — that they were dying,’ she said while picking up a bucket and towels she had brought out to aid the manatees.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"Buzz Cut: • Uncovered audio: Hillary was ‘adamantly against illegal immigrants’ • Clintons on campaign cash: If disclosure ‘looks bad,’ don’t disclose • Where’s Jeb? The whale is getting ready to surface • Can Cameron come out ahead in U.K. kerfuffle? • But the caucuses were really something","1857","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/07/uncovered-audio-hillary-was-adamantly-against-illegal-immigrants.html"
"UNCOVERED AUDIO: HILLARY WAS ‘ADAMANTLY AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS’ The RNC today is shelling presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in her bunker with newly uncovered audio from a 2003 radio interview she gave as a senator. Apparently asked about the issue of illegal immigration, which was a hot button in the state at the time, Clinton swung hard: “I am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigrants.” Clinton, on the campaign trail in Nevada Wednesday, promised to push for citizenship for those in the country illegally. She also vowed to go beyond President Obama’s executive amnesty for an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants if Republicans do not acquiesce. Obama’s order has so far been blocked by federal courts. In the audio from the RNC of what the committee says is Clinton’s interview with radio host John Gambling, Clinton calls for more border security and for employers to stop hiring illegal immigrants. “Come up to Westchester, go to Suffolk and Nassau counties, stand in the street corners in Brooklyn or the Bronx,” she is heard to complain “You’re going to see loads of people waiting to get picked up to go do yard work and construction work and domestic work.” CLINTONS GET CREATIVE ON CAMPAIGN CASH: IF DISCLOSURE ‘LOOKS BAD,’ DON’T DISCLOSE If you thought that Hillary Clinton would be more bashful about buckraking given the current scandals surrounding her family finances and those of its foundation, you haven’t been paying attention. Clinton is vacuuming up money in California this week, but behind the scenes her campaign is busy blurring lines on campaign cash. First, Clinton will do what Democrats once reviled and raise cash for her super PAC. President Obama endorsed his super PAC, but stopped short of plumping for checks. (Candidates can’t legally make the ask, but they can probably stand next to the guy with his hand out – wink-wink, nudge-nudge – and swear up and down that they are not coordinating their efforts.) Second, Clinton is so far not disclosing the identities of the bundlers, the mostly wealthy partisans who collect checks from their friends for campaigns. You know – bundlers. Releasing the names is not a legal requirement, but it has been standard practice for presidential candidates of both parties. You’d think Clinton would want to be more forthcoming about where her money comes from these days. But as her husband said​, “Any kind of disclosure is a target” that it “looks bad.” So the answer to the lengthening list of questions for the candidate and her campaign is less disclosure and more blurry fundraising lines. Who made varsity this season? - A memo obtained by Bloomberg gives all the names of Clinton’s campaign A-team this time around. Not a lot of familiar faces, signaling a desire for change in this election cycle. No pictures allowed, Clinton Foundation guests gather in Morocco - ABC News: “When ABC News producers attempted to take pictures of guests arriving at the front entrance, Moroccan police threatened their arrest. The foundation’s spokesman initially professed not to know where the reception was being held, and the location was among the only not included on schedules handed out to the media and published online.” Hillary personal email use ‘not acceptable’ says State Dept. - The Hill: ""Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email account run through a private server was 'not acceptable' and happened without officials’ knowledge, a top State Department record-keeper said on Wednesday. 'I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable,' Joyce Barr, the State Department’s assistant secretary for the Bureau of Administration, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee."" TRADE ROILS BOTH PARTIES AS AIR OBAMA HEADS TO NIKE As he laces up to tout his trade deal at Nike’s Oregon headquarters – an intriguing choice given the company’s sweat-shop past – President Obama’s push for fast track authority is proving to be far from a slam dunk in Congress. Indeed, with Obama pressing reluctant Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker John Boehner are trying put a buzzer beater. But opposition to the deal is stiff on both sides of the aisle and the pact is no more popular with Sixteeners of both stripes. Breaking with GOP frontrunners who support the deal, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee trash-talked the trade pact, warning that American workers could “take it up the backside” under the current proposal. “Fast-track means nobody’s paying attention,” Huckabee said. Among Democrats, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Gov. Martin O’Malley are strongly opposed. And where is Hillary Clinton in all this? On the bench, where she says she’s “watching closely.” Bernie heckles - “Nike epitomizes why disastrous unfettered free-trade policies during the past four decades have failed American workers, eroded our manufacturing base and increased income and wealth inequality in this country,” Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., penned in a letter to the president Tuesday. “Just don’t do it,” Sanders wrote. Why Nike? - National Journal takes a detailed look at the apparel giant, which is headquartered in the U.S. but does most of its business overseas: “Nike made $12.4 billion in profits last year, thanks in large part to 1 million subcontracted workers at factories primarily in low-wage countries in Asia. For years, the company has faced allegations that a number of those factories use sweatshop conditions and illegally low wages to produce sneakers and clothes that Nike then sells in much wealthier countries.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… One of the most famous photographs in sports journalism is of the 1965 game between rival schools Deerfield Academy and Mount Hermon in which the game went on before full stands as a huge fire consumed Mount Hermon’s science building right behind the bleachers. Would you like to know the story behind the famous photo? NYT has the details: “Halftime came. Officials conferred about how to handle the nettlesome situation. In a decision that surely would not be made in today’s safety-conscious, litigious world, they decided it would be better if the teams just carried on. ‘We were told to suck it up and play,’ [one Mount Hermon player] recalled.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

THE WHALE IS GETTING READY TO SURFACE As three more fish joined the growing school of Republican presidential candidates this week, the whale in the race, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has be staying far below the surface. Bush has been quiet lately, with no public events and an under the radar op-ed in the Chicago Tribune. Some advisers told the WaPo not to expect an announcement for at least a month. But others have told Fox News First that the official announcement will be sooner than that and done in a low key manner – as might befit a candidate with 99 percent name recognition among Republican voters. (While a candidate like Scott Walker, still unknown to 1 in 5 Republicans in the latest WSJ/NBC News poll needs a lift from his eventual launch, Bush will be risk-averse.) So when does the whale of a candidate come to the surface? Perhaps his speech at Liberty University’s commencement this Saturday will be just that spray. How Jeb sank Christie - National Journal: “From the time a Bush candidacy started looking more likely, the wind came out of [New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s] presidential sails to the point when he was effectively dead in the water. It was mostly because Bush filled a void that Christie planned to fill in himself. The bridge mess was just icing on the cake.” [Gov. Christie starts another two-day tour through New Hampshire today.] Rubio snags top-drawer Nevada state director - Las Vegas Review-Journal: “U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio on Wednesday gained a strong ally when Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison announced would be the Florida senator’s presidential campaign director in Nevada…[Hutchinson] noted Rubio’s family ties to the Silver State, having lived in Las Vegas for six months while growing up. His father was a bartender and his mother a maid.” Paul pays up for his own name - National Journal: “Days before [Rand Paul] launched his bid for president, his campaign shelled out more than $100,000 to a domain-buying firm to purchase a ‘domain name.’ Soon after, RandPaul.com, which had previously been a pro-Paul site run by his fans, emerged as the official portal for the campaign. Federal campaign records show Paul used his Senate reelection committee to pay $100,980 to Escrow.com, a domain service, on March 27.” Carson meets with community leaders in Baltimore - Baltimore Sun: “Dr. Ben Carson, the former Hopkins neurosurgeon who announced his candidacy for president this week, will visit with Baltimore faith and community leaders on Thursday...A spokeswoman did not respond to a request to clarify if Carson's visit is related to the Freddie Gray case. Carson is also set to speak to at a Maryland Right to Life banquet later Thursday evening in Woodlawn.” “And we have to re-instill that can-do attitude that is so important in our nation. It's what drove this nation from no place to the pinnacle of the world, and the highest pinnacle anybody else had ever reached. And it doesn't have anything to do with one's ethnicity. It has to do with the American spirit.” – Ben Carson on “The Kelly File.” Huckabee strategy: Focus south and skip New Hampshire - Union Leader: “That Huckabee question looms large as the GOP field expands and the former Arkansas governor is reported to be concentrating on the first caucuses in Iowa and the southern primaries in the weeks after New Hampshire’s leadoff contest…Huckabee received 26,916 votes in the New Hampshire primary in 2008. Chuck Norris is again on the Huckabee bandwagon. How many of his old friends in the Granite State will say the same?” As he cuts a deal with a former rival - The ad man famous for producing the “Willie Horton” ad in 1988, and working with Gov. Mitt Romney, R-Ma., in 2007 will host a Huckabee fundraiser in Phoenix on May 14, political strategist and producer Floyd Brown confirms to Bloomberg. [Day two of Huckabee’s “Factories, Farms and Freedom” tour includes meet & greets at Charlie’s American Grill in Sioux City and the Pizza Ranch in Cedar Rapids.] Perry defends tuition for illegal immigrants - Dallas Morning News: “[Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry] then had another chance to explain his support of the so-called Dream Act after a speech that focused on foreign policy. In answering a query from Jorge Baldor, founder of the Latino Center for Leadership Development, Perry said it made sense to educate children brought to the state illegally, but ‘through no fault of their own’…‘The fact is you’re either going to have givers or takers,’ Perry said, ‘If you’re not going to educate, and allow these kids to go through that process and become a giver, because they’ve been educated, then I would suggest you’ve been focused on the wrong issue.’” Santorum announces he’s announcing – Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., announced to Greta Van Susteren last night that he will announce his 2016 plans in his home state on May 27. Watch the clip here. Fiorina rollout rolls on - Carly Fiorina gives a speech at a Dallas County GOP event in West Des Moines, Iowa and hosts a few meet and greets today. Snyder not running? – Despite murmurings of a potential run two sources tell Politico Gov. Rick Snyder, R-Mich., is not running. A Snyder spokesperson declined to comment. Campaign cinema - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has a new campaign video out today that highlights his vision of a new America with a New Hampshire backdrop. Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, also uses New Hampshire to show his connections with voters. Gov. Mike Huckabee’s video focuses on commitment to family and faith. CHANGES TO THE IOWA STRAW POLL LOOK GOOD FOR CANDIDATES The traditional Iowa straw poll will be a little different this time around with a lot less pressure on the candidates. The event hosts are taking a lot of the cost for real estate and food on themselves, but candidates now need to be nationally viable candidates that are part of the discussion. Check out this op-ed for all the details. THE JUDGE’S RULING: DEFLATE THE PATRIOT ACT With the Patriot Act up for renewal on May 31 Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano analyzes the constitutional complications of the law and a growing movement called ‘Restore the Fourth,’ that advocates ending the Patriot Act under the Fourth Amendment. President Obama and Republicans agree on the renewal, but should they? Read here for the judge’s take. CAN CAMERON COME OUT AHEAD IN U.K. KERFUFFLE? Voting is in full swing in Britain and polls won’t close until 5 p.m. ET. What will happen? No one seems to know except that result will be messy as either of the two major parties are likely to need the help of at least one smaller group – liberals, Scottish separatists, anti-European Unionists, etc. – to build a majority coalition. Lacking an executive branch, Britain’s system gives control of the entire government to the party which wins a vote equivalent to the vote for speaker of the House of Representatives in the U.S. With polls showing neither the Labour nor Conservative parties likely able to win the 326 seats necessary to win an outright majority, control of the government for America’s most important ally will hinge on deal making with the niche parties. Can Prime Minister David Cameron and his Tories cling to power? Will Scots have their revenge by helping Ed Miliband and Labour topple the current ruling coalition? It is quite likely to be a mess. Lucky for you then that SkyNews will have all of the details. Bibi survives with last-minute deal - AP: “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday completed the formation of a new coalition government, reaching a last-minute deal with a nationalist party just before a midnight deadline. The late-night deal saved Netanyahu from the unthinkable scenario of being forced from office. But it set the stage for the formation of a narrow coalition dominated by hard-line and religious parties that appears to be on a collision course with the U.S. and other allies.” BIG NAMES LINE UP FOR MEMORIAL DAY PARADE The list of participants and entertainers for the May 25 National Memorial Day Parade on the National Mall is out this morning: Actors Gary Sinise and Joe Mantegna; television chef Robert Irvine; musicians Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins, Caleb Johnson from American Idol and country singer Beau Davidson; Miss America 2015 Kira Kazantsev, TNA Wrestling stars including Army vet Chris Melendez; and martial music and displays from the Marine Corps Equestrian Color Guard, the U.S. Army Band and marching platoons from all service branches.

BUT THE CAUCUSES WERE REALLY SOMETHING Reuters: “The Australian Sex Party, a tiny party known for its salacious name and election day antics, said on Thursday that it had been deregistered after the country’s election watchdog ruled it did not have enough activists. Co-founder Robbie Swan said in a statement that the party would ‘vigorously’ appeal a decision handed down by the Australian Election Commission (AEC) that removed its official status following a review of its membership. Under Australian law a political party must have either an elected representative in the federal parliament or 500 members to keep its registration. The Sex Party has one lawmaker in the Victoria state legislature, but none at federal level.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “[President Bill Clinton] said there was a guy who said he put the information in the wrong box, and now he says we have no idea how this information was left out. It’s sort of amusing. It reminds you of what they said about a lot of other stuff they lied about consistently in the ‘90s. And this is just a guarantee that if we elect Hillary, we’re going to get this for another eight years.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"Buzz Cut: • Dislike for Hillary intensifies • Biden gets personal with party officials about run • Trump’s new Iowa hire busted trashing him • Kasich PAC pumps up N.H. ad blitz • If you can’t trust gas station parking lot sausage…","1861","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/27/dislike-for-hillary-intensifies.html"
"DISLIKE FOR HILLARY INTENSIFIES Hillary Clinton’s lead in the Democratic nominating contest keeps on sliding and a new poll today from Quinnipiac University shows the trend is intensifying. Clinton’s lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is down 15 points from last month. While she might not have to worry too much about Sanders given her 23-point advantage, her 10 point slip from July seems largely attributable to increasing interest in Vice President Joe Biden, who is mulling a campaign. The best selling point for Biden backers: Clinton runs considerably worse in head-to-head matchups with potential Republican opponents than Biden. She runs 4 points ahead of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, while Biden doubles that. Even socialist Sanders beats Jeb Bush by more than Clinton. And surely by now you know the reason why. Views of Clinton have turned intensely sour in recent weeks as her ongoing email scandal has left her and her campaign in a defensive crouch. Clinton’s net favorability rating among all voters – a more valuable general election metric in the early going than horse-race numbers – is now a dreadful negative 12 points. That puts her in the same neighborhood as Rick Santorum and Martin O’Malley. Probably not the company she expected to be keeping just now. Clinton’s numbers have come to look a lot like those of her GOP counterpart, Trump. They are the best known candidates, with 92 percent of voters having formed opinions about each of them, and those opinions are not good. Fifty-four percent of voters think ill of Trump, compared to 51 percent for Clinton. Clinton’s advantage over Trump is that she faces much less resistance in her own party. Three quarters of Democrats have favorable views of Clinton – 10 points less than Biden, but still sturdy. Trump, on the other hand, is seen negatively by nearly a third of GOP voters. Only 11 percent of Democrats said they would “definitely not” back Clinton compared to 26 for Trump with the GOP. Third-place GOP candidate Bush can be happy that a quarter of his party is keeping an open mind, but the grim news is that more than twice as many respondents would never consider supporting him (18 percent) than are currently backing his candidacy (7 percent). Only 9 percent of GOP respondents are waiting to hear more about Trump before making up their minds. The poll shows continued good news for Ben Carson. He’s pulled into second place behind Trump in the race for the GOP nomination and he has the best overall favorability score of any candidate in the race. The best liked candidate among GOP primary voters, though, is Marco Rubio, viewed favorably by 72 percent of his fellow Republicans. Carson is second in the GOP with 62 percent favorability. Message: ‘I get it’ - WSJ: “Appearing before cameras after a speech in Iowa, she said she understands the concerns. “I know people have raised questions about my email use as secretary of state, and I understand why. I get it,” she said Wednesday. She went on to give a familiar explanation: her arrangement was legally permissible at the time, she’s turned over 55,000 pages of email, she has given her computer server to authorities investigating the matter and has plans to testify before a congressional committee.” [Clinton holds a campaign event in Cleveland before holding a fundraiser in the tony suburb of Bratenahl.] Biden gets personal with party officials about run - NPR: “Confirming rumors that he is seriously considering jumping into the 2016 presidential race, Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged that he is indeed weighing whether to get into the contest. But in a closed-conference call with Democratic National Committee officials, he noted that he and his family are trying to decide ‘whether or not there is the emotional fuel at this time to run.’ Biden's son Beau died of brain cancer in May. ‘If I were to announce to run,’ Biden said, ‘I have to be able to commit to all of you that I would be able to give it my whole heart and my whole soul, and right now, both are pretty well banged up. ... I've given this a lot of thought and dealing internally with the family on how we do this.’” [Donors ready to deploy - The Hill: “…A number of big donors with ties to Biden have not thrown their support to the Democratic frontrunner.”] Ouch: Hillary backer Harkin says she might give Biden a job if he doesn’t run - Former Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said that Biden shouldn’t make the leap, even suggesting that he could find work in Clinton’s administration, albeit in a diminished role: “With Hillary as president, I can see him being secretary of state or ambassador to the United Nations,” Harkin said. The Judge’s Ruling: Sweater weather - From failed operations in Libya and Syria to unsecured email on her private server, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano asks whether Hillary Clinton has been pulling the wool over our eyes for years. “What if Clinton just doesn’t care whether she has broken any federal laws, illegally caused the deaths of thousands of innocents, and profoundly jeopardized and misled the American people? What if the American people do care about all this? What will they do about it?” Read here. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Every year at the Autumnal Equinox on Easter Island, chiefs of the native Rapu Nui tribe had a contest to see who could collect the first-laid egg on a nearby islet. The various clans within the tribe would gather at the same spot to select their representative. Contestants had to scale down a cliff and swim through rough surf and shark-infested waters in order to reach the islet. When the first person found the egg he had to bring it back intact. Why? Rough Guides explains: “The new birdman would first have all the hair shaved off his head; he would then live in strict seclusion for a whole year in a sacred house at the foot of Rano Raraku, eating only certain foods, and forbidden to bathe or cut his nails. His kin-group, meanwhile, was endowed with a special, high status, which was often taken as an excuse for members to dominate and bully their rival groups.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Trump’s top hire in Iowa got busted in emails leaked to the Des Moines Register trashing his now-boss. In messages written as recently as last month, new Trump national co-chairman, Sam Clovis, who abandoned the struggling campaign of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry this week to work for Trump, calls the New York billionaire “a cancer on conservatism” and a man with “no foundation in Christ.” Clovis said in one message that as a veteran he was “offended by a man who sought and gained four student deferments to avoid the draft and who has never served this nation a day — not a day — in any fashion or way.” Clovis copped to the nastygrams, but said he had become convinced of Trump’s merits and sincerity after he got the chance to “look [Trump] in the eye and ask him the tough questions.” Meanwhile... Huckabee scores top Iowa staffers - Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is making a move in the Hawkeye State with the announcement that Aaron Trost will serve as Iowa state director. A mid-westerner, Trost was campaign manager for Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., who defeated former Sen. Bob Kerry, D-Neb, in 2012 after her come from behind victory in the GOP primary. “We are following the same playbook that led us to victory in the 2008 Iowa caucuses,” says campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart. “Bringing Aaron on the team, with his Midwestern prowess, will allow us to build on our grassroots organization and win.” Huckabee, who is polling in the middle of the pack both nationally and in RCP’s average of Iowa polls, is also bringing on Terry Amann as state co-chairman. Amann is an influential central Iowa pastor who is on Republican 2016ers’ most wanted endorsement list. [Huckabee has three “Huck stops Here” events in northwestern Iowa before he attends Sen. Chuck Grassley’s GOP summer picnic, in Okoboji.] Trump ramps up populist pitch with call for high-end tax hike - Bloomberg:“Republican front-runner Donald Trump began to flesh out his economic vision for America, and it includes raising taxes on the wealthy. Trump said during a Wednesday interview on Bloomberg’s With All Due Respect that he would like to change the tax code. ‘I would change it. I would simplify it,’ Trump [said]. … ‘I would take carried interest out, and I would let people making hundreds of millions of dollars-a-year pay some tax, because right now they are paying very little tax and I think it's outrageous,’ Trump said. ‘I want to lower taxes for the middle class.’ Asked whether his proposed changes meant he was prepared to raise taxes on himself, the billionaire framed his answer in terms of fairness. ‘That’s right. That’s right. I’m OK with it. You’ve seen my statements, I do very well, I don't mind paying some taxes.’” [Trump holds a rally in Greenville, S.C. today.] Stay classy - What if the other candidates tweeted like Trump? Free Beacon ponders the possibilities. Walker stands by China tough talk - AP: “GOP presidential candidate Scott Walker renewed his call Wednesday for President Barack Obama to cancel an official state visit with the president of China, saying the move would not hurt trade with states like Iowa, where he was spending the day campaigning, or Wisconsin, where he is governor…Walker defended the call on Wednesday when asked about possible negative repercussions for agricultural states like Iowa and Wisconsin that do billions of dollars of trade with Beijing. Walker said Obama shouldn’t be offering a state visit to the leader of a country behind cyber attacks in the United States.” Rubio holds steady in N.H. - WMUR: “While [Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.] can’t boast of crowds or poll numbers like front-runner Donald Trump, he continues to draw solid crowds and generate positive buzz as he meets voters. In Londonderry, some Republicans waited close to half an hour to shake hands and take a picture with Rubio.” [Rubio holds a town hall at the University of South Carolina in Columbia today as well as a meet and greet.] Kasich PAC pumps up N.H. ad blitz - Saying the more Granite State voters hear about him, the more they like him, the super PAC backing Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Day for America, announced another big ad outlay. “New Hampshire ad buy has been extended through September 17th with another million dollars. Over the last two months, $5 million has been spent in NH.”, the group said in a statement to Fox News. The announcement accompanies release of a new ad that ad highlights Kasich’s budget hawkishness. Rand’s campaign says he’s ‘in it for the long haul’ - Roll Call: “As Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and his presidential campaign embarked this week on a western swing – working their way from Alaska to Utah – they hoped to send a message to his fellow Republican candidates — that Paul is ‘in it for the long haul.’” IF YOU CAN’T TRUST GAS STATION PARKING LOT SAUSAGE… KHOU: “A San Antonio woman was arrested Monday, accused of stealing thousands of dollars worth of sausage from her job. Kimberly Carrillo, 28, was arrested after a fellow employee told police they witnessed her selling the links at a nearby gas station. Carrillo is now facing theft charges for stealing nearly $3,000 worth of sausage from the Kiolbassa Provision Company. According to Carrillo's arrest warrant, she was an employee at the company, but when her boss was made aware of the theft, she was fired. Police said there is also surveillance footage both of Carrillo taking the sausage from Kiolbassa, and selling it at the gas station.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"THE DONALD UNDONE? Apologize? Drop out of the race? Hardly. Donald Trump’s answers to a deluge of criticism from Republican rivals and the national party over his attack on Sen. John McCain’s standing as a war hero and the Arizona Senator’s record on veterans: “They’re very upset that I’m leading the polls,” and by the way, “the news media are also distorting my words.” In the latest round of barbs, Trump doubled down on his criticism of McCain’s record in a USAT OpEd, and balked at competitors scorn saying, “I do not need to be lectured by any of them.” [He knows best - NYT: “[His] improvised fit of pique…exposed the biggest vulnerability of Mr. Trump’s campaign for president: It is built entirely around the instincts and grievances of its unpredictable candidate — and does not rely on a conventional political operation that protects presidential hopefuls from themselves.”] The past 48 hours have seen a number of reports that Trump’s comments have passed a tipping point. Others have surfaced questioning the billionaire’s service deferments during the Vietnam war. But the fact remains he continues to draw oxygen from a crowded GOP field, particularly the likes of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Carly Fiorina. With the first debate just 17 days away and another candidate about to join the group that oxygen is becoming precious, especially for those on the debate stage bubble. So far, name recognition and strong poll numbers have enabled Trump to throw his verbal grenades and to an extent channel them into issues that find some resonance in the party. Whether he can do the same with his latest blast, or if he has dropped this one too close to his feet remains to be seen. The rapid Republican backlash may point to the beginning of the end of a Trump pageantry. The Donald’s response clearly shows he thinks he has by no means reached his undoing. [Asked on MSNBC’s Morning Joe if Trump owes him an apology, McCain responded: “No, I don’t think so. But I think he may owe an apology to the families of those who have sacrificed in conflict and those who have undergone the prison experience in serving their country.”]","1882","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/donald-undone.html"
"But that wasn’t the worst of it - Wash Ex’s Byron York says that bashing McCain wasn’t Trump’s worst mistake in Iowa this weekend. He writes, “Instead, Trump’s casual and disengaged characterization of religious faith may have made a far worse impression on the mostly evangelical conservatives who came to hear Trump and other Republican hopefuls speak.” JEB TAKES ON ‘MOUNT WASHINGTON’ In a variation on theme he used as Florida’s governor to rein in spending, Jeb Bush outlines his presidential priorities in a speech today from the state’s capitol. From excerpts: “We used to call this city ‘Mount Tallahassee’ because it was so remote from the people, so caught up in the settled ways of a comfortable establishment….Should I win this election, you will not find me deferring to the settled ways of ‘Mount Washington,’ either. The overspending, the overreaching, the arrogance, and the sheer incompetence in that city – these problems have been with us so long that they are sometimes accepted as facts of life. But a president should never accept them, and I will not. We need a president willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation’s capital –and I mean to do it!”","1883","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/donald-undone.html"

Scott Walker, R-Wisc.] was confronted by a family of an undocumented worker in his childhood hometown of Plainfield, Iowa during one of the final stops of his whirlwind presidential campaign launch tour on Sunday. Jose Flores, an undocumented immigrant who calls Wisconsin home, was accompanied by his 13-year-old daughter Leslie and 7-year-old son Luis, both of whom were born in the United States and naturalized citizens…Shaking Flores’ hand, Walker said he ‘completely sympathize[s] with the situation you’re all in and others are in’ but… ‘The fact is, we’re a nation of laws,” Walker said. “And unfortunately, the president last year, after saying 22 times before last year that he couldn’t make the law himself, he said he wasn’t the emperor…he decided to change the law even though the courts announced that you can’t do that.’” Set to sign abortion bill - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker is scheduled Monday to sign a bill banning abortions at or beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy.

"WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… With the revolutionary images of Pluto capturing the nation’s attention last week it seems only fitting to remember the first major planetary achievement: man on the moon.

The next day, at 1:46 p.m., the lunar module Eagle, manned by Armstrong and [Edwin Aldrin Jr.,] separated from the command module, where [Michael Collins] remained…and at 4:18 p.m. the craft touched down on the southwestern edge of the Sea of Tranquility…","1890","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/donald-undone.html"

At 10:56 p.m., Armstrong spoke his famous quote, which he later contended was slightly garbled by his microphone and meant to be “that’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” He then planted his left foot on the gray, powdery surface, took a cautious step forward, and humanity had walked on the moon.”","1891","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/20/donald-undone.html"

"Got diversity? The 2016 GOP presidential field sure does, and Republicans are eager to show it off. In fact, these days the party is so quick to flaunt its colors that it should change its mascot from the elephant to the peacock.","Published May 27, 2015","1915","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"Not long ago, Conservatives would sneer at the value of diversity. They shrugged off criticism that they needed a more diverse following. They dismissed the idea that women governed differently than men, or that minorities approached racial and cultural issues with more sensitivity than whites.","1916","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"In fact, the GOP has often seemed to go out of its way to antagonize women and minorities. In recent years, Republicans have led crackdowns on immigration, welfare, affirmative action, abortion rights, and race-based scholarships.","1917","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"Today, it’s a whole new multi-cultural ballgame. The Republican candidates who have entered the race include two Cuban-Americans (Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida), an African-American (Dr. Ben Carson), and a woman (Carly Fiorina). Also expected to jump in are Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is Indian-American, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose wife, Columba, was born in Mexico. Bush speaks Spanish so well that, earlier this month, he confidently recorded a pitch-perfect message for Cinco de Mayo.","1918","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has reached out to African-Americans and said Republicans must address their concerns lest “people experience a daily ugliness that dashes hope and leaves only the fatigue of despair.”","1919","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"It’s a dramatic change from where the party was several years ago, and conservative radio hosts aren’t shy about pointing that out. Some of the same folks who didn’t see any value in diversity now consider it a major asset.","1920","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"It doesn’t hurt that the likely Democratic nominee is Hillary Clinton, a white woman who will be 69-years-old on election day. Republicans are eager to draw a contrast between Clinton and a fresher, more ethnic face — like Rubio or Jindal.","1921","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"What’s the value of a diverse field of candidates? First, it advances the argument that the GOP is the real party of opportunity, and blunts Democratic attempts to portray the Republican Party as an exclusive country club for white males. Second, it might also help broaden the party’s appeal to “non-traditional” voters who would never think of voting for a Republican. And third, the pressure is on Clinton, or whoever turns out to be the Democratic nominee, to put together a more substantive outreach effort to keep minorities in the fold. When it comes to diversity, conservatives often play defense. But with a diverse array of candidates, like the one taking shape for 2016, the party can go on offense.","1922","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"But there’s a catch. The GOP is divided.","1923","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"There is the wing that understands changing demographics and insisted that, with whites expected to become a statistical minority in the United States by 2043, it’s foolish for Republicans to rely only on the support of white voters and not actively reach out to African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Latinos. The thinking goes that the best way to do that is with a diverse group of candidates.","1924","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"Yet there are also traditionalists who believe in being loyal to core voters, and avoiding dramatic changes. This wing sneers at identity politics. It welcomes the support of women and minorities, but only if those voters find their way to the party on their own — not because the party courted them. Finally, it believes that Republicans can win elections if it just turns out the party’s conservative base.","1925","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"These philosophies are often in conflict. Yes, Republicans have a diverse assortment of presidential candidates.","1926","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"But there are still Republicans like Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin who go on conservative talk radio and come out against legal immigration -- a message that won't help lure more ethnic minorities into the GOP tent. And former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who accused Democrats of making women “believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control, because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government.”","1927","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"Interestingly, there are even Republicans who seem to “get it” one minute and then get in trouble the next. It’s as if they can’t help themselves, as they revert back to the tone-deafness for which the Republican Party has become so well known.","1928","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"Take Rand Paul, who illustrates both the solution and the problem. One minute he is talking about reaching out to African-Americans. The next, he is responding to the Baltimore riots by joking that he was on a train through the city once and he’s glad it didn’t stop. Worse, Paul went where no white candidate should go — lecturing the black community on “the breakdown of the family structure, the lack of fathers, the lack of sort of a moral code in our society.” That was not helpful.","1929","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"
"As some Republicans try to move the party forward, others will try to hold it back. It’s a brutal tug-of-war with high stakes. Let’s hope the forward-looking group wins.","1930","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/27/in-2016-race-its-gop-thats-diverse-and-thats-good-thing.html"

"OBAMA POISED TO PLAY KINGMAKER IN JOE-HILLARY DUEL When White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told Brother Bill Hemmer earlier this month that “the president certainly believes that a spirited contest would be in the best interests of our party, and in the best interest of our country” it was seen as a tacit encouragement to Vice President Joe Biden. But the lines this week sound almost like a solicitation: “I think you could make the case that there is probably no one in American politics today who has a better understanding of exactly what is required to mount a successful national presidential campaign.” Whoa, dude. With Jeff Zeleny reporting that President Obama has “given his blessing” for a Biden run, the crazy summer is poised to get crazier still. What Obama does with his network and his endorsement remains an open question. But the seeming effort to goad Hillary Clinton by praising Biden as she reaches lower and lower ebbs in her struggling campaign looks like, at the very least, a passive-aggressive swipe against an old rival. If the president is true to his word and stays neutral in such a fight it sets him up as the most powerful man in the party, yet again. Remember, the sooner Clinton has the nomination locked up, the sooner Obama becomes a doubly lame duck. But if he can have two candidates auditioning for his support, staying on his left side and, most importantly, not distancing themselves from him it adds new relevancy to an increasingly marginal administration. That’s all upside, even if Hillary wins. If Biden wins, it’s not just a third Obama term in the rhetorical sense. It’s the real thing. We’ve read about his late-night dinner parties pondering his post-election life among the rich and famous. But maybe he aims to play an unlikely kingmaker on his way out the door. Biden could take the heat off Obama - “Biden getting in would be the best gift to President Obama and his legacy, because that would mean that he … wouldn’t have to defend Hillary Clinton every week. They could say, ‘You know what? We’re staying out of this. You can call the FBI. Call the campaign. Call Biden. Call Hillary Clinton. We’re focused on the president being the president of the United States.” – Noted smart person Dana Perino on “The Five.” Patriarchy, man - WSJ: “[Vice President Joe Biden] is now leaning more toward running than he was earlier in the summer, though he is still weeks from a decision…But following the loss of Beau Biden in May, the elder Biden is concerned about whether his relatives could handle a bid for the presidency and its time demands on the family patriarch. Advisers know that only the vice president can make the judgment about the readiness of his family.” Firewall: Hillary cuts deal with state parties - NYT: “Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign has gotten commitments from four Democratic state parties, including the one in crucial proving ground of New Hampshire, to enter into joint fundraising agreements to begin raising money now, while the nominating battle is underway. … In addition to New Hampshire, the three other state parties that have already signed agreements with the Clinton campaign are in Virginia, Mississippi and Wisconsin, according to two people briefed on the issue, who weren’t authorized to speak publicly. …. But others expressed reservations about the appearances – and realities – of engaging in such a practice before the party selects a nominee.” PORTMAN PULLS AHEAD, TOOMEY THUMPS, FLORIDA A JUMP BALL After trailing former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland by 6 points in a June poll from Quinnipiac University, Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman is up 3 points this month in his re-election bid. Quinnipiac also surveyed the Senate races in Pennsylvania and Florida. In Pennsylvania, Democratic frontrunner Joe Sestak saw his deficit in the race to unseat Republican incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey nearly double to now stand at 15 points. In Florida’s chaotic contest, with relatively little-known candidates in both parties scrambling for the chance to vie for the seat Sen. Marco Rubio is vacating, it is anyone’s guess. Only one candidate, Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., could muster name identification above 30 percent and voter sentiment toward him was negative by a margin of more than two-to-one. Get full results here. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… It is true that we are all held together by an invisible thread…well, not a thread exactly, but a force called “dark matter.” Once thought to be a crazy theory, Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky, argued the universe was made of something other than atoms, the latest theory in the early-1930s. But Zwicky’s research led him to believe that something out there had to have strong enough gravitational pull to hold all of the universe’s matter together aside from atoms. He called this “dark matter.” The theory was forgotten until the 1970s when astronomers looked at it again after discovering that other galaxies were not spinning the right way. The BBC took a look at dark matter and how its discovery and enduring mysteries shaped our understanding of the universe. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

At this point in the campaign, less than half have formed an opinion of any Republican candidate except Donald Trump and Jeb Bush. Partly because of this, Hispanics’ views of most GOP candidates range from mildly positive to mildly negative. The sole exception is Trump, whose favorable rating with Hispanics is deeply negative. Gallup began tracking the images of all the major announced candidates for president nightly in early July. Since then, 14% of the roughly 650 Hispanics interviewed have said they view Trump favorably, while 65% have viewed him unfavorably, yielding a net favorable score of -51.” Oh, baby - Texas Tribune: “Speaking with reporters inside a Mexican restaurant, Bush grew visibly irritated when pressed about the term ‘anchor babies’…He clarified — in English and Spanish — that his original use of the phrase had more to do with ‘organized efforts taking advantage’ of birthright citizenship, not necessarily by Latinos seeking to live in the United States. ‘Frankly, it's more related to Asian people coming into our country,’ Bush said, instantly setting off another round of Democratic outrage.” [Whoa… - Daily Caller: “While it is difficult to get exact numbers on the amount of Chinese coming to deliver birth in the US, it is estimated there were 60,000 of these Chinese anchor babies in 2014.”] Jeb’s gets vets - Fox News’ Serafin Gomez reports that Jeb Bush is set to receive the endorsements of 75 military veterans. The announcement will be the highlight of Bush’s event today in Colorado and, “The endorsements constitute the largest group of military veteran supporters for any candidate in the 2016 election, according to the Bush campaign.” Walker says Obama should cancel Chinese president’s visit - Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., said that President Obama should cancel Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Washington next month. Walker said in a statement, “Rather than honoring Chinese President Xi Jinping with an official state visit next month, President Obama should focus on holding China accountable over its increasing attempts to undermine U.S. interests.” [A top Walker donor, Anthony Scaramucci, met with Donald Trump Monday over Trump’s comments bashing hedge funds, reports WSJ. Scaramucci, the head of SkyBridge Capital, says he’s loyal to Walker and the meeting was only to get Trump to back off.] Carson takes on #BlackLivesMatter - Discussing his USA Today op-ed, Ben Carson talks about the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Talking to Fox News’ Megyn Kelly Carson says, “I’ve had many black Democrats come up to me recently and say, you make so much sense. I’m a Democrat but I’m voting for you…Myself and a number of my Republican colleagues are very interested in putting together mechanisms that allow people to climb out of dependency and to become strong parts of the fabric of America.” Watch here. Kasich’s tricky Wall Street balancing act - With buzzing about Wall Street hitting 2016 the NYT takes a look at John Kasich’s image strategy. Kasich’s touts his father and grandfather’s working-class background, but the former Lehman Brothers investment banker doesn’t exactly have the same story. Kasich claims he embraces all facets of his background, and isn’t afraid to discuss his lucrative ventures, but what about when rival campaigns start discussing it for him? [Lotts of support - Columbus Dispatch: “Longtime U.S. Senate leader Trent Lott of Mississippi is endorsing Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president.] Cruz feels the love in S.C. - WashEx’s Byron York went to Rep. Jeff Duncan’s BBQ in Anderson, S.C. where conservative favorites Ben Carson, Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz all showed to stand pork shoulder to pork shoulder. All were warmly received, but York says Cruz was the clear favorite. [Cruz headlines the Tuscaloosa County Lincoln-Reagan dinner in Alabama.] PERILOUS PERRY August has not been kind to Rick Perry. The former Texas governor’s cash poor campaign, which two weeks ago announced it could not pay staffers, took a severe hit as Perry’s Iowa chairman, prominent conservative and talk radio host Sam Clovis, announced he was abandoning Perry. Trying to brighten darkening clouds, Perry campaign spokesperson Lucy Nashed told Fox News the campaign has started putting some people in Iowa and South Carolina back on the payroll. But lackluster fundraising and low polling numbers have left Perry stuck in the basement – hardly inspirational for new donors. Clovis is reportedly entertaining offers from rival campaigns. [The Daily Beast looks at how the PACs backing Perry are keeping the campaign on life support.] SOUND OFF: READERS REACT TO 2016 GOP POWER INDEX “The fact of the matter is that Trump is far, far ahead of your personal favorite (Jeb) and Jeb is the furthest back of the top 10…and you keep putting him first in your power index. Your little cute game of trying to influence people to vote for Jeb because he’s #1 in your poll will not work.” – Rebecca Walker “I would nominate Donald Trump today - even though there are others I really like, for instance Marco Rubio, I feel Donald Trump has the ability to be tough and lead the country in this day of many crises.” – Yolanda Peterson “From someone looking to win in 2016, I support a Bush (FL)-Kasich (OH) ticket. Two governors with strong records of achievement in two strategic states; strong organization and fund raising; and who would appeal across the political spectrum to not only Republicans, but to independents and conservative Democrats.” – Mike Walsh “I am quite pleased to see Senator Ted Cruz eek his way up to the #2 position and #1 among true Conservatives… I think that Cruz may be one of the only candidates that Donald Trump would be pleased…which would head off a third party candidacy.” – Mark Lenox TRIPPIN’ AND RIPPIN’ The Guardian: “A 12-year-old Taiwanese boy lived out a slapstick nightmare at the weekend when he tripped at a museum and broke his fall with a painting, smashing a hole in it. Exhibition organisers said the painting was a 350-year-old Paolo Porpora oil on canvas work called Flowers, valued at $1.5m. Footage released by the organisers of the Face of Leonardo: Images of a Genius exhibition in Taipei shows the boy – in shorts, trainers, a blue Puma T-shirt and holding a drink – walk past the still life, catching his foot and stumbling over. He looks up at the canvas, shown later to have a fist-sized gash at the bottom, and freezes, looking around at other people in the room. … [The] exhibition organiser, Sun Chi-hsuan, said the boy was very nervous but should not be blamed and the painting, part of a private collection, was insured.” [Ain’t no party like a manatee party - Reacting to Monday’s kicker about a pile of amorous sea cows, Fox News First reader Karen Morrow offered this: “My husband and I had the same experience one Sunday years ago when we counted 15 manatees by our boathouse dock on the Hillsborough River, 10 minutes from downtown Tampa.

"Buzz Cut: • Hillary flips for amnesty • Rubio rocket ride continues, Walker has room to grow • Huckabee’s entry sets up Cruz duel • Carson, Fiorina still largely unknown • Go soak your head","1960","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/05/hillary-flips-for-amnesty.html"
"HILLARY FLIPS FOR AMNESTY Hillary Clinton is looking to unload some more baggage from her campaign van today. The presumptive Democratic nominee campaigns in Nevada where her campaign told several news outlets that she will embrace “a full and equal path to citizenship” for illegal immigrants. In 2008, Clinton wasn’t even a supporter of the mainstream Democratic position of allowing illegal immigrants to have driver’s licenses. Now she is ready to go for a full amnesty. USA Today reports that Clinton is embracing President Obama’s immigration policy and campaign style today: “She will chat with Rancho High School students who are DREAMers, the term used for young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.” [Stephen Dinan points out that Clinton isn’t just reversing herself, but the tough immigration policies put forward by her husband.] This latest reversal follows Clinton flips on tough-on-crime drug laws and gay marriage. Presumably more will follow. Remember that this is the woman whose former fellow cabinet member Robert Gates said admitted opposing the Iraq surge to win support among anti-war Democrats. Despite a new poll that shows that a stout majority of Democrats think a Clinton coronation will be just fine, she’s not taking any chances this time, either. One supposes that the major threat for Clinton now is not an external foe but the ongoing self-destruct sequence as the campaign tries and fails to put to rest mounting allegations of corruption against the candidate and her family. The same poll from the WSJ and NBC News that shows Democrats taking a submissive posture shows Clinton crashing with the general electorate. She’s seen as untrustworthy by a 2-to-1 ratio. RUBIO ROCKET RIDE CONTINUES, WALKER HAS ROOM TO GROW The same WSJ/NBC News poll shows Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., continuing his post announcement surge. As Republicans increasingly tune in to the wide-open race, Rubio may trail bush by 5 points, but his 41 percent combined first and second choice is very impressive. He’s drawing from two wings of the party while Jeb Bush’s support remains in an establishment Republican stovepipe. Everyone knows him and most don’t like him. But Scott Walker is hovering in deep water waiting for his moment. While Rubio is well known from his time in the Senate and frequent national television appearances, Walker still has very low name identification, even among Republicans. He’s in third place, but 21 percent of GOP primary voters don’t even know his name compared to 9 percent for Rubio and 1 percent for Bush. Those that know him seem to like him and he has not yet announced. Walker, as Bush might say, has a right to rise. Jeb’s wife, son head to Chicago - Chicago Sun-Times: “The wife and son of all but declared presidential hopeful Jeb Bush hit Chicago on Thursday for a fundraiser where the ask ranges from $2,500 for one ticket to $250,000 to give or raise. The money is for the Bush super pac, ‘Right to Rise,’ which is underwriting the initial stages of the former Florida governor’s 2016 presidential run. The headliners for the Chicago event are Columba Bush and Jeb Bush Jr. who will appear at a luncheon at the Union League Club…” Rubio to speak at annual Florida GOP dinner, no invite to Jeb yet - Miami Herald: “Don’t expect the Miami-Dade Republican Party to take sides in the 2016 presidential primary. But the GOP is giving contender Marco Rubio top billing at its Lincoln Day Dinner in June. There's no mention of the other likely candidate from Miami, Jeb Bush, on the party's invitation. Rubio will be the keynote speaker for the June 20 event, with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera listed as a ‘special guest.’ Lopez-Cantera, a close Rubio friend, could jump into the U.S. Senate race to replace him.” [Rubio will deliver his first policy speech as a presidential candidate in on May 13. He will address the Council on Foreign Relations in New York to outline his national security framework.] Walker scorches Obama, Clinton on Islamist threat - The Hill: “[Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker] said he was “disturbed” that Clinton spent four years as Obama’s closest advisor on foreign policy matters. “We need a president for this country who will look the American people in the eye and have the courage to tell them the truth,” Walker boomed. “It could be a day, a week, a month or a year, but we know it’s not a question of if there will be another attempt on American soil, it’s question of when there will be another attempt on American soil…and I’d rather take the fight to them than let them bring the fight to us.” … “Now more than ever America needs a commander-in-chief that will stand up and declare radical Islam is a threat to us all,” he said to a standing ovation. “We need a president who identified for once and for all that Israel is an ally and actually starts acting like it.” Rand advocates for racial fairness in drug laws - Detroit Free-Press: “U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky drew loud applause in the heart of western Michigan Monday when he delivered a key plank of his Republican presidential campaign - that the nation's drug policy is disproportionately putting blacks behind bars. Paul delivered a similar message when he opened a GOP office in Detroit in December of 2013.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Ever marveled at those nighttime satellite views that show a dark North Korea while an electrified South Korea glows with lights? Slate invites you to take a gander at a 1910 map of the 5.8 million places in the U.S. where you could place a call via the Bell Telephone System. “By the time this map was printed, Bell had tried several different strategies, clean and dirty, to fight back against its competition…Theodore N. Vail, who took over in 1907, changed strategies, accepting limited government regulation while buying competitors or bringing them into the Bell system…. Some rural areas—Oklahoma, Iowa, northern and eastern Texas—are surprisingly well-covered, while others in the Southeast remain empty. The discrepancy between coverage in the East and the West is perhaps the most striking aspect of the map. California remains sparsely served, and no long-distance lines reach all the way from coast to coast.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The former governor of Arkansas is a populist favorite, but that does not mean he will have an easy time cracking into the top tier. A new WSJ/NBC News poll shows Huckabee in sixth place among GOP presidential hopefuls, trailing Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, by 5 points. Both have the same aim: to unite tea party and evangelical voters. Huckabee’s challenge, both nationally and in the conservative crucible of the Iowa caucuses, is to change perceptions of himself and his candidacy – to remind voters that he can be a fighter and a champion for social conservatives and blue-collar voters. With Cruz’s high profile and deep pockets, he and Huckabee are set up for a duel across Iowa’s 99 counties for the support of true believers. Huckabee vital statistics * 59 years old, born in Hope, Ark. * Parents Mae and Dorsey Wiles Huckabee * Ouachita Baptist University, B.A. 1975 * Lost bid to unseat Sen.

Carson does worse with 36 percent not knowing who he is, but 22 percent certain they wouldn’t vote for him. “I have lived all over the world, traveled and worked all over the world. And I know that it is only in the United States of America that a young woman can start as a secretary and go on to become the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world. That is only possible here.”- Carly Fiorina on “The Kelly File” Iowans skeptical of Carson - Des Moines Register: “Iowans who have heard of Ben Carson know the broad strokes about his life…But they’re less certain about where he stands on important issues, or if there’s an avenue for victory for him in Iowa...On Tuesday, Carson intends to hit the campaign trail hard, with several public and private events in Iowa…Expect Carson’s message about opportunity to draw the most diverse audiences of any Republican contender in the race, his Iowa strategist, Ryan Rhodes, said.” [Carson resumes his Iowa schedule after cancelling events to spend time with his ailing mother. Today, Carson has a town hall meeting with Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa.] He’s going to Jackson - New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie heads to Jackson, Miss. and Baton Rouge, La. meet and greets today on behalf of his super PAC. Given thenews back home, Christie probably could use a little Southern hospitality. SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX “Kasich came out strong and ready on Sunday, elevating him to the top spot for me. Likewise, Carly Fiorina, comes over as a strong contender, although not for number 1. Kasich and Fiorina in 2016 will win it.” – Charlie McCartan “Only ONE (‘potential’) candidate has served as a Governor of a large state, AND is the ONLY one to have served in the Armed Forces of the United States, as far as I know - Governor Rick Perry. We need someone who has run a government (Texas for 14 years) and has a strong understanding of what it will take to solve our national security problems. Remember how Gov. Perry handled the border issue when Obama wouldn’t.” – Doug Mathes “Democrats have got to be confused. Running for President as Republicans are a woman, an African-American, and two Hispanics, constituencies which are supposed to belong to the Democrat Party. Maybe the Republican Party is more ‘big tent’ than some would have us believe.”– Mary Heller DECISION TIME FOR MCCONNELL ON IRAN NUKE BILL The bill giving Congress the power to review a nuclear deal with Iran is at a critical stage in the Senate as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decides whether to shut down debate on the measure, The Hill reports. “McConnell is seeking an agreement to allow votes on several controversial amendments backed by conservatives that supporters of the bill say would kill it…The full [Republican] conference is expected to talk about the Iran bill at their Tuesday lunch….[S]ome Republicans predicted McConnell may have no choice but to file cloture to end debate…While this could anger conservatives, it would also save a carefully crafted compromise drawn up by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and reluctantly endorsed by the White House.” Reid threatens Obama trade pact - Minority leader Harry Reid says Senate Democrats will block Senate consideration of President Obama’s top trade priority until a transportation funding measure and reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are passed first. Reid, who has been openly opposed to the president’s Trans-Pacific Partnership authority, told HuffPo he’s confident Democrats will stick together on the demand. “‘I’m not willing to lay over and play dead on trade until we have some commitment from them on surface transportation,’ he said. The same goes for FISA, he said.” No hot towels - The Hill: “A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to prevent members of Congress from using official funds for first-class airfare. Reps. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) said that luxury air travel is ‘especially wasteful’ while Congress has yet to eliminate the federal deficit….The bill from Gosar and Ruiz, titled the Coach-Only Airfare for Capitol Hill (COACH) Act, would mandate that lawmakers and staffers can only fly first-class with personal funds….” GO SOAK YOUR HEAD However annoying last year’s “Ice Bucket Challenge” was for you, it’s nothing compared to the experience of one California police officer who finds herself, ahem, in hot water. AP reports: “Los Angeles County prosecutors say a video posted online in July showed Pasadena police officer Jaime Robison pick up a 5-gallon bucket of ice water and pour it over a fellow officer while she was receiving disability benefits. The case also alleges the 39-year-old Robison exaggerated injuries in 2012 to receive disability pay. Robison pleaded not guilty Friday to four counts of insurance fraud. She is scheduled to return to court June 10. If convicted, she could face up to six years and four months in jail.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “[Ben Carson] does not speak like a politician. But I think he is. This is really hard to do what he is trying to do. And I think the reason he stumbled in last few months over certain issues is because it is really hard to go from being a top college player to being only not only in the major leagues but immediately in the world series. It takes a lot of experience.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Watch here. Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"DONALD TRUMP IDENTIFIES AS A PERSON OF SERIOUSNESS Donald Trump has presented in the past as a Democratic donor, a Perotist, a reality-show star and areal-estate mogul. But today, Trump is sharing his new identity with America: a serious contender for the Republican nomination. Ranked by Forbes as the 133rdrichest person in America, Trump’s fame combined with the diffuse support in the GOP electorate, gives him a unique opportunity. He currently ranks eighth in the Real Clear Politics average of polls with 3.6 percent, ahead of six others, including the current governors of Ohio and Louisiana and the former governor of Texas. And it would no doubt be pretty tough to have a distinguished public life and accomplishments are overshadowed by the man who made this commercial. If Trump can sustain his spot and make the necessary financial disclosures, he could make the top 10 for the Aug. 6 Fox News debate – a coup for him and for journalists who have been looking to dust off “clown car” ledes for GOP primary coverage. But Trump, whose presidential flirtations date back 20 years, isn’t really the story. The story is about a party that is so anxious to avoid mistakes that it seems frozen. Conservatives in particular cannot bring themselves to decide or even cull their field. Looking at it one way, the first contest is more than seven months away and Republicans are right to bide their time to see what develops and who else might show up. Looking at it another way, the longer Republicans wait to sort themselves out, the more likely they will be to do what they have done in the previous two cycles and pit an underfunded conservative favorite against a deep-pocketed establishmentarian in an embittering home-stretch fight. Republicans who really believe that the field is wide open ought to look again at Jeb Bush’s announcement speech in Miami on Tuesday. Gone was the reticent candidate and present was an enthusiastic, combative candidate who was firing hard at Democrats and, obliquely, at his home-state rival Marco Rubio. Bush was touting his conservative bona fides, but he was also making an electability argument. And as it becomes clearer and clearer that Democrats are not flinching when it comes to rallying behind the House of Clinton, Bush’s electability argument will gain strength. The narrative will gather for the Game of Thrones election. Meanwhile, conservatives having seen their efforts come to naught in previous cycles are decisively undecided. Voters are sorting through their options like kids with baseball cards. Could it be the political neophyte surgeon? The bass-playing preacher-turned-politician? The firebrand freshman senator from Texas? Pick ‘em. Trade ‘em. Collect ‘em all! But conservatives ought to remember that if the field were not so crowded, Trump’s less than 4 percent would be an irrelevancy. But with conservatives split eight ways, Trump is in the discussion. [Watch Fox: Senior Correspondent Eric Shawn reports on the Trump announcement from New York] Bush takes aim at Rubio - National Review: “…Much of [Jeb’s campaign launch] seemed implicitly targeted at [Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.]…The two share a fundraising base in Florida, making Rubio a serious rival for donors and supporters in the crucial primary state and across the country. The Bush campaign made clear Monday that it is aware of the threat posed by the younger Florida politician. An hour before Bush took the stage, a surrogate told the audience that she wanted to introduce “a couple of people” who support him. She then read off a laundry list of former and current officeholders and party operatives…” On to New Hampshire - Bush holds a town hall event in Derry, N.H., where he will also sit down with Sean Hannity for his first post-announcement interview. Watch “Hannity” tonight at 10 p.m. ET. Also tonight, Bush chats with Jimmy Fallon the “Tonight Show.” [Watch Fox: Chief Political Correspondent Campaign Carl Cameron is on the trail with Bush in Derry, N.H.] Rubio calls out Obama, sideswipes Rand - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in a Time magazine op-ed writes about the dangers of President Obama’s foreign policy agenda, specifically allowing the Patriot Act’s data collection to expire. But his fellow Republicans get a dose too: “Unfortunately, misinformation, fear-mongering and the allure of campaign fundraising all contributed to [the Patriot Act’s data collection] expiration, its explicit prohibition in the future, and its replacement with a weaker and untested system that fails to require phone companies to maintain records that we may one day need to track terrorists. Rather than use what power remains in his bully pulpit, President Obama opted to be a bystander and let this program be killed…As a result, the American people are now less safe.” Walker eyeing July 13? - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports, “…three insiders said the Republican governor and his campaign staff are targeting July 13 as the date for Walker to make the big announcement. There has been some discussion of having it later in that week, but most have settled on July 13, a Monday.” Walker’s team has yet to confirm or deny this. Carson, Walker, Rubio, Bush stay out front in new poll - In a Monmouth University poll out Monday, Ben Carson leads the pack with 11 percent up 4 points from the university’s last poll in April. Carson is closely followed by Walker at 10 percent, and Floridians Bush and Rubio tied at 9 percent. The numbers slowly dwindle down from there showing more than anything that the GOP nomination is pretty well up for grabs. [Carson holds a rally at the University of Nevada at Reno.] Kasich makes few ripples in S.C. - Ohio Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, made his way through the Palmetto State. How did it go? The Columbus Dispatch headline was looking for a silver lining: “Kasich’s candor appreciated by the few who show up to listen.”Kasich is in Michigan today for a meet and greet with the small business association in Lansing. Later, he attends a reception with Ingham County Republican in Mason. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… When the Moleskine notebook debuted in1997, it was marketed in J. Peterman fashion – a product for romantics and travelers in a society going paperless. But within a few years of its introduction, the product’s popularity surged in the high-tech world. The New Yorker explains the phenomenon that put the distinctive notebooks in the hands of MIT students, entrepreneurs, and even tech-giants. The reason, says David Allen creator of the time-management method, “Getting Things Done,” is that note-taking or to-do lists on the iPhone are interrupted by an incoming text, email, call, or all of the above. A notebook is only filled with what you put into it. So whether free writing ideas or making a lengthy list put the screen aside and reach for an old-fashioned pad and pen.

One source told Fox News the newly submitted emails from Sidney Blumenthal show a ‘significant gap’ in the record. Blumenthal was scheduled to testify in closed session Tuesday to the House panel probing the Benghazi attacks about frequent emails on Libya he sent to Hillary Clinton when she served as secretary of state. Blumenthal worked in the White House under President Clinton and is a longtime friend and adviser to the Clinton family.” NYT: “The committee has asked the State Department and Mrs. Clinton several times in the past year for emails from her and other department officials about ‘weapons located or found in’ Libya and about the decision to open and maintain a diplomatic mission in Benghazi…. It is not clear whether the State Department possesses the emails between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Blumenthal and did not hand them over. It is also possible that Mrs. Clinton never provided them to the department and deleted them off the server that housed the personal account she used exclusively when she was secretary of state.” Clintons soaked small charities- The Clinton Foundation has raked in $11M in payments from small non-profit groups for speeches by Hillary, Bill and Chelsea, Politico reports. “When Condoleezza Rice headlined a 2009 fundraising luncheon for the Boys and Girls Club of Long Beach, she collected a $60,000 speaking fee, then donated almost all of it back to the club ... Hillary Clinton was not so generous to the small charity ... Clinton collected $200,000 to speak at the same event five years later, but she donated nothing back to the club ... Instead, Clinton steered her speaking fee to her family's own ... charity.” Oh, Hill no: Campaign fights with press over coverage - Fox News: “The simmering dispute over media access to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign erupted again Monday when a reporter for DailyMail.com was told by the campaign he couldn’t attend her events in New Hampshire. David Martosko, a reporter for DailyMail.com, a website affiliated with the Daily Mail in London, said the Clinton camp said his newspaper wasn’t part of the official group -- known as the print pool -- that covers the White House on a rotating basis. As a result, he was blocked Monday from covering her events in person for the pool…. The campaign said it is trying to resolve the issue. However, it denied any suggestion that Martosko was denied access because of his newspaper’s critical coverage of Clinton….Major media organizations in Clinton’s traveling press pool issued a statement Monday night defending Martosko and rejecting any attempt by the Clinton campaign to “dictate” who covers the candidate. “…[T]his is just one thing that she doesn’t get to control. She wants press covering her. That whole goal for politicians is to have the people covering them. And then we the press get this idea, but one of them is, who is going to go in there and represent us. And now the campaign, first they came out and they said, well, you’re foreign press. And you responded by saying, there’s lots of foreign press and they’ve acted as pool before.” -- David Martosko, U.S. political editor for the Daily Mail on “The Kelly File” [Press Secretary Josh Earnest defended keeping secret a 500-guest White House concert featuring Prince and Stevie Wonder, saying the event was a personal affair for the Obamas and “not part of the responsibilities of the president and first lady.”] Dems beat war drums on trade - President Obama’s defenders dished back to Hillary Clinton a day after the candidate told the president he “should listen to and work with his allies in Congress who rejected his bid for trade authority and if he can’t get a better deal, “there should be no deal."" In a remarkably timely CNN article on Clinton’s waffling and how she wants to “take the lemons and turn it into lemonade,"" Jake Tapper writes, “ But as members of the Obama administration can attest, Clinton was one of the leading drivers of the TPP when Secretary of State. Here are 45 instances when she approvingly invoked the trade bill about which she is now expressing concerns.” “[S]he called the TPP, she said it was going to be the gold standard for trade agreements, so this is very, very freighted for her. This is difficult terrain to navigate because she owned this to some degree and now she has to try navigate through it. So it's going to be challenging for her. – former Obama adviser David Axelrod on MSNBC. Bernie ‘stunned’ by huge crowds - NPR reports that Clinton rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is “stunned” at the large crowds he’s drawing. “Sanders takes this — we'll call it ""Bernie-mentum"" — as a sign his message is breaking through….Sanders is…attracting some of the same types of voters who have been drawn in the past to libertarian Republican Ron Paul and 2004 Democratic candidate Howard Dean. But to some observers like Des Moines-based Democratic strategist Norm Sterzenbach, the question is whether he'll be able to capitalize on it. ""Will he put the team together that knows how to move those people from event attendees to volunteers, to precinct captains to caucus goers?"" he asked. Sanders has an event scheduled Saturday in Denver, and already more than 3,000 people have registered to attend. Decision time for Webb - AP: “[F]ormer Virginia senator [Jim Webb] said Monday he expects to make a decision on a 2016 Democratic bid by the end of the month….Webb says he’s assessing if he can raise enough money because he doesn’t want to run just ‘a protest campaign.’” [Webb has a pair of events in Iowa today, including a speech to the Des Moines Committee on Foreign Relations.] Banana split time – Fox News Junior Reporter Lauren Blanchard reports from the trail on a Webb campaign scheduling snafu that left some potential caucus-goers with sticky fingers. SOUND OFF: READERS REACT TO THE POWER INDEX “First choice is Scott Walker. He has faced the music in his home state & survived beyond what everyone expected. Once he comes out officially, he'll knock all others off. My second choice is Marco Rubio. He is a natural & a great young face. Only down side is no governorship.” – Julie Mudric “In your GOP Power Index you show Carly Fiorina at No. 4, yet most of the polls show her out of the Top-10. As you can ascertain, I’m a fan, and I think that she would be ideal as a VP…To have a shot, however, she has to be heard and seen, and with FOX’s rules for the first debate, I’m afraid that she won’t make the Top-10 cut against the name brands now in the race.” – Ron Way “I think Bernie Sanders could be like Eugene McCarthy in 1968. He attracts students and the anti-war crowd like McCarthy did. He is going to give Clinton a run for her money.” – Ben Wright LEAVE THE GUN, TAKE THE BACON KETV: “A man arrested on suspicion of burglary over the weekend is accused of only taking two items from a Lincoln home. Police said Justin Morris, 29, was found passed out on the front lawn of a home…Next to him, police said, was a 42-inch flat-screen TV; a package of bacon was found in his pocket. About 12 hours later and two blocks from where Morris was found, a woman reported a burglary at her apartment. The only two items taken were a TV and a pound of Farmland thick-cut bacon. Police said Morris was arrested at his home in connection with the burglary and taken to the Lancaster County Jail.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"From fiery criticism of ObamaCare and the Iran nuclear deal to support for Israel and the rights of the unborn, the top 10 Republican presidential candidates did all they could to define and separate themselves Thursday night during the Fox News debate in Cleveland, Ohio. The governors on stage, notably John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, touted their economic records. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz vowed to scrap the Iran deal. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson reminded voters in his closing remarks of the professional background that separates him from the rest: “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins.” Throughout the debate, Donald Trump was the unrivaled lightning rod, but the prime-time showdown made clear he’s not the only fighter on the stage – or in the race. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reclaimed his reputation as a tough-talking executive, blasting his rivals for their positions on domestic surveillance and entitlements. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul traded barbs with several candidates, including Christie. Meanwhile, one-time front-runner former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush found himself on defense several times and largely avoided tangling with Trump on the Fox News/Facebook stage. Perhaps the most fiery moment came in an exchange between Christie and Paul. Long-simmering tension between the two exploded when Christie stood by his criticism of the senator for opposing NSA bulk collection of Americans’ phone data. Paul said he’s “proud of standing for the Bill of Rights,” but Christie called his stance “completely ridiculous” – suggesting he wants to cherry-pick only some data. “When you’re sitting in the subcommittee just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that,” Christie said. Paul fired back: “I know you gave [President Obama] a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go ahead.” Christie said the hugs he gave were to the families of 9/11 victims, and then accused Paul of playing “politics,” by using videos of floor speeches to raise money. The exchange was striking, even in a debate that was tense from the start. Though several rivals stood out, Trump did not hold his fire, either – making clear he’s not softening his approach to campaigning as he picks up steam in the polls. If anything, the debate signaled the primary race is about to get tougher and is still wide open as 17 candidates vie for the lead with months to go until the opening contests. Trump, the billionaire businessman front-runner, sparred at the outset of the debate with Paul after refusing to pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee if it’s not him and to swear off an independent run. “I will not make the pledge at this time,” Trump said. Paul accused him of “hedging his bet on the Clintons.” “He’s already hedging his bets, because he’s used to buying politicians,” Paul said. (Trump later acknowledged he gave money to the Clintons and demanded Hillary Clinton “be at my wedding” in exchange; he called this a sign of a broken system.) Trump also stood firm on his vow to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal immigration,” Trump said, blasting “stupid leaders” in the U.S. harboring illegal immigrants. Bush said a comprehensive solution is needed, including a “path to earned legal status,” which he said is not “amnesty.” Moments later, Cruz said some on stage support “amnesty”, while he does not. A big question going into the debate was whether Bush would aggressively challenge Trump and try to knock him off his perch. But he would only go so far as to question Trump’s tone, calling his language “divisive.” Hours before the debate, Politico ran a story saying Bush recently told a donor he thinks Trump is a “buffoon” and a “clown.” Asked about that report on stage, Bush denied it. “It’s not true,” Bush said. Trump then called Bush a “true gentleman.” As for his tone, Trump said it’s “medieval times” in the Middle East, and, “We don’t have time for tone.” But other candidates were able to stand out on the crowded stage. Carson called Hillary Clinton the “epitome” of the progressive movement. “She counts on the fact that people are uninformed. The Alinsky model, taking advantage of useful idiots,” he said. Walker also blasted the Iran nuclear deal, as did other candidates: “This is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS, it is tied together and once and for all we need a leader who is going to do something about it. It is yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio landed laughs when, upon being asked about his faith in God, he said: “I think God has blessed us, he’s blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can’t even find one.” Rubio also vowed to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and called the lack of accountability after the Veterans Affairs scandal “outrageous.” Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee vowed to defend entitlements and stood his ground on social issues. He blasted Planned Parenthood and defended his pro-life views, accusing abortion providers of “selling” fetal parts “like they’re parts to a Buick.” Kasich, like Walker and Bush, tried to keep the focus on his record in his state. “America is a miracle country and we have to restore the sense that the miracle will apply to you,” he said. And Cruz vowed, if elected, to prosecute Planned Parenthood, cancel the Iran nuclear deal and nix Obama’s executive orders. “I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth,” he said. Trump was challenged several times on his conservative views. He previously was pro-choice, but said he’s “evolved” on the issue. Also, under questioning from moderator Megyn Kelly about past disparaging comments he made about women, Trump interrupted to say, “Only Rosie O’Donnell.” He then said, “Honestly, Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry.” The candidates squared off at the second of two kick-off debates, hosted by Fox News and Facebook in conjunction with the Ohio Republican Party. The seven other Republican hopefuls spent much of the first debate doing their best to hammer home the message that Clinton represents four more years of Obama. In the earlier debate, the candidates largely avoided sparring with each other and instead trained their fire on the Obama years -- with promises to roll back ObamaCare and undo the Iran nuclear deal.","Published August 07, 2015","2018","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/sparks-fly-at-opening-gop-debate-as-trump-wont-pledge-no-independent-run.html"

"HOUSE MEMBERS PUSH FOR IRS CLINTON PROBE Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., is circulating a letter among her colleagues asking IRS Commissioner John Koskinen to review the tax-exempt status of the Clinton Foundation. In the letter, a draft of which was obtained by Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel, Blackburn says, “recent media reports have revealed that the Foundation failed to report millions of dollars in grants from foreign governments that it accepted while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and that it facilitated private business transactions between foreign entities” and as such, “given the substantial public interest involved, we feel a prompt review of the Foundation’s tax-exempt status is appropriate to determine whether it is acting within the scope of its charitable mission.” Stephanopoulos gave $50K to Clinton Foundation - Fox News: “ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos never disclosed to his network -- or viewers -- $50,000 in contributions he made to the Clinton Foundation in recent years, even as he waded into covering Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and foundation controversies. Stephanopoulos apologized Thursday, Fox News has learned, and said he should have revealed the contributions. The anchor is a former Bill Clinton spokesman and aide, and his ties to the former first family are well-known. However, as first reported by Politico, he made a $25,000 donation to the foundation in 2013 and 2014 -- and while the donations can be found in the organization's records, Stephanopoulos did not disclose them…” Clinton Foundation donor flails in interview - WashEx: “A major Clinton Foundation donor who stood to profit immensely from the highly scrutinized takeover of Uranium One by the Russian government struggled to explain his involvement with the charity under questioning Tuesday. Frank Holmes, one of several investors cited in a New York Times article about the deal, attempted to dismiss allegations that he had donated to the Clinton Foundation in an effort to secure Hillary Clinton's approval for the 2010 transaction during an interview on CNBC's ‘Squawk Box.’ Several of his claims directly contradicted statements that flashed on the screen while he was speaking. A fact box on the screen indicated U.S. Global Investors, of which Holmes is CEO, held $4.7 million in shares of Uranium during the first quarter of 2011. But Holmes said his company was ‘long gone before 2008.’” [Ed Henry reports candidate Hillary Clinton will make her second trip to Iowa on May 18 and 19.

Aides also confirmed to Fox that O'Malley will tell donors and supporters about his Baltimore announcement in a conference call Thursday night….Later this week, O'Malley will attend meetings with longtime supporters in the Washington D.C. suburbs, some of Maryland's most solidly Democratic areas.

But how we know that is what makes Florida the opposite of weird, and actually makes it pretty great. The Miami New Times points out Florida’s Government in the Sunshine Act, which allows people access to all kinds of public records with few exceptions is what leads to easy access to mug shots, police reports, and direct knowledge of government happenings not available to reporters in most other states. It’s also why there is an abundance of ‘weird Florida news’ on the internet.

Carson, who clocked in at 6 percent last month, now stands tied with Jeb Bush at 13 percent. Bush made gains as well, climbing 4 points since the previous survey. Close behind Bush and Carson: Scott Walker at 11 points and Mike Huckabee at 10 points. Marco Rubio saw his post-announcement gains largely evaporate. He slipped 4 points to 9 percent and fifth place overall. Also losing ground were Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Paul lost 3 points and Cruz lost 2 points. Bush fared best among potential rivals to Hillary Clinton, with 45 percent to her 44 percent.

Would he have gone to war in Iraq, given what we know now? Rubio, a freshman Republican senator, said no. After giving his first major policy speech since announcing his candidacy a month ago, Rubio was asked the question that rival and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was recently asked. Bush has said he misunderstood the question and backed away from his response, which initially was to say he would have authorized the war — even knowing what we know now. … Rubio said no. “Not only would I not have been in favor of it, President [George W.

The cul de sac in a new residential development was named in memory of well-known villager Frank Bangay who died in 1999. But a married gay couple, who have lived in the village for almost seven years and have asked not to be named, want it changed. One of them said: ‘My husband and I went to look round the new development. Having got over the initial humour, we reflected that this street name was actually pretty offensive.’” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “What I think is impressive is that when you poll Democrats there is very little erosion because no alternative [to Hillary Clinton].

"DEMS TOY WITH BERNIE AS HILLARY SEES SWING STATE DROP The bad news for Hillary Clinton today comes in two polls. One is from New Hampshire that shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders getting to within 10 points of Clinton and another that shows her trailing in must-win Ohio and knotted up against less-known potential GOP rivals in swing states Florida and Pennsylvania. The New Hampshire poll tells us that Democrats are thinking this election is in the bag and are indulging themselves with the idea of offering symbolic support for a self-described socialist who favors a policy list that would make swing and independent blanch. Trillions of spending and new taxes on everything from free college to global warming are not winners for debt-averse, economically insecure suburbanites. Republican voters, after two heartbreaking quadrennial elections, are kicking old habits with an eye on retaking the White House. Democrats, though, may be trying to get back on the Hopium in a misplaced belief that their victory is inevitable. If Democratic voters get Sanders into the discussion with Clinton and potentially even force her to adopt even more of his far-out positions, the party will be badly damaging its chances. Driven substantially by her falling trustworthiness, Clinton finds herself in trouble compared to three months ago in Quinnipiac University’s swing-state poll. Clinton does best on Florida (not good news for either of the favorite sons running there) but in all three, the results are fairly consistent. Take Ohio. In March, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was trailing Clinton by 9 points. This week, it’s down to 1 point. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker trailed in a head-to-head matchup by 11 points. Now it’s 4 points. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rand Paul improved by 6 points and 5 points, respectively. And the state’s Gov. John Kasich went from a 1-point deficit in January to a 7-point advantage today. Some if this is a result of Clinton’s policy changes and efforts to identify herself as a partisan figure and a very liberal one at that, but another part is that voters increasingly distrust her. But the net effect is to damage her standing with general-election voters. And herein we see another problem with “inevitable” candidates: They struggle to get their parties in line because they lack the powerful political motivator of fear. GOWDY: HILLARY’S LIBYA SOURCE WAS FUNNELING ‘INTEL’ FROM POTENTIAL PROFITEER Fox News: “Longtime Clinton insider Sidney Blumenthal was ‘merely a conduit’ and did not write the numerous memos about Libya he forwarded to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the chairman of the House panel investigating the deadly 2012 Benghazi attacks said Tuesday. Blumenthal was forwarding information from someone who may have had business interests in Libya, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly after Blumenthal spent nearly nine hours at the Capitol as Gowdy’s committee met in closed session…. ‘Not only was [Blumenthal] providing unvetted, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated intelligence to our top diplomat, he was just simply forwarding on intelligence that somebody by the name of Tyler Drumheller was sending him,’ Gowdy said.” “[Clinton] used the word ‘unsolicited’…When these emails are released, I want you to count the number of times she says ‘keep ‘em coming’ ‘this is great’ ‘useful information.’ I don’t know what her definition of unsolicited is, but it is very strikingly different from my own.”— Benghazi committee chairman, Trey Gowdy on “The Kelly File.” Watch the interview here. Gate crasher - The Hill: “Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) tried to crash former Hillary Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal’s deposition before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Tuesday. Issa marched into the closed-door deposition and remained inside for about a minute before he was escorted out by the panel’s chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). The pair briefly exchanged hushed words in a nearby hallway before Issa stormed off, throwing an empty soda can into a nearby trash bin.” [Incomplete accounting - WSJ provides the documents’ current state of play and why it matters.] Trade still looms for Dems - Fortune: “The House is giving itself until the end of July to reconsider denying President Obama the negotiating authority he needs to wrap up a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade pact…Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters Tuesday the decision came after several conversations with Obama about the way forward.” Dems fume over new Obama/GOP trade plan - WashEx reports that the idea that Obama might accept a GOP plan to pass a narrower trade bill is creating an uproar in Democratic ranks. “I think he would really, really piss off the majority of his party” if he went along with such a scenario, said Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., one of the most conservative members of the Congressional Black Caucus who sometimes votes with Republicans, but opposes fast track. Dems waffle on Defense - National Journal: “Senate Democrats were against defense authorization before they were for it. Or maybe it’s the other way around. Either way, their message is mixed: They fully support the troops, but they really don’t like how Republicans are supporting the troops with contingency war funds.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Christopher Lee’s iconic villains may have some inspiration from real life horror. Lee, who died at age 92 earlier this month, was witness to the last public execution in France done by guillotine. The executed that day was Eugène Weidmann, a man convicted of several murders and kidnappings in the area. Women waited after his execution to dip their handkerchiefs in his blood. Authorities realized that instead of creating a public deterrent for crime, public executions riled public passions. Lee witnessed Weidmann’s beheading 76 years ago today.

Jeb Bush’s well-executed opening campaign rally and sharply written, succinctly orated speech calmed jitters and left the governor's backers in about as confident a position as they were when he shook up the race in December when he signaled his intention to seek the nomination.”] But does he have a Harley? - Scott Walker filed for president Tuesday, according to the Federal Elections Commission. No, not that one. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s camp says he is still un-declared. Instead a same-name candidate joined the nearly 100 Republicans who have who have made their intention known to the FEC. Carly takes ‘The View’- Legal Insurrection’s Amy Miller gives analysis of Carly Fiorina’s performance on all ladies talk show. Miller writes, “At around the 3:40 mark, the lovely ladies steered the conversation toward the problem of Fox and CNN using polling data to decide which candidates will be allowed to participate in the initial debates. It didn’t feel like a malicious question, but it did put her in a vulnerable position. This would have been a perfect opportunity for Fiorina to knock Fox, or white male presidential candidates, or the polling system in general, but she didn’t do it. Instead, she dropped a ‘started from the bottom now I’m here’ nugget, and looked confident when she said, ‘I’m kind of used to being underestimated, so I’m sort of assuming I might make it to those first [debates].’” [Fiorina’s campaign Carly for America came under fire earlier this year due to the F.E.C. rule that PAC names cannot contain the name of a candidate.

Read more from Carson’s interview here. Schake warns GOP on electoral quagmire - Hoover Institution’s Kori Schake writes that Republicans can’t win on their foreign policy platform alone. Despite President Obama’s dive in popularity for his foreign policy agenda Schake says the Republicans also don’t have a coherent strategy. As she writes, “Many candidates are allowing themselves to be drawn into debating troop levels for Iraq without explaining either the political objective that military force would achieve…” GOOD OLD REGULATION 27, SECTION 37 Germany is famed for its orderly towns and cities, but sometimes it gets a little, um, verrückt. The Local tells the tale of a traffic light in Germany that never changes to green. Why? Well, according to the local authorities, “Because on [that street] one is only allowed to turn right, in accordance with regulation 27, section 37 of the transport regulations, we can do without using the traffic signal’s green light.” Then why not just have a stop sign? “Stop signs do not correspond to traffic light systems and do not fulfill the same set of regulations.” The orderliness even continues to the finances: the annual budget includes amber and green replacement bulbs, just in case. AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “…It would be analytic overkill to go, to parse the actual things [Donald Trump] said. I think it was great showmanship, it was stream of consciousness. I think single most important statement was ‘I am very rich.’ That’s the basis for the campaign...I can assure you one thing: the mainstream media who wished the Republicans no good will lavish upon him enormous coverage.” — Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

He’s also second to The Donald in South Carolina.","2042","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"
"The retired neurosurgeon is quietly riding the wave of anger at professional politicians, and he is temperamentally Trump’s opposite, soft-spoken and self-effacing. Carson has a quiet charisma, and while he is not miles deep on some issues, that seems to matter less this year.","2043","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"
"But let me venture a prediction. Since journalists haven’t viewed the doctor as a serious threat for the Republican nomination, Carson hasn’t gotten much tough media scrutiny. That is about to change.","2044","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"
"Take the recent disclosure that Carson was engaged in fetal tissue research in 1992. He has an explanation as to why that is different than what Planned Parenthood does in helping harvest organs for sale, which he has criticized. The story was a bit of a blip, quickly vanishing from the radar. Had Carson been treated as a front-runner, it would have been chewed over for days.","2045","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"
"At the same time, Carson has greatly improved as a candidate. In his early months on the trail, he kept making rookie media mistakes, which made me initially think he was not ready for prime time.","2046","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"
"There was the time he likened ObamaCare to slavery.

"Iowa is a good state for Carson because of its many evangelical voters.

"In a USA Today op-ed last week, Carson said the anger of Black Lives Matter demonstrators is misdirected: “Of course, the protesters are right that racial policing issues exist and some rotten policemen took actions that killed innocent people. Those actions were inexcusable and they should be prosecuted to deter such acts in the future.","2053","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"
"“But unjust treatment from police did not fill our inner cities with people who face growing hopelessness. Young men and women can't find jobs.

We want honor and dignity.”","2055","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"

"The Christian Science Monitor observes that a “dimension that cannot go unstated is that Carson is African-American, important to Republicans tired of being reminded that they are woefully deficient in their support among minorities. He is, to some, the Republicans’ Barack Obama – and perhaps even more authentically black than President Obama, who grew up in Hawaii and was raised largely by his white mother and her parents.”","2058","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"
"What about his broader message? A National Review cover story notes “an interesting contrast between Carson’s rhetorical style — mild-mannered, low-affect; a surgeon’s calm — and his content, which is blunt and apocalyptic: If we do not act now, America as we know it will cease to exist. President Obama and the progressive Left have done their best to destroy the nation from within…","2059","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"

"The magazine also chides Carson for having “a way of hitting odd, uncomfortable, and over-the-top notes. References to ‘socialism’ and ‘totalitarianism’ creep into his speeches (an oblique reminder that he has said contemporary America is ‘very much like Nazi Germany’). He talks about the ‘wars’ the president has tried to stir up: ‘race wars’ and ‘age wars.’ He recommends framing policies not as ‘conservative’ or ‘liberal,’ but as ‘pro-American’ or ‘anti-American.’ Even if you know what he’s getting at, it’s a bit much.”","2061","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/02/ben-carsons-surge-how-raised-his-game-under-media-radar.html"

"Jonathan Greenblatt, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, quickly objected, stating that there were few firearms available to Jews in Germany in 1938 and that surrendering them did not measurably contribute to the totalitarian power of the Nazi German state.","2066","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/09/ben-carson-is-right-about-jews-holocaust-and-guns.html"

"What Greenblatt fails to account for is that the surrendering of firearms by Jews when required to by Nazi authorities was not merely the surrender of guns and ammunition. Those material items would not have been sufficient to defend against the Third Reich’s military.","2069","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/09/ben-carson-is-right-about-jews-holocaust-and-guns.html"
"The mindset that Jews surrendered with their guns is far more important than the hardware they turned over: They surrendered the demonstrated intention, at all costs, to resist being deprived of liberty. If Jews in Germany had more actively resisted the Nazi party or the Nazi regime and had diagnosed it as a malignant and deadly cancer from the start, there would, indeed, have been a chance for the people of that country and the world to be moved to action by their bold refusal to be enslaved.","2070","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/09/ben-carson-is-right-about-jews-holocaust-and-guns.html"
"Yes, that would have required immeasurable courage. Yes, that would have required unspeakable losses. But is that not the lesson of the Old Testament?

Must not we all be ready to sacrifice ourselves to stand in the way of evil?","2071","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/09/ben-carson-is-right-about-jews-holocaust-and-guns.html"
"Granted, I was not there. Granted, hindsight is 20/20. But it turns out it was a bad idea for any Jew to have turned over a gun. It was a bad idea for any Jew to have boarded a train. It was a bad idea for any Jew to have passed through a gate into a camp. It was a bad idea for any Jew to do any work at any such camp. It was a bad idea for any Jew to not attempt to crush the skull or scratch out the eyes of any Nazi who turned his back for one moment. And every bullet that would have been fired into a Nazi coming to a doorway to confiscate a gun from a Jew would have been a sacred bullet.","2072","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/09/ben-carson-is-right-about-jews-holocaust-and-guns.html"

"The wisest answer to a government that insists its citizens disarm is, “Over my dead body.” It would seem to be the end of any discussion and the beginning of active, heroic resistance. Because it is very hard to imagine that disempowering citizens by having them render themselves defenseless can lead to anything good. It is very likely a sign that the culture has fallen ill and that an epidemic of enslavement of one kind or another is on the horizon.","2074","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/09/ben-carson-is-right-about-jews-holocaust-and-guns.html"

"Late Monday, Carson took to Facebook to slam calls by Democrats for more gun control legislation in the aftermath of the shooting. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton rolled out several proposals to address gun violence this week, including using executive action as president to expand background check requirements.

"WHY VOTERS LIKE BEN CARSON Why is Ben Carson the single most popular candidate running for president in either party? As Carson moves into a tie with Donald Trump in the latest Quinnipiac University national Republican primary poll, the retired neurosurgeon is blowing the doors off every candidate – including Hillary Clinton – when it comes to the general electorate. Carson runs better against Clinton than any GOP contender in hypothetical general election matchup, romping to a 10-point lead. Among the three other top-tier GOP candidates, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both defeated Clinton by 5 points and 3 points respectively while Trump trails Clinton by 3 points. We’re still almost a year out from Election Day, so these matchups are meaningless as predictive properties. But they do reveal the depth of Clinton’s predicament and the remarkable height Carson is obtaining. Among both general election voters and Republicans, Carson and Rubio are the best liked candidates, though Carly Fiorina also shows appeal in her party and with all voters. But consider this: Carson has a favorability score 34 points higher than Clinton’s. Americans might vote for a candidate they do not like. Americans might even vote for a candidate they do not trust, but Democrats ought to be more than a little seasick at the thought that their presumptive nominee is 10 points underwater with the national electorate on favorability and 24 points (!) underwater on honesty. But again, why is Carson the most popular candidate in the country? To get your answer, consider the least liked candidate in either party: Jeb Bush. Bush, who has a net favorability rating of negative 33 points, has made personal attacks a hallmark of late. He first attacked Trump, who is the ne plus ultra of character attackers. But Bush has most recently been attacking the character of his onetime protégé, Rubio. Bush’s attacks on Trump have sometimes been issue-based, but with Rubio, Bush attacks his younger rival as unfit and unready for office, comparing him to President Obama. That’s not Ronald Reagan hitting Gerald Ford on the Panama Canal or Mitt Romney clubbing Rick Perry over Social Security. This is personal, more in the vein of the hits Romney took from rivals Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for Romney’s work at Bain Capital, attacks that teed up the ball for Obama in the general election. Attacks cost favorability for both the attacked and the attacker. It’s like an intentional foul in a football game. It’s only worth the penalty of it keeps the other team from scoring and keeps you in the game. Trump’s persistent personal attacks have been part of what has left him unable to expand his reach within his party. Bush’s attacks have proven even more costly. He fell 26 points on favorability with the general electorate since Quinnipiac’s September poll and 38 percent just among Republicans. Team Bush is looking to reboot, but with Bush loyalists pushing hard on Rubio’s spotty personal financial past – one Bush loyalist emailed today calling for Rubio to release a decade of his credit scores – it seems clear that the personal attacks will persist. Carson’s opponents have mostly avoided attacking him, except, of course, Trump, a move which has plainly backfired. Attacking Carson, a kindly, Christian man with an inspiring life story, is hard to do. And Carson goes to great pains to avoid saying unkind things about his rivals. Like Cruz and Rubio, Carson looks for ways to praise rather than blame his fellow Republicans. And voters reward them. The lesson: If you want to fight your intra-party foes, do it on substance not character. New poll shows big movement for Rubio in the Granite State - WBUR: “A new WBUR poll in New Hampshire shows establishment outsiders Donald Trump and Ben Carson are still leading in the Republican primary race there, but some of the other candidates are making new headway… Florida Sen. [Marco] Rubio’s support more than quintupled, from 2 percent to 11 percent, while New Jersey Gov. Christie’s support rose from 2 percent to 8 percent. Both candidates are also seeing big jumps in their favorability ratings.” Rubio gets second Senate endorsement - The Hill: “Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is picking up his second endorsement for president from a fellow senator in as many days. ‘I’m endorsing Marco Rubio for President,’ said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) in a statement on Tuesday…Rubio’s first Senate endorsement came from Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) on Monday…” Dr. Cruz is in - James Pinkerton credits Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for his support of better treatments and cures for pernicious illnesses like Alzheimer’s and cancer, which the former adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush says will be the key message for the GOP in fighting the Democratic narrative on health issues in 2016. Cruz is following in the footsteps of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee who has made this approach a centerpiece of his campaign. Jeb to France: Je suis désolé - Time: “Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush lightheartedly apologized to the people of France on Tuesday for making fun of their work week during last week’s Republican debate…when he was trying to highlight rival Marco Rubio’s poor voting record in the Senate. ‘I made the mistake of saying that the Congress operates on a French work week,’ he deadpanned. ‘I really did a disservice to the French,’ Bush added with a chuckle Tuesday. ‘My inbox was full of French journalists,’ piped in campaign spokesman Tim Miller.” Jeb thunders in N.H. speech - Bloomberg: “…the former Florida governor practically yelled through his stump speech to a crowd at a house event hosted by ex-senator Scott Brown before taking questions from the audience. ‘We’re Americans, dammit!’ he thundered, as he talked up his boilerplate proposals to cut taxes, lift regulations, boost the military and take aim at President Barack Obama’s policies.” POWER PLAY: DEBATING DEBATES, IN 60 SECONDS There’s a great deal of hoopla over the fact the Republican presidential candidates are at odds over the format of GOP debates.

The Atlantic describes its historic journey: “In August 1963, Merloyd Lawrence wrote a dispatch in The Atlantic from Barcelona, mentioning many of the city’s…buildings designed by Antoni Gaudí…Lawrence describes the Iglesia de la Sagrada Família, Gaudí’s most famous building, as an ‘unfinished, uninhibited cathedral in which stone explodes into botanical fantasies or overflows like molten wax.’ 52 years after Lawrence’s piece appeared in The Atlantic and 132 years after construction began in 1883, the magnificent Sagrada Família has reached its final stage of construction. … When it’s finished, the basilica will be the tallest religious building in Europe, standing at 564 feet.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

The biggest surprise of the night came from the Kentucky governor’s race where Republican Matt Bevin and Democrat Jack Conway were expected to have an extremely tight contest for a seat Democrats have held for all but four of the past 44 years. Bevin trounced his opponent with a nearly 9-point victory, however, creating shock waves around the state. That’s good news for Sen. Rand Paul who can continue to run for president for a while longer. And an interesting factoid: the party that won the Kentucky gubernatorial election for the previous 3 cycles has also won the presidency. Kentucky adds its name to the list of unpredicted Republican victories in between the last two election cycles, drawing many questions about how polling keeps getting things so wrong. Pollsters in the Bluegrass state apparently did not expect the 17 percent turnout surge from 2011’s gubernatorial race in Kentucky, just as they did not expect Gov. Larry Hogan’s shocking upset last year in the Maryland’s governor’s race. Looks like the persistent challenges of polling, or perhaps the wrong assumption of the pollsters. Ohio says no to Mary Jane by a wide margin - Columbus Dispatch: “Ohioans pushed a monopoly marijuana-legalization proposal out the door Tuesday by a nearly 2-to-1 vote. But the question is, will pot make a comeback? Although Issue 3 was handily defeated, the debate and conversations about the issue have convinced House Speaker Cliff Rosenberg, R-Clarksville, and other state lawmakers who were staunchly opposed to legalization to now say it may be time to move ahead with medical marijuana.” Multi-gender bathrooms stall in Texas - Fox News: “An ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston failed to win approval from voters on Tuesday. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was rejected after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.” [The Illinois school superintendent whose district is being ordered by the Department of Education to allow a transgendered student access to the women’s locker room appeared on “The Kelly File.” Watch here.] HILLARY MOVES LEFT AGAIN ON GUNS, MINIMUM WAGE What’s up with Hillary Clinton? The latest national poll out today from Quinnipiac University puts her up 18 points over Bernie Sanders. The same poll says 54 percent of Democrats supporting Clinton made up their minds and only 8 percent say they would definitely not support her. And she has overtaken Sanders in the latest polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire. But despite the apparent lock on the nomination she’s digging a deeper hole with the general electorate. Tuesday saw Clinton aggressively pushing stricter gun control measures, which she wants to make a “voting issue.” That may please the left now but could prove costly in the general, especially in swing states where tighter restrictions on gun rights strike a nerve. And if that wasn’t enough for one day, Clinton says she wants the federal minimum wage boosted to $12 per hour, an increase of almost 70 percent and a move that could cost jobs. Clinton may be bringing the hammer down on Sanders, but at what cost? Bad omen in Virginia - WaPo: “Republicans held onto the Virginia Senate in fiercely contested elections Tuesday, leaving Gov. Terry McAuliffe without legislative leverage or political momentum as he works to deliver Virginia for his friend and ally Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016. The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe (D), who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda.” [Good luck in Paris - NYT: “China, the world’s leading emitter of greenhouse gases from coal, has been burning up to 17 percent more coal a year than the government previously disclosed, according to newly released data.] From nun to ‘none’ - According to a recent Pew Research survey cited by WaPo “…shows is that people who do not identify with any organized religion (aka the ‘nones’) comprise the largest chunk of self-identified Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic party. And, that number has increased by almost 10 percentage points since Pew last conducted a similar study back in 2007.” Oops - At an NAACP banquet in Charleston, S.C. Hillary Clinton promised that under her administration, “former presidents won’t have to declare their criminal history at the very start of the hiring process.” Is there something Bill isn’t telling us?

The Aviation Herald reports the cargo flight from Australia to Kuala Lumpur, with 4 crew and 2186 sheep on-board, was flying just to the south of Indonesia when the smoke alarms sounded on October 26. Crew on-board SQ-7108 descended the aircraft immediately and diverted to Bali where they landed about 45 minutes later. Emergency services didn’t find any trace of fire or smoke and identified the cause to be the result of exhaust gasses and manure produced by the sheep.

"GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who just announced that he raised $20.2 million in the last quarter and is one point behind GOP front runner Donald Trump in the latest Fox News poll, pushed back Friday against a report he has put his campaign on hold to promote his new book.","Published October 17, 2015","2525","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"
"ABC News reported on Thursday that beyond private fundraising events, Carson was taking “two more weeks” off from the campaign trail to focus on the book, “A More Perfect Union,” which was released on Oct. 6. It was co-written with his wife Candy Carson.","2526","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"
"A political follow-up to ""One Nation,"" released in 2014, Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, says ""A More Perfect Union"" is supposed “to encourage every citizen to read and think about the Constitution, and to help defend it from those who misinterpret and undermine it.”","2527","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"
"The ABC News report said Carson’s campaign likes to maintain a bright line between the book promotion and his GOP bid, and that beyond private fundraisers, he would not be making any public campaign appearances until the next CNBC-sponsored Republican debate on Oct. 28.","2528","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"
"The story also points out that Carson’s last public campaign appearance was Oct. 2.","2529","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"
"But Carson fired back Friday on Facebook, calling the ABC report “carelessly false.”","2530","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"
"“In the next three weeks, I have 25 fundraisers, a national debate, several public appearances and dozens of book signings from Texas to Iowa,” he writes to his supporters on Facebook. “I don’t see any time off in the coming three weeks.”","2531","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"
"The ABC News story suggested that the campaign did not want to be perceived as “using campaign assets to sell books,” and noted that none of Carson's campaign staff would be accompanying him during promotional appearances.","2532","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"
"Carson spokesman Doug Watts said he has been raking in the donations, raising $3 million so far in October, and has been ubiquitous in the media throughout the month.","2533","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"
"“He’s been on TV. I think Wednesday through Friday I got sick of looking at him on TV,” Watts said. “So it’s pretty hard to suggest that he’s not out and about. Whether you make a distinction of it as a campaign thing or not.”","2534","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/16/carson-fires-back-on-report-is-taking-time-off-to-promote-book.html"

"If you want an in-depth analysis of where we are in the 2016 race for the GOP nomination, I suggest you download the 1972 film “The Thing With Two Heads.” This high-camp cult classic stars veteran actor Ray Milland (in what was the indisputable low point of his career) as a dying brain surgeon who arranges to have his head surgically transplanted onto the body of the first available healthy person—who happens to be a falsely accused death-row inmate played by football great Rosey Greer.","Published October 26, 2015","2536","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"I thought about my favorite movie from high school when I saw national polls revealing that Donald Trump and Ben Carson are tied in their lead for the block of 50 million evangelical Christian voters. Who would have ever predicted that these two improbable and polar opposite candidates would be the two “heads” sitting atop the body of evangelical Christian voters?","2537","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"The usual explanation by pundits is that these two men’s “outsider” status has propelled their popularity. Because both Carson and Trump have never been professional politicians, they are not shackled by political correctness or joined at the hip with special interest groups. But that is where the similarities end. There are vast differences in their world-views, temperaments, life experiences, and even in their perceived spirituality. Yet they are garnering the lion’s share of the votes of the most conservative Christians in America. Why?","2538","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"As different as Carson and Trump are, each one represents one-half of the equation of what evangelical voters are looking for in the next president: a committed Christian and a strong leader, which is why outsider Ben Carson is tied with Trump in national polls for evangelical voters and has zoomed past him in Iowa where you find some of the most conservative evangelical voters in the nation.","2539","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"Ben Carson’s evangelical devotees are attracted to many aspects of the acclaimed surgeon’s character—but at the core of their support is Carson’s uncontested commitment to Christianity. Secularists are always astounded that a large segment of Americans would care about a potential candidate’s faith. Since faith is unimportant to the secularist, why should it be a concern of anyone’s? But for people whose faith matters--well--faith matters! Most evangelicals believe that a candidate’s faith—or lack thereof—profoundly impacts every area of his life, including his world-view. Any candidate who professes to be deeply religious but says in the next breath that his faith would have no impact on how he would govern is either a superficial follower of his faith or a liar. If our faith is the most important part of our lives, then our religious views influence every other part of our lives, including our political views.","2540","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"Ben Carson incited a major controversy when he suggested that he wouldn’t be comfortable with a Muslim president. Some commentators and even Republican leaders accused Carson of being unfit to serve as president since his comments reflected an ignorance of Article VI of the Constitution which prohibits imposing a “religious test” for public office. Yet, anyone who understands the Constitution knows that Article VI refers to a governmental religious litmus test, not the preferences of individual voters.","2541","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"Ben Carson—along with every American—is free to impose any litmus test he chooses, including a religious one. Interestingly, John Jay who was the first chief justice of the United States Supreme Court and co-author of the Federalist Papers, suggested that Americans utilize a religious litmus test that would give preference to Christian candidates: ""Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.” More than two hundred years later, many Americans still believe that there are practical reasons for selecting a committed Christian for president, which is why outsider Ben Carson is virutally tied for first place among evangelical Republicans.","2542","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"But the other “head” atop the evangelical body—Donald J. Trump—represents evangelicals’ equally strong desire for the next president to be a strong leader. Like most Americans, evangelicals believe that this nation is on the “wrong track” and are looking for someone who can fix the economy, solve the immigration debacle, and protect American security. Enter Mr. Trump.","2543","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"While no one is going to accuse The Donald of being overly pious, he is perceived by many evangelicals as someone who can tackle tough issues. Last week I was on a plane, seated next to a woman in her mid-sixties who identified herself as a Christian and explained her support for Trump: “I’m tired of all the B.S. (and she didn’t mean “Bible study”). I’m looking for someone who can get something done and Trump’s the guy who can do it.” The next day on my return trip a young flight attendant knelt by the side of my seat and--when no one was looking--whispered, “Thank you for saying some positive things about Trump. I think he’s the only hope for our country.”","2544","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"After criss-crossing the country for the past few months and talking to thousands of people, I’m convinced that there are a legion of “closeted” evangelical Trump supporters who are almost apologetic for being attracted to him. They are not under any illusion that Trump will be conducting Bible studies in the Oval Office, nor do they feel like they are abandoning their Christian values to support Trump. Instead, this time around, they are simply weighting “strong leader” more heavily than “committed Christian” in the presidential equation.","2545","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"
"Which “head”—and the presidential qualifications each represents—will ultimately prevail over the evangelical body of voters? All I can say with any confidence is that like the movie “The Thing With Two Heads” this contest is incredulous, somewhat entertaining, and will be ultimately resolved with a “The End.”","2546","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/26/trump-and-carson-evangelicals-incredible-two-headed-transplant.html"

"Donald Trump, after holding back at last week's debate, challenged Ben Carson's fitness for office on Tuesday, saying ""Ben can't do the job.""","Published November 03, 2015","2549","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"He blasted Carson after a second poll showed the retired neurosurgeon taking the lead over Trump nationally. The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed Carson leading Trump, 29-23 percent, among GOP primary voters. Asked about the findings on Fox News, Trump said he doesn't know what it is about Carson that's attracting a following.","2550","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"""I like Ben, but Ben can't do the job, I mean there's no question about it,"" Trump said. ""He's not going to be able to negotiate with China. It's not his thing ... It's not in his wheelhouse, he's never done it before, and I don't think it's, you know, meant for him.""","2551","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"Trump went on to call Carson ""very weak on immigration"" and called his position on Medicare the ""end of his campaign.""","2552","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"Trump asserted that Carson wants to end Medicare -- though Carson recently told ""Fox News Sunday"" that's no longer the case. Carson said he changed his mind after talking to a lot of economists.","2553","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"""That was the old plan,"" Carson recently ""Fox News Sunday,"" saying he now prefers so-called health savings accounts as an alternative to Medicare.","2554","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"The same WSJ/NBC poll also showed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz surging, with 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Further, it showed 77 percent of Republicans saying they would at least consider supporting Carson -- 17 points higher than for Trump.","2555","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"Though Trump is back to attacking Carson, both candidates are effectively outsiders in a race still heavily populated by current and former senators and governors. Carson, defending his appeal in a recent interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" said the government was set up for ""citizen statesmen, not for career politicians.""","2556","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"Carson has mostly avoided criticizing any other candidates, at debates and off-stage.","2557","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"Trump, too, avoided sparring with Carson at last week's debate in Colorado. The candidates instead ended up banding together, during and after the debate, to criticize the CNBC moderators -- and, in the last couple days, seek changes in the debate process.","2558","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"That push, though, remains in flux. More than a dozen campaigns met in suburban Washington on Sunday, a meeting that produced a draft letter to debate host networks seeking assurances on a range of topics -- including assurances that candidates would be allowed to give opening and closing statements.","2559","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"
"But Trump has since thrown a wrench into that push by saying the campaign would continue to ""negotiate directly"" with networks on debate criteria. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former HP CEO Carly Fiorina also have not signed onto the new push, though other campaigns are reviewing the letter. The push for changes is not expected to affect the upcoming Nov. 10 GOP debate, hosted by Fox Business Network.","2560","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"

"The book speaks directly to voters, making the case that Trump has the experience and business savvy to accomplish things that traditional, all-talk, no-action politicians can't. It comes as Trump is continuing to adjust to a new phase of the campaign in which the once undisputed front-runner is now facing heightened competition from a number of his GOP rivals.","2562","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/03/ben-cant-do-job-trump-rips-carson-after-latest-poll.html"

"And yet that prompted the presidential candidate to denounce CNN for peddling “garbage” that he dismissed as a “smear.”","2568","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"A day later, Carson accused Politico of an “outright lie” for reporting that he had falsely claimed in his autobiography to have been offered a full scholarship to West Point.","2569","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"Carson seems deeply offended that journalists are digging into his past and challenging his veracity, though that’s standard procedure in presidential campaigns. At the same time, he’s scoring points against the unpopular media, which have overreached at times in digging into the doctor’s past.","2570","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"These biographical details may matter more to Carson than to most candidates, since his inspiring life story—from an impoverished childhood with a single mother to world-class neurosurgeon—is the bedrock foundation of his campaign.","2571","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"The irony is that Carson’s quiet dignity and low-key temperament are a major source of his appeal. But in denouncing the media in recent days, he looks downright angry.","2572","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"What CNN set out to do by talking to old friends and neighbors was not a smear. The network never accused Carson of lying, but reported that nine people interviewed had said violent outbursts would seem utterly out of character for him.","2573","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"But the clear implication was that Carson had perhaps been exaggerating the stabbing incident and another in which he said he almost hit his mother with a hammer. The network didn’t have the goods and probably should have held the piece for more reporting.","2574","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"The story prompted Carson to acknowledge to Megyn Kelly that the person he tried to stab was not a friend, as he said in his autobiography, using a phony name, but a close relative. And then he had an epic on-air battle with CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota, insisting with some justification that the people the network interviewed would have no way of knowing about violent incidents in his past.","2575","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"The next day came the screaming Politico headline that Carson had admitted fabricating a story about West Point. This was way overstated, which was underscored when the website greatly softened the headline.","2576","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"Carson told Bill O’Reilly that he was not in fact offered a scholarship to West Point, but was told he’d have an “easy” time if he applied. And applying—all cadets attend free—is a complicated process that requires sponsorship by a member of Congress or secretary of the Army.","2577","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"The Wall Street Journal joined the fray over the weekend, questioning, among other things, an anecdote in which Carson says when his fellow black high school students erupted in anger after the murder of Martin Luther King, “he protected a few white students from the attacks by hiding them.” But the paper could not prove it didn’t happen.","2578","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"These distinctions and discrepancies undoubtedly seem miniscule to Carson’s fans, who have pushed him into a neck-and-neck competition with Donald Trump in national polls. The same goes for the flaps over what Carson has said about the Pyramids, Nazi Germany and other off-topic subjects.","2579","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"A more experienced politician would be accustomed to the scrapes and scratches inflicted by media scrutiny. Of course, Ben Carson prides himself on not being a politician.","2580","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"When I spoke with him at length last spring, Carson said he considered the media to be biased, but seemed rather Zen about it. Now he seems appalled, as he made clear at a contentious Florida news conference on Friday.","2581","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"For most people, relitigating what happened 50 years ago, when Carson was a teenager, seems like overkill. And there was a telling moment yesterday on “Meet the Press”: Asked whether his mother (who Carson says he almost hit with a hammer) couldn’t come forward to clarify some of these incidents, the candidate said: “My mother has Alzheimer’s.” That put things in perspective.","2582","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"
"But whether the scrutiny is reasonable or overzealous, Carson should recognize that this is the price of admission for the people who want to be president.","2583","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/09/carsons-war-on-politico-cnn-and-media-has-scrutiny-gone-too-far.html"

"The Democrats brought in a far greater take than the Republican candidates, in part because there are fewer of them vying for the party's donor base.

Meanwhile, Cruz's campaign said he had a total of 120,000 donors through the third quarter.

"In the video, Carson says: ""My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids in order to store grain."" He was referring to the Old Testament story of Joseph predicting famine and advising the pharaoh to store surplus food. He said that's more likely than the accepted archaeological conclusion that the massive structures were built as tombs for pharaohs.","2707","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/05/carson-stands-by-statement-pyramids-in-egypt-built-by-biblical-figure-joseph.html"

"""Some people believe in the Bible like I do and don't find that to be silly at all, and believe that God created the earth and don't find that to be silly at all,"" Carson said.

"It's not immediately clear, however, that Carson's church or any other major Jewish or Christian sect shares his belief about the pyramids' origins.

"Another front-runner, businessman Donald Trump, has suggested that Carson's religious beliefs put him outside mainstream American Christianity. At one October rally in Florida, Trump called his own Presbyterian church ""middle of the road"" before adding, ""I mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don't know about.""","2716","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/05/carson-stands-by-statement-pyramids-in-egypt-built-by-biblical-figure-joseph.html"
"In an interview with the Associated Press, conducted after Trump's remarks, Carson said he expects in politics to have his religious affiliation questioned, but he defended his faith and his church. ""There are a lot of people who have a close relationship with God, and you can generally tell who they are by the way they act, the way they treat other people,"" he told AP. ""The reason that there are like 4,000 denominations is that people have looked at this and said, 'Let's interpret it this way.

"A first-time political candidate, Carson has a penchant for headline-grabbing statements beyond matters of faith.

"Fiorina was once again an incredibly strong debater, holding her own and then some.

"As the latest Fox News poll shows, it’s been a rough week for Carson. And he can blame both his tormenter-in-chief, Donald Trump, and also the shift in voters’ focus to Islamist terrorism. The single largest shift in the poll is Carson’s 5-point slide. The reason is no mystery. Just as Carson was weathering an intense round of character attacks from Trump, who rails against the well-liked Carson as dishonest and unstable, a more intense round of the commander-in-chief test was initiated by the Paris attacks. Thinking about a mild-mannered physician as president is one thing in the summertime when the headlines are dominated by presidential horserace coverage. But when winter is coming on and voters are made to confront the possibility of a large-scale attack on our shores, the conversation changes. Trump bumps up 2 points in the poll and two spots in the Power Index for his successful attacks on Carson. It may not much widen his path to the nomination, but Trump’s scorched-earth personal attacks achieved their goal here: the diminution of Ben Carson. The big winners in this poll, as well as last week’s Bloomberg survey, are the two rising stars of the GOP field who have been atop the Power Index for several weeks: Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Both have made foreign policy major parts of their appeals to voters and both take a hard line on ISIS & Co. The senators each gained 3 points to move into a tie for third. There was some troubling news for another candidate. Carly Fiorina saw her share of the vote unchanged since the GOP debate two weeks ago. If her ability to translate strong debate performances into polling booms has run its course, Fiorina faces a tough climb from here. 1) Ted Cruz; 2) Marco Rubio; 3) Donald Trump [+2]; 4) Carly Fiorina [-1]; 5) Ben Carson [-1]; 6) Jeb Bush On the radar - Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum What would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

His faith and training as a Presbyterian minister inspired a show for children.

The Atlantic describes how such a simple concept changed so many young lives: “Rogers told kids they mattered, that they were worthy of love, and that emotions were to be embraced, not buried. He spoke to children like grown-ups, and helped them tackle topics such as anger, trust, honesty, courage, and sadness…Later in Rogers’s life, he recounted the story of a child who was being abused by his biological parents…Through encountering ‘Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,’ the child began to hope that there were kind people in the world and became convinced that he too should be treated with respect.

Daily Caller reports: “The link in her tweet [posted in support of a controversial documentary] went to a campaign webpage on sexual assault on campus that starts with a quote from a speech Hillary gave in September: ‘I want to send a message to every survivor of sexual assault: Don’t let anyone silence your voice.

"TRUMP GOES NUCLEAR ON CARSON, FIORINA Donald Trump has prospered as the conservative insurgencies human wrecking ball, smashing into establishment favorite Jeb Bush. But how will he fare in his fresh feuds with fellow outsiders Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina? A week ago Trump said he hoped Carson would “hit” him, because Trump “love[s] to counterpunch.” Does he ever. Carson, who is gaining fast on frontrunner Trump in a new poll today, took a mild shot at what Trump’s self-described “big league” Christian faith. Pressed by reporters during a campaign stop in Anaheim, Calif., to respond to Trump’scriticisms that Carson isn’t qualified to be president, the retired neurosurgeon initially declined. But when asked to contrast himself with the New York billionaire, Carson responded, “…I realize where my success has come from, and I don’t any way deny my faith in God,” said Carson. Carson went on to cite favorite scriptures that “humility and fear of the Lord are riches in honor and life,” saying that he didn’t get “that impression with” Trump. That was a swipe at Trump who bragged that he likely hadn’t ever felt the need to ask God’s forgiveness. On CNN today, Trump unloaded on Carson: “Look at his faith and you’re not going to find so much. And you look at his views on abortion which were horrendous, and that’s I think why I’m leading with all the evangelicals. I’m leading Ben Carson by a lot I’m almost double his numbers.” “But I don’t know Ben Carson, perhaps – you know – an okay doctor…we’re not talking about a great – he was an okay doctor.” “And now, because he’s a doctor and he hired one nurse, he’s going to end up being president of the United States?” “For him to read from the Bible in his memory, it looked like it memorized it about two minutes before he went on stage.” But Carson isn’t the only target of Trump’s wrath. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who also gained ground on Trump in CNN’s poll out today, got a dose too.","2798","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/10/trump-goes-nuclear-on-carson-fiorina.html"
"In an interview with Rolling Stone Trump mocked Fiorina’s appearance: “‘Look at that face!’ he cries. ‘Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!’ The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. ‘I mean, she’s a woman, and I’m not s’posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?’” Fiorina declined to respond in kind during an interview on “The Kelly File” saying instead, “I’m not going to spend a single cycle wondering what Donald Trump means. But maybe just maybe I’m getting under his skin a little bit because I’m climbing in the polls.” In a phone call to “Fox & Friends” today, Trump claimed he was not referring to her appearance but instead, “about persona.” But as Trump’s own comments to Rolling Stone make clear any disparagement of women’s appearances is a fraught subject for the GOP frontrunner. Trump did not, however, shy away from continuing to attack Fiorina’s record as a businesswoman and her qualifications to be president. Given the strong favorable views of Republicans voters towards Fiorina and Carson, Trump’s attack-dog approach with his fellow outsiders looks to be a much riskier gambit than his ceaseless trolling of the beleaguered Bush. WALKER JOINS FALL FASHION TREND WITH RE-BOOT AP: “Republican Scott Walker plans to talk about ‘wreaking havoc’ on Washington D.C. with a Thursday speech at the alma mater of former President Ronald Reagan. Walker's presidential campaign on Tuesday released excerpts of his speech to be delivered at Eureka College in Illinois. Walker is also expected to release weekly ‘day one’ promises that describe action he would plan to take on his first day as president. Walker has already said he will end the Iranian arms deal and propose repealing and replacing the federal health care law on his first day in office. The speech and weekly release of ‘day one’ promises comes as Walker is trying to regain ground after being among the top tier of Republican candidates, only to see his standing drop in recent polls.” [The Atlantic’s Molly Ball goes back to where it all began to look for Walker’s path forward: “For the past four years, Walker has dominated Wisconsin. His bold agenda shattered the status quo, he shocked the left and united the right, and he couldn’t be beat. Recalled in 2012, challenged in 2014, he kept on fighting and kept on winning. … For Wisconsinites accustomed to Walker’s dominance, his fall from glory nationally has been disorienting and out of character. Back home, he has always been focused, disciplined, on-message to a fault.”] Jeb gets a little Trump-y in tax plan - NYT: “Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida challenged some long-held tenets of conservative tax policy on Wednesday by proposing to curtail valuable deductions that benefit businesses and the wealthy and eliminate a loophole that has benefited hedge fund and private equity managers for years. That an establishment Republican candidate has embraced such changes not only highlights how income inequality has altered the tenor of the presidential debate for the party, but also indicates the ideological pull Donald J. Trump’s candidacy is having on the Republican field after he made similar proposals.” [Bush will talk about his tax policy and hold a town hall in New Hampshire today.] Koch group applauds - Conservative group Freedom Partners praised the GOP candidates who have come out with detailed tax reform plans. President Marc Short said in a statement, “We applaud Governor Jeb Bush, as well as Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, for providing detailed plans to lower rates, reduce corporate welfare and simplify the tax code.” Freedom Partners supports reducing tax rates, and ending corporate loopholes. FEDS FILLET CHRISTIE’S REVIVAL USA Today: “The Bridgegate scandal, dormant for months, sprung back to life with a vengeance Tuesday – a day before the second anniversary of the bridge lane closures – for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and his struggling presidential campaign. United Airlines announced that its chief executive officer had stepped down, a casualty of the airline and federal prosecutors’ inquiries into the relationship between the company’s executives and the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey… Two former Christie loyalists, Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, are scheduled to be tried in the fall on Bridgegate-related charges. David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and high-school classmate of Christie, pleaded guilty in May...

National Geographic brings today’s biggest science story of two recreational cave divers stumbling upon a new species of human ancestor called Homo naledi. Steven Tucker and Rick Hunter found a cave outside Johannesburg looking for a new adventure in an area known for fossil discoveries, and research. Although much of the area has been trodden over, Tucker and Hunter were hoping to find a new path or a less-explored area. In a narrow cave, barely big enough to fit them through, they found they would be far from disappointed, discovering what appeared to be a vast collection of human bones. But how did this cave collect so many bones? Is it possible that this species buried their dead in some way? Check out this deep read for an account of their findings here.

THE JUDGE’S RULING: TWO WRONGS DON’T MAKE A RIGHT Though he believes that the decision to incarcerate Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis wasn’t the right course of action, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says Davis’s argument in refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because of her religious convictions is flawed: “The Free Exercise Clause guarantees individuals the lawful ability to practice their religion free from government interference. It does not permit those in government to use their offices to deny the rights of those who reject their beliefs. That is the lesson for Kim Davis.” Read here. HIS BEN & JERRY’S FLAVOR: ROCKY ROAD RAGE WCAX: “Vermont state police say a man caught going more than 100 mph in Royalton was on his way to court to take care of a speeding ticket. Investigators say they received several reports Wednesday afternoon of a car going over 100 mph and weaving in and out of traffic on Interstate 89 northbound. Troopers say they clocked Seth Tichenor, 33, of West Hartford, going 112 mph in a 65 mph zone. He was arrested for excessive speed and negligent operation. Police say Tichenor told them he was headed to traffic court to take care of a speeding ticket.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “People are upset about [Hillary Clinton’s] server and secret email and all that, yes. But the most upsetting thing – and I think the real danger – is the corruption in the foundation. And I think that’s what needs to be asked: ‘Did you as a criterion for erasing stuff on the grounds that it is not public, was one of those criteria references to the foundation?’ And if her answer is yes – who knows what it will be? – but if the answer is yes, that’s what she is trying to hide.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"In announcing that a contender must average 3 percent support in polls by six major television organizations between Sept. 17 and Oct. 21, CNBC is making a sharp break with the approach followed by Fox and CNN. They both said the top 10 candidates in an average of national polls would make the main debate (though CNN bent the rules to allow Carly Fiorina an 11th spot at the Reagan Library).","2835","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/02/death-by-non-debate-why-is-cnbc-limiting-2016-field.html"

"The senator from Kentucky, the governor of New Jersey and the former governor of Arkansas are all credible candidates who have raised millions of dollars, campaigned around the country and have done endless television interviews. Why should CNBC boot them if they’re just under 3 percent? Why not 2 percent or 4 percent? (I don’t have any problem with a 1 percent cutoff, which is the minimum requirement for the undercard debate, despite early chatter that CNBC would dispense with that consolation prize.)","2838","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/02/death-by-non-debate-why-is-cnbc-limiting-2016-field.html"
"Let’s be real here: Any candidate booted from CNBC’s main Colorado debate could find himself in a death spiral. It’s like being sent from the formal dining room to the kids’ table.

"I get that all debate criteria make some folks unhappy. Fox and CNN were both criticized for the top-10 limit, which necessarily excluded some candidates.

"So why add three more questioners? Well, there’s personal finance correspondent Sharon Epperson. But there’s also the bombastic Rick Santelli, who is credited with inspiring the Tea Party movement with an on-air rant and obviously leans right. And there’s “Mad Money” guy Jim Cramer, the high-decibel host who I’ve known for a long time, and who has given big sums to Democratic candidates and obviously leans left.

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: • Jeb shifts attacks to Rubio • Power Play: Freaky Florida • Sanders and Carson cash in, Hillary and Jeb lower expectations • Classified emails pile up, weigh down Hillary • The fastest gondola JEB SHIFTS ATTACKS TO RUBIO Under pressure, Jeb Bush is hitting harder than ever against Sen. Marco Rubio, as Bush’s onetime protégé surpasses him in the polls. On the trail in New Hampshire Wednesday, Bush compared Rubio’s campaign message to that of President Obama and warned of a similar result if Rubio was elected. Pressed on his comments today in an interview with MSNBC, Bush went further. Bush said Rubio lacked the “leadership skills” and said that Rubio would not be able to “fix things” in Washington. It comes at a difficult moment for Bush as Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has, ahem, “reset” the 2016 presidential race. Russia’s offensive in Syria is a threshold moment that history will long record. Rather than just the ongoing efforts to reestablish “Great Russia” through the subduction of weak neighbor states and veiled (if thinly) military maneuvers, this is open aggression in a contested territory in the worst neighborhood in the world. And Putin’s military began the operations by targeting American-backed forces. When Moscow targets American proxies in a Third World hellhole, you know we’re all the way back to the bad old days. But as history collides with the venality of the 2016 presidential contests, it means particular problems for certain candidates, Bush among them. While he has recently embraced the idea that he is best situated to lead U.S. foreign affairs because he is “a Bush,” sorting out his brother’s Middle East legacy has proved, so far, intractable. As Bush comes to closer embrace his brother’s foreign policy, discussing how best to escalate a ground war in the region is a huge problem. Painting Rubio as unready and unsteady won’t be an easy task for Bush, though. He’s on the record from 2012 explicitly saying Rubio was more experienced than Obama and pushed Rubio as Mitt Romney’s running mate. But Bush’s shift from trying to engage with frontrunner Donald Trump to fourth-place Rubio is likely necessary given the worries that Bush’s early backers may abandon him for the ascendant Rubio. Rubio responds to Trump claims that Russian action is ‘wonderful’ - Sen. Marco Rubio responded to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s claims that Russian leader Vladimir Putin fighting ISIS in Syria is “wonderful.” On Wednesday’s “The Kelly File” Rubio said, “Well, he’s wrong about that. And it’s just a misunderstanding about the reality of this. The purpose of what the Russians are doing is not to defeat ISIS. I mean, they ultimately -- they needed to defeat ISIS in Syria in order to protect Assad. But the purpose of this is to prop-up Assad.” Watch here. “I’m putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria as part of this mass migration. If I win, they’re going back. They’re going back. I’m telling you. They’re going back.” – Donald Trump campaigning in New Hampshire [Trump customer data hacked - Time: “Hackers have infiltrated the Trump Hotel Collection in locations across the United States and Canada and perhaps stolen a year’s worth of credit card data.] Rand may get dumped from main stage for next debate - WSJ: “CNBC on Wednesday released its criteria for deciding which candidates will be allowed to participate in the Oct. 28 primetime debate, and which will be relegated to the earlier event. Candidates who average 3% in national polls conducted by NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, CNN and Bloomberg between Sept. 17 and Oct. 21 can join the top tier event…Candidates who rank at 2.5% or above in the polls have their numbers rounded up to 3%.

Drucker writes, “The RNC says it now has over 150 paid staff and 10,000 campaign volunteers scattered in key electoral battlegrounds and other states. Now, the national party wants to find out if its investment in manpower, technology and strategy development pays off in the form of a well-oiled political machine. The test, details of which were shared with the Washington Examiner, lasts throughout October… A few battleground states have been selected for extra attention and more detailed testing of the RNC plan, including Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia.” POWER PLAY: FREAKY FLORIDA GOP guru turned Georgetown Professor Brad Blakeman gives his take of the five seats most vulnerable to flip from red to blue.

McCarthy, considered the front-runner to replace retiring Speaker John Boehner, made the remarks in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity Tuesday night…[he said:] ‘And let me give you one example. Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she’s un-trustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not…’” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Do you like Ina Garten? No? Perhaps you don’t know about her, or maybe you’re just a horrible monster. Whatever the case, she is the irrepressible cookbook author and television host who is the Julia Child of her generation. You will not find her hawking cheap dishes at a discount store or hosting some game show that puts cupcake bakers in a culinary version of “The Running Man.” You will find her enjoying the tar out of life and offering, for the price of a cookbook, you permission to do the same. The food site Eater has a loving and surprising profile of “The Barefoot Contessa” as she prepares to take her 10th book to press. (She’s sold 10.6 million of the first nine installments.) And it’s really a love story. “It’s like when she saw [husband Jeffery], and ran towards a life they could make completely for themselves. With him at her side, she saw food for the very first time, and has spent her life ever since taking it apart to see what makes us tick.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 45.3 percent//Disapprove – 49.4 percent Directions of Country: Right Direction – 26.8 percent//Wrong Track – 62.5 percent SANDERS AND CARSON CASH IN, HILLARY AND JEB LOWER EXPECTATIONS The end of the fundraising quarter hit Wednesday, and the totals aren’t looking good for either party’s establishment frontrunner. Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders shows a surge in money in this quarter. Sanders’ camp reports totals exceeding $26 million, with around $25 million in ‘cash on hand,’ according to the NYT. On the GOP side, Ben Carson not only continues a strong performance in the polls, but also announced a cool $20 million sum for his campaign this past quarter. With the online activist corps churning up giant sums for insurgent candidates, the establishment better show its clout, right? Uh-oh… Hardest hit was Hillary Clinton. Her campaign raised $28 million this fundraising quarter, a major drop from the record $47.5 million of last quarter. Her campaign explained to USA Today that donors aren’t as active in August with everyone taking the last of summer vacations. Woof. What’s bound to be even more worrisome for Clinton is the news that Sanders has passed the 1 million donor mark in online donations; that’s faster than then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 who didn’t reach 1 million donors until the middle of primary season. This must feel like the replay of a nightmare for Clinton: starting the race as the obvious frontrunner only to find an insurgent from nowhere usurping what is rightfully yours. And this is without Vice President Joe Biden even in the picture… But things look just as worrisome for Jeb Bush, whose campaign is already seeking to lower expectations. Although ‘people involved with the campaign’ tell WSJ that they expect Bush to ‘surpass’ last quarter, when he raked in $11.4 million, they fail to mention that Bush was only an official candidate for six-weeks of that quarter. This fundraising deadline will be a far more important test for Bush, who continues to struggle in the polls, as he tries to persuade donors that he can gain some stable support. If Bush’s final number isn’t big enough to scare donors away from the rising Marco Rubio, his chances to dispatch his single most dangerous rival will quickly winnow. As other campaign totals roll in, a clearer narrative of the 2016 race will really start to take shape. Debate performances have been all over the map, and most of the top-tier have had their moments of shine and falter, but fundraising totals will tell if Carly Fiorina has the cash to make it through the primaries and how real Rubio’s threat is to Bush. This excludes Donald Trump who said he’s funding his own campaign, at least for now. Financials have a way of doing what the debates have been trying to do: weed out those with staying power from those who are merely a distraction. Many who fall in the latter category have hung in there with the hopes of catching fire, but ultimately it takes cash to pay the bills and those who don’t have it may have no choice on whether they can continue in this race. Puny numbers for candidates under the 5 percent line can quickly end long-shot hopes. Hillary disciplines donors - NYT: “After months of voicing doubt about a challenge from the vice president, Clinton campaign operatives are viewing Mr. Biden’s entry into the contest as a serious possibility and are trying to rally the party’s apparatus and its donors to her side. They have flooded uncommitted Democrats with emails, phone calls and a plea for them to sign a letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times.” CLASSIFIED EMAILS PILE UP, WEIGH DOWN HILLARY Fox News: “Dozens of emails in the State Department's latest release of Hillary Clinton emails contain information now deemed classified by the department. The release includes nearly 3,900 new emails. Of them, more than 200 have a ‘B1’ marking, which means they contain classified information. More than 100 of the messages were marked as ‘B5’ classification, which refers to internal deliberations by the Executive Branch and are exempt from disclosure to Congress and the public. However, some of the messages marked as such may be duplicates.” Jarrett swipes Hillary: She was warned on email - Top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett ever-so-gently backed the bus over Hillary Clinton when asked at a think-tank chin wag whether the administration provided Clinton with instructions on email hygiene. “Yes, there were. Yeah, absolutely. … [T]here was guidance given that government business should be done on government emails, and that if you did use a private email, it should be turned over.” Pro-Republican group America Rising has the clip. In 2011, Hillary opposed nod to same-sex families, feared Palin - NRO: “An email included in the latest tranche of Clinton documents released by the State Department on Wednesday shows the then-secretary of state exploding at her staff over plans to replace ‘Mother’ and ‘Father’ with ‘Parent One’ and ‘Parent Two’ on passport application forms, complaining about the decision and refusing to defend it in the face of partisan opposition…[Clinton wrote:] ‘I could live w letting people in nontraditional families choose another descriptor so long as we retained the presumption of mother and father. We need to address this today or we will be facing a huge Fox-generated media storm led by [Sarah] Palin et al.’” THE JUDGES RULING: TOWARD A MODERN PAPACY? While many see Pope Francis’ new approach as a way to open the Church to non-believers Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano rules that this could actually damage the Church writing, “What if this papacy of novelty is as unsuccessful as Vatican II and churches soon empty because the Church changes with the wind, embraces the cult of personality and is disinterested in the Truth?” THE FASTEST GONDOLA UPI: “Police in Rome shared a snapshot of a man who was given a warning for cruising the Tiber River in an unusual boat -- a modified vintage Maserati car. The 40-year-old Italian man was stopped Sunday on the Tiber by Rome police and investigators confirmed his boat was a former sports car outfitted with an outboard motor and an open top to allow the man to stand while steering. Police said the man, who they determined had been warned by police numerous times in various locations for riding in his Maserati boat without proper authorization, told officers he started his journey in La Spezia and was trying to get to Venice.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “The United States is told by Russia one hour earlier that they’re going to go and attack ISIS. The Soviet Ministry announces they hit ISIS targets. Everyone knows it is a lie. Like all the lies that were issued in the Ukraine.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"There was no urgent need for Trump to pile on, giving the media’s role in driving these stories. But he has an unerring instinct for an opponent’s weakness.","2928","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"So using a word from Carson’s autobiography to describe his temper as a teenager, Trump told the crowd: “He said he's pathological and got a pathological disease. I don't want a person who's got pathological disease. If you're pathological, there's no cure for that, folks. I did one of the shows today, I said that if you're a child molester, a sick puppy, there's no cure for that.”","2929","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"Child molester? That’s quite a pivot.","2930","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"Then he mocked the stabbing story, grabbing his belt, his voice dripping with sarcasm: “He took a knife and went after a friend and lunged but low and behold it hit the belt and the knife broke. Give me a break.”","2931","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"And he questioned whether the people of Iowa, and the country, were “stupid” to “believe this crap.”","2932","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"The media’s tone in reporting on this has ranged from disapproval to disbelief—this time he’s gone too far, he was desperate, he was way over the top. And it was over the top. Take this New York Times headline: “Some See Attacks by Donald Trump As Start of His Downfall.” Some see—I wonder who.","2933","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"How many times have we been through these media predictions of Trump’s imminent demise? What Trump’s fans love about him is that he does go too far, that he entertains by being outrageous, because they see that as thumbing his nose at a discredited political establishment.","2934","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"Carson, who has had very tough words for the media and their ""lies,"" always deflects questions about Trump’s assaults. When I interviewed him last week, he dialed things down by calmly explaining the meaning of the word pathological.","2935","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"At a news conference on Friday, he talked about a “gratuitous attack” without using Trump’s name. He also invoked a signature Bill Clinton phrase from the 1992 campaign, “the politics of personal destruction.”","2936","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"It would tarnish Carson’s brand to get into a street fight with Trump, who, in rhetorical terms, always carries a knife. And while Carson’s reticence often frustrates reporters, that calm, measured approach is at the heart of his appeal to voters.","2937","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"Why would a candidate volunteer that he tried to knife someone and almost hit his mother in the head with a hammer? Because his is a story of redemption. He found religion a half century ago, turned his life around and became a leading neurosurgeon.","2938","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"When I asked him about his account of his teenage years, Carson said: “Well, I believe in full disclosure, and if I hadn't revealed that, then that would have been a story. Because then you say”—here he lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper—“do you know what this guy did, oh my God.”","2939","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"From Trump’s perspective, the swipes against Carson both raise doubt about his temperament and reinforce the billionaire’s reputation for toughness. His camp sees the same dynamic in his immigration message—which now comes with talk of a “deportation force”—in that Trump is the guy who knocks heads and speaks uncomfortable truths. And the appalling terror attacks in Paris will only reinforce that message.","2940","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"
"Whether Trump goes too far—or whether voters see him as an insult comic taking on worthy targets—won’t truly be known until the Iowa caucuses.","2941","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/16/trumps-attacks-on-carsons-crap-why-hes-not-backing-down.html"

"""He said what I hope I would do is fight back. That’s what we all hope. We never know until we're in that situation. He wasn’t casting judgment on anyone. Just asking what he would do.

"As for Boulder, Colo., the site of Wednesday night’s third GOP debate: It’s a college town whose voting-age population is five-sixths registered Democrats.

"A topic mostly overlooked in the first two debates, but taking center stage in round three: tax reform. For the 10 candidates, this is a soup-to-nuts menu: Jeb Bush’s plan to lower the top personal rate from 39.6 percent to 28 percent Marco Rubio weighs in at 35 percent, while eliminating estate and capital-gains taxes); Ben Carson’s 10 percent flat tax Rand Paul has it at 14.5 percent; Ted Cruz wanting to abolish the Internal Revenue Service; Trump (no Jolly Old Saint Nick, he) as the “Santa Claus” of the bunch.","2960","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/27/four-things-to-look-for-at-wednesday-nights-republican-debate.html"

"There’s a school of thought among some campaign observers that too much money has clouded Bush’s judgment: It gave him a false sense of security and it kept him from pressing grassroots activists with more urgency. A weak debate performance in Colorado, more trail gaffes and a further downward spiraling in the polls will have one benefit for Bush: There’ll be fewer donors to worry about offending.","2965","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/27/four-things-to-look-for-at-wednesday-nights-republican-debate.html"

"Let’s assume Trump takes another swing at Carson – and Bush and Rubio and Cruz and any other bystander. Will CNBC’s moderators give Carson the “front-runner treatment” and put him through a wringer of tough questions? In the previous two debates, Carson benefited from a large field and Trump’s oversized persona. It allowed him to say precious little – which, ironically, plays into his nonconformist brand.
