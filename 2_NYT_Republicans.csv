"Note that line about “the rigors of competition.” Lee and others of like mind are shifting the focus of populist anger from liberal elites to economic elites.

Their revision would raise the refundable child care credit to $3,500 from $1,000.

"Not only can conservatives offer reforms that are both pro-growth and pro-family — we absolutely must do so in order to earn the trust and support of millions of Americans who are working hard to raise families and make a middle-class living.

"The 2014 midterm elections demonstrated, however, that relatively modest shifts in tone — carefully combined with cost-free proposals like making over-the-counter contraceptives available — could help Republican candidates defuse the accusation that their party is out of touch on issues of importance to women and to show that they are willing to take a more pragmatic path.","26","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/opinion/thomas-b-edsall-the-republican-discovery-of-the-poor.html?_r=0"
"What should be most worrisome to Democrats is how far the Republican Party has traveled since issuing its self-critical post-2012 election report warning loyalists to stay off “scary” issues.

"The shift in the party’s attitude toward Israel stems from several factors, according to Republicans — a greater sense of solidarity in the fight against Islamic extremism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks increased support for the Jewish state among evangelical Christians and the influence of wealthy donors like Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate.

For instance, Democrats historically “own” education and health care, while Republicans are typically seen as better on crime and national security. Given that the G.O.P. has prioritized economic growth and opportunity over distributional concerns in recent decades, we would therefore expect concerns about inequality to be voiced primarily by Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, not Republicans.","124","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/upshot/why-republicans-are-suddenly-talking-about-economic-inequality.html?_r=0"

"Though Republicans’ shift in emphasis has drawn some derisive commentary, it’s worth examining why one party might choose to “trespass” into territory associated with the other. Such a move may be necessary to address an issue that the public sees as especially important and to minimize the damage it can cause to a disadvantaged candidate or party. In his first presidential campaign, for instance, Bill Clinton successfully portrayed himself as tough on crime, defusing a highly salient issue that had been seen as a weakness of Democrats such as the party’s 1988 presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis.","126","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/upshot/why-republicans-are-suddenly-talking-about-economic-inequality.html?_r=0"

"Another reason candidates trespass into the other party’s issues: They hope to be seen as less deficient in character traits associated with those issues. Research by the political scientist Danny Hayes finds in particular that “Republican candidates who can successfully portray themselves as at least as compassionate or empathetic as their opponents can turn a traditional Democratic advantage into an electoral asset.” George W. Bush, for instance, focused on the traditionally Democratic issue of education to bolster his credentials as a “compassionate” conservative. By contrast, the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, was unusually poorly regarded on character traits such as empathy — a possible consequence of criticism of his career at Bain Capital and a leaked video in which he described 47 percent of Americans as “dependent on government.”","129","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/upshot/why-republicans-are-suddenly-talking-about-economic-inequality.html?_r=0"

"But there is risk in issue-trespassing of the sort that the Republicans are attempting. One political science study found that the strategy is rarely successful and that voters tend to rely on party stereotypes instead — a conclusion that is reinforced by miscues like the infamous Dukakis tank ride.

"Unfortunately, good insurgent issues are hard to find. Inequality doesn’t look like a winner for Republicans in this election.

"To put together what it is calling the American Values Atlas, the institute divided survey respondents into more than a dozen faith-related categories, some of which factored racial identity into the equation as well.

"Among all Republicans, 35 percent favored the legalization of gay marriage, while 58 percent opposed it. But subtract the white evangelicals and the spread changes: 45 to 47.

"Just 39 percent of all Republicans said that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 58 percent said that it shouldn’t.

"In fact Republican voters who aren’t evangelical are probably even more socially liberal than those even-split numbers suggest, because the institute’s survey counted as Republican or Democrat only those respondents who readily identified themselves that way. It didn’t press others on whether they typically voted for one party, so the share of voters it categorized as independent was unusually large: 40 percent.

"With the 2016 campaign underway, and candidates positioning themselves for money, endorsements and staff, the establishment of the party is again at the center of the conversation. Even though Mr. Romney said on Friday that he had decided not to pursue the nomination, a third Bush seems poised to run, and has suggested he will not bow down to conservative activists.","306","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"

The answer is the blue-state Republicans.","307","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"The blue-state Republicans make it far harder for a very conservative candidate to win the party’s nomination than the party’s reputation suggests. They also give a candidate who might seem somewhat out of touch with today’s Republican Party, like Jeb Bush, a larger base of potential support than is commonly thought.","308","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"

"But the blue-state Republicans still possess the delegates, voters and resources to decide the nomination.

Mr. Romney won three times as many voters in overwhelmingly Democratic New York City than in Republican-leaning Alaska.","310","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"Overall, 59 percent of Romney voters in the Republican primaries lived in the states carried by President Obama.

"For all the legitimate attention that will be given to questions about whether an establishment favorite like Mr. Bush can win over deeply conservative voters, there are just as many questions about which conservative candidate can win over blue-state Republicans.

"“There’s no question the presidential trail goes through places that congressional Republicans don’t always have to go,” said Ari Fleischer, the first White House press secretary for George W. Bush, the last Republican to win the party’s nomination largely because of strength in red-state primaries. Mr. Bush struggled in blue states, losing early primaries in New Hampshire and Michigan, but still secured the nomination.","313","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"The importance of blue-state Republicans makes it far less likely that the party will nominate a conservative firebrand or a favorite of the religious right, like Ted Cruz or Mike Huckabee, than one might guess from the unwavering conservatism of the red-state electorates that hold sway over elected Republicans in Washington. It also makes the primaries the party’s best chance to moderate its image in hopes of faring better in presidential elections, as the Democrats did in 1992 by nominating Bill Clinton, a Southern Democrat. The pre-eminence of red-state conservative Republicans in Washington has made it all but impossible for congressional Republicans to compromise, moderate or rebrand the party ahead of the 2016 elections.","314","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"It would be hard for the Republicans to nominate a true moderate who disagreed with the party’s conservative base on more than a few issues. Most blue-state Republicans are conservatives, but they are nonetheless very different from their red-state counterparts. Moderate Republican politicians, like Mr. McCain or Mr. Romney, have been forced to evolve into more conservative candidates on issues like immigration or climate change. Yet Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney would have struggled to win the nomination without the blue-state Republicans.","315","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"The tendency of a national primary electorate to moderate a party isn’t new. And it’s not limited to the Republicans. Mr. Clinton won just three of the first 15 contests in 1992, losing relatively liberal Maryland, Colorado and New Hampshire before sweeping eight Southern primaries on Super Tuesday. Hillary Clinton would have a huge advantage over a candidate who challenged her from the left. Such a candidate might win San Francisco, Boulder, Colo., or Vermont, but would struggle to win relatively conservative Democrats in Appalachia or the South.","316","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"According to an analysis of Pew Research and exit-poll data, blue-state Republicans tend to be more urban, more moderate, less religious and more affluent. A majority of red-state Republicans are evangelical Christians, believe society should discourage homosexuality, think politicians should do what it takes to undermine the Affordable Care Act and want politicians to stand up for their positions, even if that means little gets done in Washington. A majority of blue-state Republicans differ on every count.","317","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"In recent presidential primaries, blue-state Republican voters have overwhelmingly supported so-called establishment candidates. On Super Tuesday in 2008, Mr. McCain all but locked up the nomination by winning delegate-rich blue states like Illinois, New York, California and New Jersey. Yet outside of his home state, he lost nine of the 11 red-state contests on that night. Mr. Romney lost all but one red-state primary held before his principal opponent dropped out of the race, yet he won the nomination by sweeping the blue states. He won 45 percent of the vote in blue-state primaries, but just 30 percent in the states that voted for him in the general election.","318","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"A credible conservative threat to whoever emerges as the Republican’s leading establishment candidate is likely to be posed by a candidate who can break the establishment candidate’s grip on the blue states. They would combine strong red-state appeal with at least modest blue-state support — more than Rick Santorum won in 2012 or than Mr. Huckabee did in 2008. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has won elections in a blue state but who also appeals to grass-roots conservatives, is one possibility.","319","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"Here’s another way to think about it: If the Republican presidential nominee were decided by the red states — by the same electorates that send Republican officials to Washington and then dissuade them from even the most incremental compromises — then Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain probably wouldn’t have won the party’s nomination. Mr. Romney would have won a below-average share of the vote in 154 of the 247 districts represented by Republicans, as well as the states that contribute 38 of the 54 Republican senators, according to an Upshot model of Mr. Romney’s support in the 2012 primaries.","320","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"THE clout of blue-state Republicans is enhanced by an alliance with the party’s donor class. Republican donors, in general, are likely more concerned by electability and business issues than religiosity and the culture wars. But they also come disproportionately from the blue states, which accounted for 62 percent of all Republican primary fund-raising in 2012. A candidate like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey or the former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 2008 might be too moderate to win the nomination, but would have a far easier time raising money than a highly conservative candidate like Mr. Santorum.","321","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"The distance between the base of congressional Republicans and the more geographically diverse primary voters is far larger than it used to be. Heading into the 1992 presidential election, the Republican Senate was split nearly evenly — 55 to 45 percent — between senators from today’s red and blue states. Now the split is 81 to 19. That’s because the ranks of red-state Republicans grew enormously in 1994, 2010 and 2014, while blue-state Republicans suffered big losses in 2006, 2008 and even 2012. The share of Republican voters from the Obama states, meanwhile, has barely decreased at all.","322","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"The importance of the blue states doesn’t mean that a conservative to the right of the party’s center couldn’t win the nomination. Brad Todd, a Republican strategist, thinks that the support for Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain in the blue states was a product of the weak candidates they faced, not because the blue states were unwilling to support populist, conservative candidates. Some blue states, like Colorado or Nevada, might even contain primary voters who are “more conservative than in some red states,” he added.","323","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"A populist, conservative candidate has won the blue states before. George W. Bush was conservative, populist and evangelical, but also a Harvard M.B.A. and a scion of the establishment. He lost Manhattan, San Francisco and Alexandria, Va., but still managed to win the New York, California and Virginia primaries — along with the nomination. Mr. Walker, an evangelical Christian who rose to prominence by fighting labor unions, making him a demonstrated ally of the business wing of the party, has a similar profile with the potential to appeal to voters throughout the party.","324","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"
"The red-state Republicans aren’t standing around. The Georgia secretary of state, Brian Kemp, is organizing a so-called SEC primary — referring to the college sports conference — of Southern states on March 1, the first date when states other than Iowa, South Carolina, Nevada and New Hampshire are permitted to hold contests. The potential effect is obvious: It could bestow crucial momentum to the candidate favored by the South, perhaps another conservative like Mr. Santorum or Mr. Huckabee, and the boost needed to win the Midwestern primaries where conservative candidates have struggled, like Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. Even in that scenario, the conservative Republican would need to win in the blue states — and would hope to have an easier time doing so after red-state victories.","325","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-surprising-power-of-blue-state-republicans.html?_r=0"

"It would certainly weaken food safety. For example, more than 90 percent of our seafood is imported, a figure that includes fish that were caught domestically and sent overseas for processing before coming back in, which makes the inspection process even more complicated. All told, that’s more than five billion pounds of imports annually, and according to the Center for Food Safety, just 90 federal inspectors guarantee its safety. (The Food and Drug Administration inspects less than 2 percent of imported seafood.) By reducing restrictions on Southeast Asian imports, the TPP would allow more fish containing chemicals that are illegal in domestic aquaculture to reach our shores; by making inspections less effective, it would virtually guarantee that those chemicals make it to our tables.","403","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/opinion/obama-and-republicans-agree-on-the-trans-pacific-partnership-unfortunately.html?_r=0"

"In fact, if you wanted to single out a culprit for income stagnation and the decline of the power of labor in the United States, Nafta would be a good candidate. It allowed large corporations to move where tax breaks were best and environmental regulations weakest, while forcing labor to compete against lower global wages.

Meanwhile, imports of American corn (a basic staple in the form of tortillas for 5,000 years), increased fourfold. Imports of wheat, rice, cotton and soybeans have increased similarly. In brief, Mexican farmers have gone to work for transnational companies, whether in Mexico, the United States or elsewhere. Nor did this do much good for farmers to the north, who have seen corn prices fluctuate wildly, leaving them to scramble to maximize yields, which in turn causes environmental damage.","409","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/opinion/obama-and-republicans-agree-on-the-trans-pacific-partnership-unfortunately.html?_r=0"

"No one expects the Republicans who control Congress to take him up on his invitation. Any attempts to thicken the social safety net through government spending are philosophically inimical to the G.O.P. point of view.

"Last week, I wrote to all 100 Senate offices and asked how they individually handled parental leave. While only 26 replied (not surprising, really; it meant voluntarily laying bare their private policies, always a touchy subject), it’s worth noting that virtually all of the respondents — 15 Democrats, two independents and nine Republicans — said they provided paid leave of some kind. What this means, practically speaking, is that all of them go above and beyond what the Family and Medical Leave Act requires — 12 weeks of unpaid leave, assuming both employee and employer meet the requirements.","776","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"

"Marco Rubio, the conservative presidential hopeful from Florida, gives his staff as much paid maternity and paternity leave (12 and six weeks, respectively) as Bernie Sanders, who started his career as an “unabashed socialist” in Vermont and went on to co-found the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The Republican Mike Enzi, who successfully beat back a primary challenge from Liz Cheney in Wyoming last year, gives six weeks of paid maternity leave, which is identical to the policy of Dianne Feinstein, once the mayor of highly liberal San Francisco.

The Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the HELP Committee (Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) gives 12 paid weeks of maternity leave, which is just a tad more than the Delaware Democrat Chris Coons, who offers 10.

"One might expect this from Democrats, who, as a matter of principle, believe that governments have an obligation to care for their citizenry when the free market fails to do so. But it’s more surprising from Republicans, who generally speaking, do not. The question is, why?","781","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"
"I put this question to Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, who offers six weeks of paid parental leave (and an extra two for the mother if there are complications during pregnancy). Her position is that there’s a difference between the government’s requesting that employers do something and requiring that they do it. In her office’s case, she says that yes, she decided to set aside money for paid leave, but “it means making cuts elsewhere — cutting the number of people we hire over all, or the travel my staff is able to do.” When it comes to the private sector, she says, “it’s up to businesses to make that decision.”","782","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"
"And this belief is perfectly respectable as far as it goes. The problem is that we, as a nation, have been running this experiment for decades now, and the verdict is clear: Without government assistance — or nudging — most businesses will never feel the obligation to pay for family leave on their own. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 11 percent of private-sector workers got paid family leave in 2012. As Mr. Obama noted this summer, “many women can’t even get a paid day off to give birth.”","783","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"
"Ms. Fischer has attempted to provide a bipartisan solution to this problem by co-authoring a bill with Angus King, a Maine Independent who caucuses with Democrats, that would provide tax credits to businesses offering families paid leave. This notion is surely more palatable to the Republican-led Congress than Mr. Obama’s initiative, which involves $2.2 billion in spending. But Ms. Fischer frankly concedes that she doesn’t expect Congress to entertain their bill this session.","784","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"
"Yet there’s a solid case to be made that paid family leave is good for business. Three years ago, Rutgers’ Center for Women and Work issued a report showing that women who took paid leave were far more likely to be working for the same employer a year later. It also added that women and men who returned to work after paid leave were far less likely to collect food stamps or public assistance in the year following their child’s birth. As Ms. Fischer herself says, family leave also helps people on her staff “do their job well. They’re not preoccupied, they’re not worrying about everything that’s happening at home when they’re at work.”","785","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"
"IT’S already a cliché to point out that the United States is the sole industrialized nation without a paid maternity leave policy. (In case you’re wondering what we have in common with Papua New Guinea, this is it.) According to a Pew study last April, our inability to provide affordable child care as a nation may help explain our declining rates in women’s participation in the work force.","786","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"
"Absent state funding and intervention on this matter, it falls to individual families — small, fragile, closed little loops of two parents (if that) — to resolve what the state and the private sector do not. It’s utterly exhausting to them. It means a scarcity economy at home, with spouses quarreling about whose career is more important and whose time is more valuable. Someone almost inevitably needs to scale back ambitions or earning power in order to make life work.","787","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"
"And that someone, usually, is the mom. Which brings me to this final plea: Even the most enlightened Senate offices — and private-sector offices — seem to believe that fathers require fewer weeks of leave than mothers. Mr. Obama himself referred to “maternity leave” in his State of the Union address, not “parental leave,” as he had in previous statements. There are hundreds of arguments to make in favor of parity between the sexes when it comes to family leave. (High among them: More engaged dads allow their wives to lean in; more and more gay men are having kids, and shouldn’t be subjected to different rules.) But here, I’m going to name a very modest reason: It would make things more tranquil at home. Over and over again in my research, I hear mothers of newborns say, “When my husband comes home from work, he wants to comfort the baby, but he can’t, because the baby is used to me.” And then the fights begin. Because Mom is tired. Mom wants a break.","788","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"
"I doubt mothers would be hearing such things if fathers took equal time off from the get-go — paid or unpaid. Couples would be dividing child care and the domestic tasks more equitably (at present, mothers do nearly twice as much of both); they would also have two expert hands on deck. Their marriages would be stronger. And they’d have the Republican Congress to thank.","789","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/generous-republican-benefits.html?_r=0"

"Today’s conservatives are apprehensive about Pope Francis, who has changed the tone and culture, not the doctrines, of the Roman Catholic Church in less than two years as pontiff. He stresses, with passion and authenticity, a commitment to addressing poverty and income inequality more than the social issues that have dominated much of the Catholic debate in America.","1287","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html?_r=0"
"John Carr, a former top official of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, notes that Francis’ message on abortion is “no obsession, no retreat.” The pope helped broker the recent thaw in American-Cuban relations, to the consternation of conservatives such as the Florida senator Marco Rubio. Francis now is determined to make addressing climate change a moral imperative for the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics.","1288","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html?_r=0"
"This doesn’t mean that Francis is the poster pope for liberal Democrats: “He’s challenging everybody,” said Mr. Carr, now director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University. “Most Democrats haven’t been talking about poverty.” He suggested that Francis’ impact is starting to change the conversation among Democrats, along with some conservative Republicans, such as the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.","1289","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html?_r=0"
"Still, Francis’ message is unsettling to more than a few conservatives, particularly his focus on climate change and his initiatives to influence the United Nations’ conference in Paris this year. Some prominent Republicans, such as the Senate Environment Committee chairman, James Inhofe, are climate-change deniers.","1290","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html?_r=0"
"Some Catholic business leaders have complained about Francis’ emphasis on income inequality and the defects of capitalism. Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire co-founder of the Home Depot and a major Republican donor, warned Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York that if the pope kept up the drumbeat, some wealthy Catholics might stop giving to church causes. (“Liberals say popes don’t know anything about sex, conservatives say they don’t know anything about economics,” Mr. Carr observed.) And Francis has rattled the United States church hierarchy, notably the bishops.","1291","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html?_r=0"
"American church leaders have long been advocates for the poor and for immigrants. But these are edicts many conservatives felt could be ignored; the focus and priorities were the social issues, led by hard-line prelates such as Cardinal Raymond Burke, the former archbishop of St. Louis, who refused communion to any Catholic politicians who weren’t on the right side of the abortion issue.","1292","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html?_r=0"
"Francis removed Cardinal Burke as head of the Vatican’s high court. The cardinal, a Francis critic, recently asserted that a “feminized” church, which permits altar girls, is responsible for a shortage of priests and some of the pedophilia crimes. Equally important, the pope chose Blase J. Cupich, the progressive bishop of Spokane, Wash., to be the archbishop of Chicago, the third-largest American diocese. He succeeds Cardinal Francis George, a conservative cultural warrior.","1293","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html?_r=0"

"The pope is set to visit the United States in September. He’ll go to Philadelphia and New York and probably Washington.

"Many Republicans have no fondness for net neutrality — the idea that cable and phone companies should treat all information equally as it travels over their broadband Internet networks.

"Republicans and large telecommunications companies are natural allies in opposing government regulations. Now, two Republican lawmakers, Senator John Thune of South Dakota and Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, have proposed a bill that they claim would achieve neutrality on the Internet without the kind of regulation the F.C.C. is expected to approve next month. But the legislation has such large loopholes that powerful cable and phone companies like Comcast and Verizon would feel almost no effect.","1338","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/opinion/republicans-try-to-pre-empt-the-fcc.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Thune and Mr. Upton say their bill would forbid the cable and phone companies from giving preference to traffic from certain businesses, like Amazon and Google, that are willing to pay more for faster delivery, which would hurt smaller companies. The legislation would also prohibit such companies from blocking or slowing downloads from certain sites.","1339","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/opinion/republicans-try-to-pre-empt-the-fcc.html?_r=0"
"Those are excellent goals, but there is a giant caveat in the bill: Companies would be allowed to offer “specialized services” that would not be subject to any of those rules.

"The bill would also prohibit the F.C.C. from classifying broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service, something the commission has been moving closer to in recent months. Courts have ruled that the commission now has limited authority to regulate broadband, but the telecommunications designation — which already applies to home phone lines and cellphone service — would give the commission the authority it needs to prohibit companies from engaging in unfair and unreasonable business practices. The chairman of the F.C.C., Tom Wheeler, recently suggested that the agency would vote on Feb. 26 to reclassify broadband.","1341","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/opinion/republicans-try-to-pre-empt-the-fcc.html?_r=0"
"The good news is that even if Republicans in Congress, who receive big donations from telecommunications companies, can push through Mr. Thune’s and Mr. Upton’s legislation, President Obama would almost surely veto it. In November, the president called on the F.C.C. to reclassify broadband. But Republicans could try to get the proposal through by attaching it to unrelated bills the president would find difficult to veto.

"Once a winning primary issue as well as a powerful wedge issue wielded against Democrats, opposing same-sex marriage has grown far more complicated for Republicans.

"Mr. Bolger said that even if the court ended up not finding in favor of same-sex marriage, the sweep of change would continue. “Given the generation gap on this issue, even if the courts rule against same-sex marriage, it’s only going to be a matter of time before this changes: Opponents of same-sex marriage are dying a lot faster than supporters are because opponents are older,” he said.","1363","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/us/politics/gop-struggling-with-shifts-on-gay-marriage.html?_r=0"

"The issue in question is the future of Social Security, which turned 80 last week. The retirement program is, of course, both extremely popular and a long-term target of conservatives, who want to kill it precisely because its popularity helps legitimize government action in general. As the right-wing activist Stephen Moore (now chief economist of the Heritage Foundation) once declared, Social Security is “the soft underbelly of the welfare state”; “jab your spear through that” and you can undermine the whole thing.","1543","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/opinion/republicans-against-retirement.html?_r=0"
"But that was a decade ago, during former President George W. Bush’s attempt to privatize the program — and what Mr. Bush learned was that the underbelly wasn’t that soft after all. Despite the political momentum coming from the G.O.P.’s victory in the 2004 election, despite support from much of the media establishment, the assault on Social Security quickly crashed and burned. Voters, it turns out, like Social Security as it is, and don’t want it cut.","1544","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/opinion/republicans-against-retirement.html?_r=0"
"It’s remarkable, then, that most of the Republicans who would be president seem to be lining up for another round of punishment.

"Thus, Jeb Bush says that the retirement age should be pushed back to “68 or 70”. Scott Walker has echoed that position. Marco Rubio wants both to raise the retirement age and to cut benefits for higher-income seniors. Rand Paul wants to raise the retirement age to 70 and means-test benefits. Ted Cruz wants to revive the Bush privatization plan.","1546","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/opinion/republicans-against-retirement.html?_r=0"
"For the record, these proposals would be really bad public policy — a harsh blow to Americans in the bottom half of the income distribution, who depend on Social Security, often have jobs that involve manual labor, and have not, in fact, seen a big rise in life expectancy.

"Still, nobody should be surprised at the spectacle of politicians enthusiastically endorsing destructive policies. What’s puzzling about the renewed Republican assault on Social Security is that it looks like bad politics as well as bad policy.

"Wealthy individuals have long played a disproportionate role in politics, but we’ve never seen anything like what’s happening now: domination of campaign finance, especially on the Republican side, by a tiny group of immensely wealthy donors.

"And while most Americans love Social Security, the wealthy don’t. Two years ago a pioneering study of the policy preferences of the very wealthy found many contrasts with the views of the general public; as you might expect, the rich are politically different from you and me. But nowhere are they as different as they are on the matter of Social Security. By a very wide margin, ordinary Americans want to see Social Security expanded. But by an even wider margin, Americans in the top 1 percent want to see it cut. And guess whose preferences are prevailing among Republican candidates.","1552","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/opinion/republicans-against-retirement.html?_r=0"
"You often see political analyses pointing out, rightly, that voting in actual primaries is preceded by an “invisible primary” in which candidates compete for the support of crucial elites. But who are these elites? In the past, it might have been members of the political establishment and other opinion leaders. But what the new attack on Social Security tells us is that the rules have changed. Nowadays, at least on the Republican side, the invisible primary has been reduced to a stark competition for the affections and, of course, the money of a few dozen plutocrats.","1553","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/opinion/republicans-against-retirement.html?_r=0"
"What this means, in turn, is that the eventual Republican nominee — assuming that it’s not Mr. Trump —will be committed not just to a renewed attack on Social Security but to a broader plutocratic agenda.

"In 2012, Mitt Romney made a promise that would come back to haunt him: that he could cut federal income tax rates by 20 percent across the board; eliminate enough tax deductions and credits to do this without increasing the deficit; and not raise taxes on people making less than $200,000.","MAY 19, 2015","1994","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"
"The problem for Mr. Romney was that the math didn’t work. Popular wisdom holds that the income tax code is full of deductions for the wealthy, but as of 2012, people making over $200,000 took deductions equal to just 15.7 percent of their adjusted gross income. As a result, there wasn’t enough money to balance Mr. Romney’s proposed tax cuts just by curtailing high earners’ deductions.","1995","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Romney released the tax plan in February 2012 to help himself in the Republican primary, in which several of his opponents were running on deep tax-cut plans. The plan was less helpful in the general election, when President Obama accused Mr. Romney of proposing to cut taxes on the rich at the expense of the middle class.","1996","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"
"There are a few ways the 2016 Republican candidates can avoid the Romney middle-class tax trap. They can break with party tradition and abandon the position that there should be significant tax-rate cuts for top earners. They can forthrightly defend the idea that people with low and middle incomes should pay more. They can abandon the promise of revenue neutrality — so a tax cut for the rich does not need to be offset by tax increases elsewhere. They can be as vague as possible.","1997","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"

"Five candidates or potential candidates have backed flat taxes: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Ben Carson have called for them in the current campaign, and Rick Perry supported one in 2012. Mike Huckabee ran for president in 2008 as an advocate of a single-rate sales tax to replace the income tax. In general, these candidates have floated rates in the teens, though Mr. Carson has said he might set a rate as low as 10 percent.","1999","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"
"What would a flat tax mean for the middle class? That depends what deductions are allowed. A flat tax could be devised to give a tax cut to many middle-income households through a large personal exemption, even if they currently pay an effective tax rate lower than the proposed single rate.","2000","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"
"However, a single-rate tax under 20 percent will necessarily mean a large tax cut for people with high incomes, since the current top federal income tax rate is 39.6 percent on married couples earning over $464,850. Such a tax must do one of two things: raise the tax burden on the middle class (for example, by offering a very limited personal exemption) or significantly reduce the overall tax collected by the federal government.","2001","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/upshot/can-republicans-avoid-the-romney-tax-trap.html?_r=0"
"In general, flat-tax proponents try to elide this problem. But Mr. Carson has been open about the fact that his plan would raise taxes on some lower earners.

"While flat taxes have long been a favorite of the conservative wing of the Republican party, establishment candidates have preferred to tinker with the existing system of graduated tax rates so as not to raise anybody’s taxes.

"But President Bush did so when the federal budget looked flush and it was politically possible to offer a deficit-increasing tax cut.

"Gov. Chris Christie, who is not yet a candidate but sometimes acts like one, gave a speech in New Hampshire last week in which he called for a tax plan similar to the one Mr. Romney ran on three years ago.

"Mr. Christie eased off Mr. Romney’s revenue neutrality pledge, saying his plan would not “materially increase the deficit” after combining with other measures.

"Ted Cruz: He noted his just-announced tax plan involves “the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has.” That’s true: his plan calls for a 10 percent flat personal income tax rate. But that’s not where his plan gets most of its tax revenue.","2576","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"The biggest tax in his plan is a 16 percent value added tax. Mr. Cruz describes this tax as a “business flat tax,” but it’s not a tax on business profits. Businesses would pay the tax on their total sales, minus the cost of the things they bought to produce the thing they sold. They would not be able to deduct wages, meaning they would pay the 16 percent tax on an amount far greater than their profits. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates this tax would generate $25 trillion in revenue over a decade, making it about six times bigger than the existing corporate income tax, which Mr. Cruz would repeal, and more than twice as big as his proposed personal income tax.","2577","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"Added up across the whole economy, Mr. Cruz’s VAT would be equivalent to a very broadly based sales tax, applying even to services like health care that are ordinarily exempt from sales taxes. Like a sales tax, this tax would be built into prices and paid by consumers — and for many lower-income households, it would be a far greater burden than the income tax.","2578","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"Basically, the Cruz plan is a large VAT with a small income tax on top. His plan is very similar to Rand Paul’s tax plan, which I wrote about in June. Both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Paul have chosen to identify their VATs as “business” taxes, obscuring the fact that consumers would ultimately pay it. The main difference is that Mr. Paul leans a little more on income tax and Mr. Cruz leans a little more on the VAT.","2579","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"Marco Rubio: John Harwood, of CNBC and The New York Times, asked Senator Rubio why his plan offers bigger tax breaks to people with high incomes than to people with moderate incomes. Mr. Rubio responded: “No, that’s — you’re wrong. In fact, the largest after-tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.” You might notice Mr. Rubio’s comment was not directly responsive to Mr. Harwood’s question: He asked about the difference between middle and high earners, not between low and high earners.","2580","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"The truth is that the Rubio plan offers the largest percentage increases in after-tax income to low earners, then the highest earners, with the smallest improvements for moderate earners — that is, both Mr. Rubio’s answer and Mr. Harwood’s question were correct. And this actually reflects a distinct feature of Mr. Rubio’s tax plan: While all the Republican tax plans, including his, are generous to the highest earners, his plan is more focused on raising incomes for the poor and less on cutting taxes for the middle class.","2581","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"According to an analysis from the Tax Foundation (as developed with Senator Mike Lee and released in March), Mr. Rubio’s plan would raise after-tax incomes for the bottom 10 percent of earners by a whopping 44.2 percent, mostly by expanding tax credits so their tax bills would be negative. (Remember, these people have low incomes, so the absolute amounts being discussed here are often small.) It would raise after-tax incomes for the highest 10 percent of earners by 5.5 percent, and the top 1 percent of earners by 11.2 percent. Families earning from 40 to 90 percent of the average would get smaller tax cuts, increasing their incomes by 1 to 3 percent.","2582","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"There is one caveat to all that generosity for low-income filers, though: Senator Rubio and Senator Lee have not yet hammered out precisely which low-income filers would qualify for their new, generous tax credits.","2583","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"“Our offices would negotiate rules and requirements for eligibility of the refundable credit,” said Brooke Sammon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Rubio’s campaign. “Rules would be tailored to ensure that our reforms would not create payments for new, nonworking filers.” She confirmed the credit would be refundable — that is, whatever the eventual rules say, at least some low-income taxpayers would qualify for a credit so large they’d get a negative tax bill. The Tax Foundation assumed all existing tax filers would qualify for a full refund of the credit, but people who currently do not file a tax return would not qualify. If Mr. Rubio ends up setting out more restrictive rules than that, his plan would be less generous to the poor than the Tax Foundation estimates indicate.","2584","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"Those calculations are just the direct effects from tax law changes. The Tax Foundation says everyone would actually do better than that because Mr. Rubio’s plan would fuel economic growth that would cause pretax incomes to soar. They even say it would cause the economy to grow so rapidly that tax revenues a decade after his tax cuts would be higher than if he hadn’t cut taxes at all. Unfortunately, as I reported in March, the Tax Foundation relies on assumptions about tax effects on business investment that are well outside the consensus among economists — both conservative and liberal economists called their forecast unrealistic.","2585","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Rubio’s plan would greatly increase the budget deficit, unless offset by sharp federal government spending cuts that would have their own impacts on families’ well-being. You’d have to weigh those against the benefits of tax cuts. If these tax cuts were simply financed with government borrowing like the last round of Republican tax cuts, economists would generally expect that borrowing to slow economic growth, offsetting positive growth effects from the tax cuts themselves.","2586","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"Ben Carson: Becky Quick, one of the moderators, asked how he planned to finance the government with a 10 percent tax based on tithing, even though that would bring in less than half as much revenue as the federal government collects today.","2587","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Carson disclaimed that idea. “Well, first of all, I didn’t say that the rate would be 10 percent,” he told Ms. Quick. Well, actually, he did. At the first Republican debate, he described the plan as follows: “You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one.” But anyway, Mr. Carson now doesn’t think a 10 percent rate is workable, and said the rate would have to be closer to 15 percent.","2588","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"

"Essentially, he’s saying, if the base is broad enough, a 15 percent tax will suffice. The main problem is his assumption that you can have a tax with a base equal to 100 percent of the economy. Some things are always tax exempt, for a mixture of good reasons and bad. We don’t tax investment income earned by nonprofits like churches and universities, nor do we tax investment returns to pension funds and 401(k) retirement accounts. We don’t tax income that people give away to charity. We don’t tax employee health benefits. Most tax plans decline to tax at least some income for low earners; Mr. Cruz said his flat tax wouldn’t apply to the first $36,000 of income for a family of four.","2590","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"

"John Kasich: Mr. Kasich attacked his opponents for “tax schemes that don’t add up” and particularly criticized Mr. Carson for his “tithe” plan. He positioned himself as the “realistic” candidate.

Despite high projected budget deficits, Mr. Kasich says he can cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent from 39.6 percent, the top capital gains tax rate to 15 percent from 23.8 percent, and the corporate income tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent — and still balance the budget in eight years.","2592","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/upshot/fact-checking-republicans-on-tax-plans.html?_r=0"

Ted Cruz demands a return to the gold standard. Jeb Bush says he isn’t sure about that, but is open to the idea.

"As I said, this hard-money orthodoxy is relatively new.

"Crime rates are down substantially from historical highs, and it currently ranks very low on the list of the problems the public considers most important. However, crime was previously a highly salient issue that the public perceived Republicans as better able to handle.

"These Republican attacks could also be politically damaging to Democrats because of the unavoidable racial connotations. The United States has a long history of politicians who play to the fears of white voters with claims of threats to public safety from crime and protest movements (including, most recently, Mr. Trump, who asserted a dubious link between illegal immigration from Mexico and violent crime). Such fears are likely to be strengthened if Republicans invoke Mr. Obama, whose very identity, studies show, can further polarize Americans along racial lines.","2616","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/upshot/will-crime-return-as-an-election-strategy-for-republicans.html?_r=0"

Yet Mr. Trump and another candidate, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, inveighed against what they called amnesty and argued that undocumented workers were driving down Americans’ wages.","2648","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"The splintering over immigration, in a campaign dominated so far by the personas, speeches and backgrounds of the candidates, illuminated the brightest dividing line between Republican hopefuls like Mr. Bush and Mr. Kasich, who favor a comprehensive immigration overhaul, and the many primary voters who have embraced Mr. Trump’s harsh language about immigrants in the country illegally.","2649","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"While several other candidates, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, received a pass from the moderators on immigration, Mr. Kasich took on the issue directly after Mr. Trump defended his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and to identify and deport some 11 million people.","2650","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"“Think about the families; think about the children,” Mr. Kasich said. “Come on, folks, we know you can’t pick them up and ship them across the border. It’s a silly argument. It’s not an adult argument.”","2651","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Trump, whose counterpunches were a memorable part of his early debate performances, replied coolly at first, citing President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s approach to deporting immigrants in the 1950s.","2652","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Bush then tried to pounce. He twitted Mr. Trump, his longtime rival in the race, for suggesting that Mr. Bush be allowed to speak — “What a generous man you are” — and warned that Mr. Trump’s harsh proposals would drive Hispanic voters to support the Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.","2655","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"

"But policy details and disagreements, for the most part, replaced nasty potshots in the early going on Tuesday night, laying bare real fissures within the Republican Party on immigration, national security, trade and the meaning of being a conservative. The candidates used the 90 seconds they were allotted for each answer to promote their tax proposals, to lament what they said were intrusive business regulations and to delve into the country’s monetary policy. Even when Mr. Kasich sought to speak at one point when he was not called on, it was because he wanted to discuss a value-added tax.","2657","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Rubio was not only able to avoid being drawn into the contentious immigration debate, but also repeatedly received questions that allowed him to answer with versions of his stump speech. Even he seemed unable to believe his good fortune when he was asked to make his case against Mrs. Clinton.

"Less than three months before Iowa begins the Republican nominating contest, the jostling in Milwaukee reflected the growing urgency the candidates feel to stand out in a sprawling 14-person field. With a pair of political novices, Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson, atop the polls, the other candidates appeared determined to remain in the campaign until there is more clarity on who is likely to be the nominee. But the muddled picture is clearly starting to unnerve many in the party.","2660","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"

"They barely explored recent controversies roiling the Republican race, particularly accusations that Mr. Carson had embellished or even fabricated part of his inspiring life story.

"“The fact of the matter is, we should vet all candidates,” Mr. Carson said. “I have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about.” He then accused Mrs. Clinton of initially lying about the motives of the terrorists who killed four State Department employees in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, and charged that the news media had not held her accountable. As for himself, he said, “People who know me know that I’m an honest person.”","2663","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Rubio, who delivered the strongest performance in the October debate, has been struggling since then to put to rest questions about his personal finances, with the Bush campaign and Mr. Trump portraying him as irresponsible.

"Mr. Bush, who clashed memorably with Mr. Rubio in the debate last month, strained Tuesday to show skeptical donors and voters that his campaign is still viable, ignoring Mr. Rubio and instead repeatedly attacking Mrs. Clinton on fiscal issues.","2665","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"

"Several other candidates also focused more on Mrs. Clinton than on their rivals. Mr. Kasich, who had declined to attack her in the first months of his campaign, joined in, saying, “It will be a disaster if she got elected.”","2667","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"

"Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who had perhaps the best night of his campaign, delivered a sophisticated explanation of his libertarian-leaning views on foreign policy. And he made a forceful case about conservatism, portraying Mr. Rubio as a big spender who would not adhere to small-government values.","2669","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"“Marco, how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure for the government that you’re not paying for?” Mr. Paul asked, citing Mr. Rubio’s proposals for higher military spending.","2670","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"

"“I know that the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power in the world,” Mr. Rubio said.","2672","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Paul did not relent in the face of the applause, responding, “I don’t think we’re any safer from bankruptcy court,” and asking Mr. Rubio how he could be “a conservative and be liberal on military spending.”","2673","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Trump expounded on views that placed him outside of mainstream thinking for many independent and swing voters, not only on immigration but also in his fierce opposition to increasing the minimum wage; he said that wages were too high.","2674","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"The debate was also a prime opportunity for the Republicans to distinguish themselves as economic thinkers with new ideas to create jobs or lower the national debt, $18 trillion and counting. But few of them left powerful impressions. Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson staked out their opposition to a $15 minimum wage but offered no new proposals to help poor and working-class people. Mr. Rubio agreed with them on the minimum wage but argued that higher education and vocational training must become more accessible and be aimed specifically at increasing wages.","2675","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"

"Mr. Kasich noted that his state, Ohio, had increased the minimum wage and said that “people need help.” He cited his plan to cut personal and corporate taxes and achieve a balanced federal budget by 2024.","2677","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"

"Sensing an opening to appeal to the party’s conservative grass roots after Mr. Kasich and Mr. Bush attacked Mr. Trump for his hard-line stance on immigration, Mr. Cruz uncorked an assault on his party and the news media.","2679","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"Picking up on Mr. Bush’s comment about Mrs. Clinton’s campaign exchanging “high-fives” over the Republican discussion of immigration, Mr. Cruz said Democrats were actually laughing. “If the Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose,” he said.","2680","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Cruz suggested donors were tone-deaf on the issue because they did not appreciate the economic impact of what he said was illegal immigrants’ pushing down American wages. “The politics of it would be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande,” he said, adding that the news coverage would also differ if undocumented immigrants were seeking journalism jobs.","2681","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"

"After the early exchanges on immigration, Mr. Trump seemed to struggle in a debate focused largely on policy substance. He was not helped by an audience that booed him when he criticized Carly Fiorina for trying to cut off Mr. Paul’s answer on a foreign policy question. “Why does she keep interrupting everybody?” Mr. Trump asked. Moments later, audience members chuckled when he boasted about being “stable mates” with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when they appeared on the same episode of “60 Minutes.”","2684","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/republican-debate-fox-business.html?_r=0"
"Ms. Fiorina, who has slipped after a strong performance in the September debate, sought to revive herself with a story about a woman she met on the campaign trail who expressed concern for her children’s future.

"“As I look at the race, historically, there have been two major lanes in the Republican primary,” Mr. Cruz said last week. “There’s been a moderate lane and a conservative lane.” Unsurprisingly, Mr. Cruz thinks he’ll outlast Ben Carson and Donald Trump to emerge as the winner of the “conservative lane,” and then triumph over whoever wins on the “moderate” side, either Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush.","2855","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/upshot/how-many-lanes-do-the-republicans-really-have.html?_r=0"
"But these lanes typically have not been nearly so clear. In the last two Republican contests, for instance, there were two relatively conservative candidates who won states on Super Tuesday: Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee were both positioned to the right of John McCain in 2008, while Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum found themselves in a similar position in 2012.","2856","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/upshot/how-many-lanes-do-the-republicans-really-have.html?_r=0"
"How were so many candidates in the “conservative lane”? Well, because the “conservative lane” isn’t nearly as defined as it looks. The various factions of the conservative wing of the Republican Party are quite diverse, and they don’t necessarily agree. There’s the religious right, the populists, the libertarians and a secular “very conservative” wing.","2857","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/upshot/how-many-lanes-do-the-republicans-really-have.html?_r=0"
"In both 2008 and 2012, the religious right ultimately supported a socially conservative candidate who won Iowa: Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee. But a large number of more secular and affluent conservatives sided with Mr. Romney in 2008 and Mr. Gingrich in 2012. Contrary to popular belief, there isn’t much evidence that these voters would have preferred the candidate of the religious right to the establishment or moderate-backed candidate.","2858","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/upshot/how-many-lanes-do-the-republicans-really-have.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Cruz might have a similar problem this year. The diversity of the conservative lane makes it much easier to imagine how Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump could stay strong for a long time. They have the name recognition, resources and political appeal necessary to hold on to their bases all the way through Iowa. They have distinct bases of support that might not be as vulnerable to split to Mr. Cruz as it looks.","2859","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/upshot/how-many-lanes-do-the-republicans-really-have.html?_r=0"
"According to polls, Mr. Cruz does well among voters who describe themselves as very conservative. But Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump have very different appeal, including to many voters who identify themselves as moderate. In fact, Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump lead among self-described moderates by a wide margin, typically with more than 20 percent of the vote.","2860","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/upshot/how-many-lanes-do-the-republicans-really-have.html?_r=0"

"Of a dozen Iowa Republicans interviewed after the debate who were undecided going into it, representing diverse corners of the state and walks of life, none said Mr. Trump had improved his chances of winning their vote.

"In Tuesday’s Republican presidential debate, Senator Ted Cruz reintroduced an idea that had many viewers scratching their heads and nearly all economists pulling out their hair. Mr. Cruz advocated a return to the gold standard — that is, tying the value of a dollar to a set amount of gold — because, he said, it produced prosperity under the Bretton Woods system and it helped “workingmen and -women.”","NOV. 13, 2015","2908","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Cruz is confused about history and economics. The framers of Bretton Woods specifically designed their new international monetary system not to be a gold standard because they believed gold-based currency was largely responsible for the Great Depression. Their system, named for the New Hampshire town hosting the 1944 international conference that created it, was not a gold standard but “the exact opposite,” according to John Maynard Keynes, one of the system’s principal designers. Under Bretton Woods, nations were not obliged to set monetary policy according to how much gold they had, but rather according to their economic needs.","2909","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"
"Leaving his historical errors aside, Mr. Cruz is not the only Republican presidential candidate to express admiration for the gold standard: Senator Rand Paul and Ben Carson have, too. The gold standard has long been a pet cause among some conservatives (it was hinted at in the 2012 Republican platform) and has gained credence among mainstream Republicans as a tool to limit government influence over the economy.","2910","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"
"But a return to the gold standard would be catastrophic, especially as we continue the climb out of our Great Recession. That is because, as the framers of Bretton Woods knew, the course of an economy depends not only on what happens, but on what people expect will happen.","2911","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"
"Under a gold standard, the amount of gold a nation holds in bank vaults determines how much of its money circulates. If a nation’s gold stock increases through trade, for example, the country issues more currency. Likewise, if its gold stock decreases, it issues less.","2912","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"
"Gold as currency has obvious problems. First, there is relatively little of it while there are more people and goods all the time. So in the long term, the gold standard exerts a downward pressure on prices as money becomes relatively tighter and its value increases. If prices continue to decline, people are less likely to spend their money. After all, if you believe that the price of, say, shirts will continue to drop, you’ll delay splurging on haberdashery.","2913","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"
"With enough time, the gold standard can create a deflationary spiral that brings an economy completely to a halt — which is what happened in the Great Depression. It was for this reason that Franklin D. Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard in the first days of his presidency, declaring that he would make the dollar into a “managed currency” the value of which policy makers might increase or decrease in response to economic need. In giving policy makers the power to regulate the money supply as they saw fit, Roosevelt created the expectation of a turn toward inflation, giving people reason to spend more money in the short term. (As Keynes observed, inflation causes problems, too, but at least it encourages spending, while the expectation of deflation can “inhibit the productive process altogether.”)","2914","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"
"Recovery began as soon as Roosevelt took office in March 1933, and his use of the dollar to spark recovery created the basis for the adoption of managed currencies around the world. Eleven years later, Bretton Woods gave multiple currencies fixed but adjustable rates. Nations now had precisely the freedom the gold standard denied them, to use monetary policy to regulate their economies. (The United States dollar had a nominal value in gold of $35 an ounce but the country was not obliged to set monetary policy according to how much gold it had.)","2915","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"
"Mr. Cruz correctly notes that the world economy enjoyed decades of prosperity under Bretton Woods, but that happened without a gold standard, not because of one. Why is a discredited policy now attractive to Republicans? The gold standard suits a political moment. Tying the dollar to an arbitrary quantity of shiny metal binds policy makers’ hands, robbing them of their discretion to act: The central bank can’t adjust the money supply to counteract crises or prevent them. These limits, for many Republicans, are good things. The gold standard is essentially the monetary equivalent of a government shutdown.","2916","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"
"A new Bretton Woods might be a good idea, to encourage greater international cooperation on monetary issues, but a gold standard is not, as nearly all economists agree. Even the mainstreaming of gold-standard talk can have bad consequences, should its proponents gain the ability to pressure central bankers to tighten the money supply, as a gold standard would oblige them to do. A return to the good old days of gold could leave us vulnerable to precisely the outcome Bretton Woods was intended to prevent: another Great Depression.","2917","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/opinion/campaign-stops/why-republicans-still-love-the-gold-standard.html?_r=0"

"When White House controversies dogged Mrs. Clinton as first lady, the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr made her sympathetic with his Javert-like investigations. When Mrs. Clinton showed flaws during her 2000 Senate race, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Rick Lazio looked even worse to many New Yorkers. And when the attacks on American diplomats in Libya sullied her record as secretary of state, Republicans struck many viewers as overreaching when they badgered her at a televised hearing.","3170","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0"
"Now, as she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination, Mrs. Clinton is struggling with declining poll numbers, questions about her honesty and doubts about her ultimate electability.

"By branding Mexicans as rapists, calling the children of immigrants “anchor babies,” denouncing abortions for rape and incest victims, and threatening to shut down the government over federal aid to Planned Parenthood, Republicans are giving Mrs. Clinton political help as she tries to divert attention from her woes and bounce back from a politically challenging summer.","3172","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0"
"Several Democratic Party officials with qualms about Mrs. Clinton, for instance, said she had reassured them about her political acumen and fighting form with a fiery speech Friday that assailed Donald J.

"Kate Gallego, another of the 713 Democratic superdelegates who have outsize power over the nomination, said she had decided to support Mrs. Clinton because of the way she took on Republicans in her speech. “It was energizing for me to hear Secretary Clinton say, ‘If equal pay for equal work is playing the “gender card,” then deal me in,’ ” said Ms. Gallego, who is from Arizona.","3175","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0"
"To sharpen the contrast, Mrs. Clinton and her team decided months ago to criticize Republicans by name rather than using general terms like “the other side” and “the Republicans,” as she often did during her 2008 presidential run. In her attacks, she also uses phrases like “the general election” in hopes of making voters comfortable with her as the Democratic standard-bearer.","3176","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0"

"Using one’s adversaries’ words against them is nothing new — Mr. Bush is doing it to Mr. Trump in a new video.

"On Tuesday, Mr. Bush said, “The federal government shouldn’t be involved in gun laws” — a comment that, like his opposition to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and his use of the term “anchor babies,” may haunt him if he is the Republican nominee, Clinton advisers argue.

"“Certainly the G.O.P. and Trump are giving her good ammo, and it is funny, but she’s like a magician — ‘Look over here, not at what’s really going on,’ ” said Richard Tafel, a Republican strategist, pointing to the inquiries related to her use of private email as secretary of state.","3181","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0"
"Attacking the Republicans is not just an applause-line strategy, though.

"“She is drawing a contrast here around who is best suited and best able to lead America into the future on behalf of everyday working Americans,” said Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton’s chief strategist. “Do the Republicans continue to reinforce their weaknesses as candidates and as a party? They clearly do, and she’s pointing that out.

"Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist and lobbyist who is close to the Clinton campaign, noted that the hyperaggressive news media environment virtually required politicians to attack rivals by name to draw maximum attention. “You’ll get covered if you say, ‘Jeb Bush believes this’ or ‘Scott Walker believes that,’ ” he said. (At this point, Mrs. Clinton almost never names her Democratic rivals, like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, preferring that they receive as little attention as possible.)","3184","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0"
"Mrs. Clinton also risks overreaching, however. Last week on Twitter, for instance, her campaign said, “How do Jeb Bush and Donald Trump differ on immigration? Spoiler alert: They don’t” — even though Mr. Bush has criticized Mr. Trump’s support for deporting illegal immigrants and repealing birthright citizenship. Some political fact-checkers dinged the Clinton assertion as mostly false, while a Bush spokesman said her attacks on Republicans would ultimately backfire.","3185","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0"
"“Hillary’s playbook has been clear from the start: divide and conquer, because she has no other path to victory,” said the spokesman, Tim Miller. “This is exactly what Americans are sick of in D.C., so that’s an opening for a Republican nominee to exploit.”","3186","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0"
"But for now, her supporters believe, the more Mrs. Clinton rakes Republicans over their own coals, the better chance voters will put aside misgivings about her and consider whether their views are closer to hers or to those of the Republicans.","3187","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0"
"“Everyone knows a choice election is more winnable than a referendum,” said Christine Pelosi, a Democratic superdelegate from California who is supporting Mrs. Clinton (and who is a daughter of the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi).

"“My message to them is very simple: Let’s do this right,” Mr. Obama told reporters while seated at his desk. “We’re in the midst of budget discussions.

"Such concerns were not merely partisan.

"The annual National Defense Authorization Act sets policies and spending levels for the military, but the actual funding must come through a defense appropriations bill that is stuck in Congress.

"The vetoed defense measure actually meets Mr. Obama’s overall funding request for defense programs because of an arcane budgeting mechanism lawmakers employed to avoid violating the spending caps. By shifting $38 billion to a special war funding account that does not count against those limits, Congress nudged military spending beyond the caps, while nondefense spending remains bound by them, something Mr. Obama has argued is unacceptable.","3200","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/us/politics/obama-vetoes-defense-bill-deepening-budget-fight-with-gop.html?_r=0"

"Such concerns have prompted Mr. Obama to threaten to veto defense policy bills in the past, but he has never followed through. On Thursday, some observers expressed surprise that the president would use the tool on military legislation, given that he backs many of its elements and the negotiation he is seeking is on spending levels across the government.","3205","http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/us/politics/obama-vetoes-defense-bill-deepening-budget-fight-with-gop.html?_r=0"
"“This is a very, very unusual use of the veto,” said Charles M.
