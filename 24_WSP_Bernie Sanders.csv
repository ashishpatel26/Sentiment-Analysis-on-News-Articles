"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a blunt self-described socialist who has become a favorite of progressive activists for his denunciations of big banks and the financial elite, will jump into the 2016 presidential campaign on Thursday, according to two people familiar with his plans.","April 28","1","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-bernie-sanders-to-launch-presidential-bid-on-thursday/2015/04/28/2b2802b8-edf0-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"One ally — who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Sanders’s timetable — said the 73-year-old senator is expected to make his intentions known this week and hold a rally in Vermont next month. He plans to run as a Democrat, according to his associates.","2","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-bernie-sanders-to-launch-presidential-bid-on-thursday/2015/04/28/2b2802b8-edf0-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"

"Former Rhode Island governor and ex-Republican Lincoln Chafee announced his pursuit of the Democratic nod this month, but his campaign has generated little interest from rank-and-file party members. Others on the Democratic radar — former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley and former Virginia senator Jim Webb — have not formally decided on running.","5","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-bernie-sanders-to-launch-presidential-bid-on-thursday/2015/04/28/2b2802b8-edf0-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"
"Sanders shares many of the same political stances as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a darling of liberals who has repeatedly said she is not running for president. That means Sanders may end up serving as the most prominent voice for the left wing of the party — particularly voters who are suspicious of Clinton and her ties to Wall Street.","6","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-bernie-sanders-to-launch-presidential-bid-on-thursday/2015/04/28/2b2802b8-edf0-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"

"Sanders chose to run in the Democratic primary because of to his interest in participating in the party’s primary debates, according to confidants.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) could be our first socialist hippie president.","April 30","19","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"OK, so he's not going to win. But he's running. And Sanders's political story is nothing if not unusual. In fact, he first came to Vermont as a part of the ""hippie migration"" in 1968.","20","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"The Vermont Historical Society described the great hippie influx of the mid- to late-'60s as a wave of ""disaffected"" young people who moved to ""to establish a new generation of experiments in communal life."" In a 1970 Playboy article on Vermont hippies, it was estimated that one-third of all people in the state between the ages of 18 to 34 at the time were hippies, or about 35,800 people, and there were 75 communes between 1968 and 1974.","21","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"It's not clear that Sanders ever considered himself one of the hippies, though he was described in a 2007 New York Times Magazine profile as ""a humorless aging hippie peacenik Socialist from Brooklyn.""","22","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"But Sanders did fit the mold of the counterculture. He led protests at the University of Chicago against racially segregated campus housing and opposed the Vietnam War. He told the New York Times he moved to Vermont because he had always been ""captivated by rural life."" He worked there as a carpenter, filmmaker and writer and became a member of socialist Liberty Union Party.","23","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"By the mid-'70s, the hippie-dom faded, but many who had moved there settled down, including Sanders. Amanda Gustin, public program coordinator for the historical society, told the Associated Press the hippie migration left a lasting mark on state politics, with those who remained becoming involved in local government.","24","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"""I think there's something to be said for sort of the more progressive wing of politics getting its start in Vermont in the 1970s,"" she said.","25","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"Sanders lost five statewide races before winning the Burlington mayoral race in 1981 -- by 10 votes against a Democrat who didn't bother to campaign because he thought he had the election in the bag.","26","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"Sanders said there was ""a lot of fear in the beginning"" about him being socialist, but that subsided over his first term. ""We have not transformed the world. Much of what we do is not radical,"" he told the Associated Press at the time.","27","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"His city hall office was decorated with a poster of Eugene V. Debs, who ran for president on the Socialist Party ticket from the 1900s to 1920s. U.S. News & World Report named Sanders one of America's 20 best mayor in 1988. He was mayor until 1989, and was elected to the U.S. House in 1991.","28","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"
"""I am a socialist, of course I am a socialist,"" he told a Democratic opponent in a mayoral debate, according to an Associated Press story in 1983. ""To hold a vision that society can be fundamentally different, to believe that all people can be equal, that is not a new idea. ... I don't think there is an administration in the country that is more progressive than this one.""","29","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-from-hippie-migrant-to-would-be-president/"

"Vermont Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders is going to formally enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday. He's not going to win.","April 29","31","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"This is not, by any traditional definition, breaking news. Sanders, aside from being an avowed Socialist, is little known outside of the most liberal of circles nationally and has no intention of matching Hillary Clinton dollar for fundraising dollar. (Even if Sanders wanted to try to raise the sort of money that would make him competitive with Clinton, he couldn't do it. Or come anywhere close.)","32","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"No one knows those realities better than Sanders. So, why run? Because Sanders is part of a new-ish breed of presidential candidate: One who runs a cause more than campaign.","33","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"Sanders isn't, really, concerned with winning. He's been around politics long enough -- he's been in state and federal politics almost continuously since 1981 -- to understand how big a frontrunner Clinton is and to grasp his own limitations as a candidate. Of Clinton, he told the Post back in February: ""Based on her history, do I think she is going to be as bold as needs to be in addressing the major crises that we face? Probably not.""","34","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"What Sanders' candidacy is really about is influencing the debate within the Democratic party in the quadrennial pinchpoint of a presidential election. Sanders wants to drag Clinton (and everyone else in the field) to the left on issues like trade (he opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership), campaign finance reform and income inequality.","35","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"It's a role he's quite familiar with. Sanders rose to national prominence back in 2010 when he filibustered an extension of the Bush era tax cuts.","36","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"","37","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"The Almanac of American Politics described Sanders' filibuster this way: ""The speech proved so popular that it temporarily shut down the Senate video server and put his name atop Twitter's list of trending topics."" (Twitter: So you know it mattered!)","38","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"The Bush tax cuts got extended -- but Sanders made his point, and his name.","39","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"That episode is a worthwhile blueprint for those seeking to understand what Sanders is up to (or will be up to) in the 2016 race. And, there's already some evidence that Sanders candidacy or, maybe more accurately, what his candidacy represents to the left, is having some impact.","40","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"Clinton has revealed very little of her 2016 policy platform but one place where she's seems likely to push hard is on the issue of campaign finance reform. In one of her first appearance as an official candidate, she told an Iowa audience that the campaign financing system was ""dysfunctional"" and in a (very brief) follow-up interview with two Post reporters she added: ""We do have a plan. We have a plan for my plan."" (Um, ok.)","41","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"She's also emphasized her bona fides on the income inequality fight in the early days of her campaign -- insisting that it's a fight that she's long been involved in and will take to Washington if elected next November. “Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times,"" she said in the video announcing her presidential candidacy. ""But the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion.""","42","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"On trade -- and TPP, more specifically -- Clinton has avoided taking a position, notable because of President Obama's support for the deal. ""Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,” Clinton said last week in New Hampshire, a statement that says a whole lot of not much.","43","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"That positioning is not because Clinton is nervous about the prospect of ""Bernie for President."" But, what Sanders' candidacy will do is ensure that someone in the race is holding Clinton's feet to the fire on these issues of import to the left. Sanders, in debates especially but on the campaign trail more generally, will push Clinton to not only affirm the general sentiments she's expressed on campaign finance, income inequality and trade but also to put out specifics of how exactly she would approach those issues if elected president.","44","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"Sure, everyone not named ""Hillary Clinton"" in the race will try to force Clinton to more clearly elucidate her stances on issues. But, unlike, say, Martin O'Malley, who would love to wind up in the Clinton Cabinet, Sanders has nothing to lose. He's not going to be on the Democratic ticket or in Clinton's Cabinet no matter what happens. So, he's free to take the fight to Clinton in ways that others in the field simply won't.","45","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"
"That's not a strategy to win a presidential nomination. But, as a strategy to make a point, it's pretty damn good.","46","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-isnt-going-to-be-president-but-he-matters-anyway/"

"Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is officially running for president, meaning that there will be at least two contestants in the Democratic race (after what’s been going on in the city where he was mayor for eight years, Martin O’Malley may be reconsidering). I am obligated by law to point out that Sanders’ chances of beating Hillary Clinton are slight, but the question many have already raised is what effect his candidacy will have on Clinton. Will it pull her to the left? Give her room to run to the right? Force her into missteps? It might do any of those things, or none of them.","April 30","114","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-really-matters-heres-why/"
"But Sanders could actually cause more headaches for the Republicans running for president — if he succeeds on focusing the campaign on his area of interest.","115","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-really-matters-heres-why/"
"To understand why, you first have to know that Sanders’ candidacy will be almost entirely about economic issues. Advocacy for the interests of what we might call the non-wealthy has always been at the top of Sanders’ agenda and at the heart of his political identity. That’s the reason he’s finally running now, at the tail end of a long career: the national debate has moved in his direction, with issues like wage stagnation and inequality now being brought up even by some conservatives.","116","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-really-matters-heres-why/"
"But as far as Hillary Clinton is concerned, that’s just fine. Bernie Sanders isn’t going to pull her to the left, because she was already moving that way. She’s talking about issues like inequality and criminal justice reform in terms that she might not have used 10 or 20 years ago, and in some cases she’s actually taking positions that she wouldn’t have then. As Greg and I have argued, whether this evolution is sincere isn’t particularly relevant, because she’s reflecting the consensus within her party, and if she becomes president her actions will follow along. The reason she doesn’t have to be pulled to the left by Sanders, O’Malley, or anyone else is that the entire environment around these issues has changed. Talking about them in more liberal terms isn’t just good for her in the primaries, it’s good for her in the general election, too.","117","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-really-matters-heres-why/"
"Nevertheless, Sanders’ presence will concentrate the debate even more on economic issues, because that’s most of what he’ll be stressing. Every bit of attention he gets will serve to keep the economic discussion at the forefront. And you know who isn’t so happy about that? The Republican candidates.","118","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-really-matters-heres-why/"
"They’ll all have their economic plans, of course, and will be happy to tell you why they’re superior. But the current debate on the economy puts them at a disadvantage. They know that they’re at odds with the public on many economic issues, like the minimum wage, paid vacation time, or increasing taxes on the wealthy. Though they’ve begun to talk about inequality, it’s obvious that they haven’t quite figured out how to address the issue without running up against their traditional advocacy for things like cutting upper-income taxes and reducing regulations on corporations and Wall Street.","119","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-really-matters-heres-why/"
"When Sanders says, “We need an economy that works for all of us and not just for a handful of billionaires,” few voters disagree. Republicans say they want that, too, but the fact that some specific billionaires like Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers are so eagerly bankrolling their campaigns makes it an awkward argument for them to make.","120","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-really-matters-heres-why/"
"And Sanders will draw attention to the billionaires funding Republican campaigns: At his presser today, he was asked about donations to the Clinton Foundation, and he pushed back by asking: Where are the conflicts of interests when the Koch brothers are spending hundreds of millions to influence the outcome of the presidential race? In other words, Sanders won’t only attack Clinton on the money question; he’ll helpfully point out that GOP attacks on this are rather questionable, given their own funding sources.","121","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-really-matters-heres-why/"
"The best outcome for Republicans is if the campaign revolves around other issues where they might find more support for their positions and they can more easily attack Hillary Clinton. The more attention Bernie Sanders gets, the more attention economic inequality gets, which is something Republicans would rather avoid.","122","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/30/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-really-matters-heres-why/"

"There are different ways to measure “income,” and the exact figures vary depending on the time frame and whether taxes and government benefits are considered. The key studies on this topic look at different measures, data sets and time frames, so there is no accurate comparison between studies.","140","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"Sanders’s office pointed to a New York Times article by Justin Wolfers, a University of Michigan economics professor, that compared the growth in average income among Americans between 2009 and 2012-2013, excluding capital gains. The average income for the top 1 percent rose while the average income for the 99 percent fell, and “so far, all of the gains from the recovery have gone to the 1 percent,” the article said. This is where Sanders’s “99 percent” figure comes from.","141","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"Wolfers’s article analyzed research by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Saez, along with Paris School of Economics professor Thomas Piketty, has produced research that is one of the most widely cited sources for assertions that the economic recovery has disproportionately benefited the richest 1 percent of Americans. Wolfers said he used Saez’s research to generate his findings; Saez confirmed the calculation in an e-mail.","142","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"A January update of Saez’s report shows that the top 1 percent captured 91 percent of the total growth in the 2009-2012 period. The top 1 percent in 2013 had incomes above $392,000, the report said.","143","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"But top tax rates increased in 2013 — a change Sanders supported — and led many wealthy Americans to shift taxable income into 2012 instead of 2013. So the 2012 top estimate probably is skewed high, and the 2013 likely is too low.","144","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"The Saez/Piketty research defines income as the sum of the pre-tax cash income reported on individual tax returns, such as wages, salaries, pensions and capital income. It used realized capital gains, but also provided numbers that excluded them. It does not include any government transfer programs. The 2013 data was preliminary tax filings from the Internal Revenue Service. This is a narrow definition of household income that skews toward the top of the income distribution and is likely to show the most extreme rise in income inequality.","145","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"Critics of this research say the method is too narrow. Others have used the Current Population Survey by the Census Bureau that does not show as big of a gain in the top 1 percent, but census data is known to be unreliable for this information because not enough people in that population respond to census surveys.","146","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"Another important context is that the top 1 percent saw a steep decline in income compared with the rest of the percentile, when the financial industry crashed. As the stock market recovers, this population will earn significantly more in capital gains than the 99 percent. Figure 1 in Saez’s research update shows how the income increases when capital gains are included.","147","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"One study that offers context for other factors in the income inequality debate is by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison to the Saez study, but it is a broader look at income by including benefits from government transfer programs, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, Medicare and Medicaid.","148","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"Although these benefits are not provided in cash, they are included in the income calculation because they “increase people’s ability to purchase consumer goods and services,” according to the November 2014 CBO report. This calculation includes automatic stabilizers (such as food stamps, unemployment insurance and earned income tax credit) that more lower-income families qualified for through the recession and the slow recovery, to make up for lost income.","149","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"The CBO report looks at 1979 through 2011, the most recent data available for its calculation. Government transfers increase the incomes of lower-income groups significantly more than higher-income groups, the CBO found. In 2011, transfers accounted for more than one-third of before-tax income for the bottom two income quintiles.","150","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"Federal tax rates rise with income. CBO found that after taxes, the income levels for the lowest and middle quintiles were higher than the measure that Saez used. The top 1 percent of Americans had an average tax rate of 29 percent, while Americans in the bottom four quintiles paid between 1.9 percent to about 15 percent. By 2013, CBO estimated, the top 1 percent would pay 33.3 percent in federal taxes.","151","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"Sanders is a proponent of raising taxes on the wealthy and protecting government transfer programs. Yet the statistics he uses do not reflect those factors.","152","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"When asked why he used an income calculation that disregards steps taken to help Americans in the 99 percent, his spokesman Michael Briggs wrote: “Saez and the senator both are looking at how the market economy is distributing income gains. Yes, there are programs that help keep some families afloat. But the senator’s remarks were focused on the unevenness of the recovery and the extent to which income gains are flowing directly to the 1 percent. The fact that there is redirection via transfer programs does not undercut the accuracy of what he said.” (Update: Sanders now cites updated figures that Saez released in June 2015, that the top 1 percent captured 58 percent of total real income growth from 2009 to 2014. This shows how income data can change coming out of a recession. Kudos to Sanders for citing updated figures.)","153","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"The various income-inequality measures make it difficult to draw accurate comparisons between studies. In addition, there is no comparable research for 2012 and 2013 (the years that Sanders uses) to compare how the recovery would look under a broader definition of “income.” Sanders is correct that the top 1 percent of Americans have benefited disproportionately, but there is dispute over just how much.","154","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/17/bernie-sanders-claim-that-99-percent-of-new-income-is-going-to-top-1-percent-of-americans/"
"The calculation Sanders cites is one measure, but it is a specific and narrow one that skews toward a more extreme portrayal of income inequality.

Just this week, Professor Wolfers said again “The numbers that Sen. Sanders cited are exactly right – I calculated them myself, double-checked my figures and confirmed them with other leading economists.

"I replied that it was roughly 10 percent. Others — like Politico's Ben White — said it was more like .1 percent. The question — and the back and forth over it — got me to thinking what would happen on the very small chance that Clinton did decide not to run. After all, she has only hinted at her interest publicly, and has yet to take the steps — leadership PAC, etc. — that would indicate clear interest. Virtually everything we know about Clinton's plans come from staff movements and quotes to reporters from ""those in the know"" who demand anonymity to share their knowledge.","383","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/30/what-if-hillary-doesnt-run/"

"There's a different dynamic at work now — particularly if Clinton waits another few months to make clear exactly what she is going to do in 2016. We are rapidly approaching the point of no return for Clinton. That is, if she were to suddenly take herself out of the race in, say, two months' time, there would be a massive sense of doom within the party. The shock of the decision would reverberate for weeks — and maybe even months — making it hard for anyone looking to fill the void she left behind.","385","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/30/what-if-hillary-doesnt-run/"
"Now, that doom would eventually be followed by a wild scramble among the Bidens, Martin O'Malleys and, yes, even Elizabeth Warrens of the party for the donors, activists and staffers who had all been assumed to be part of the Clinton machine.

"Simply put: For Clinton to pass on the race — and especially if she waits until summer to make her decision public — would be absolutely disastrous for her party's chances of holding onto the White House next November. She and her budding team have to know that, and it's hard for me to imagine that she would have let things go this far — there is, literally, an entire campaign and outside Clinton world already in place for her — if she had any serious or lingering doubts about whether she was going to make the race.","387","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/30/what-if-hillary-doesnt-run/"

"7. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): Sanders appears serious about running, which is why he’s on this list.

"4. Vice President Biden: Biden assured us recently that he is serious about running for president in 2016 — probably because folks like us are increasingly dubious and because he hasn’t actually done much of the legwork to put a team in place. Even if he did run, we still have a hard time seeing him catch fire.

"3. Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley: If there’s anybody who can conceivably beat Clinton by running to her left — and might actually run — it’s O’Malley. He’s got lots of liberal bona fides from his time as Maryland governor, and he checks lots of other boxes — even as he didn’t really leave office on a high note.

"The Post reports: “Hillary Rodham Clinton isn’t just running against Republicans. She’s also running against parts of her husband’s legacy. On issues large and small, the Democratic presidential contender is increasingly distancing herself from — or even opposing — key policies pushed by Bill Clinton while he was in the White House, from her recent skepticism on free-trade pacts to her full embrace of gay rights.” Of Clinton’s many political sins, I don’t find this inherently problematic and Republicans should be cautious about mocking this, especially when it comes to crime. (“The starkest example yet came Wednesday, when Hillary Clinton delivered an impassioned address condemning the ‘era of incarceration’ ushered in during the 1990s in the wake of her husband’s 1994 crime bill — though she never mentioned him or the legislation by name.”)","601","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/hillary-clinton-isnt-stuck-with-bills-policies/"
"To begin with, Republicans were with Clinton in the 1990s on crime. Twenty years later, there are legitimate questions as to whether reforms went too far, what the consequences are and what changes, if any, need to be made. The policies were very successful in tandem with innovations in policing to reduce crime. So nothing wrong with supporting tough crime measures then, and tweaking them now. Many Republicans are doing exactly the same thing.","602","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/hillary-clinton-isnt-stuck-with-bills-policies/"
"Moreover, there is no requirement that Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush, for that matter, adhere to their relatives’ positions. Isn’t that the point — that candidates need to define themselves?","603","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/hillary-clinton-isnt-stuck-with-bills-policies/"
"What Republicans should care about — and watch with increasing interest now that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is in the race — is to note how far left the Democratic Party has shifted. The media like to mock Republicans for becoming more ideological and less pragmatic, but the exact same trend has happened on the left. Consider how relatively robust was Clinton’s foreign policy compared with President Obama’s or how violent is the reaction against free trade on the left.","604","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/hillary-clinton-isnt-stuck-with-bills-policies/"
"Republicans should keep in mind several factors. First, if the Democrats go far left, the middle remains vacant. It would be a mistake to choose someone equally extreme on the right, one devoted to ideology at the expense of reality. If ever Republicans needed to cement their place as the center-right party, it is now. Second, Republicans should test to see just how far left she will need to go to make Sanders and other opponents non-factors, and more important, to energize her own base. Is she going to run for “a third Obama term, but worse”? Single payer, cap and trade, repeal of the Hyde Amendment (i.e. taxpayer funding for abortion for any reason at any time), appeasement of Iran — where will it stop? To the extent Clinton emphasizes entrenchment and even expansion of the welfare state, Republicans have an opening to challenge her on the cost, efficacy and intrusiveness of her behemoth welfare state. And finally, Republicans should not step on their own message that she is a candidate of the past. If she is now departing from the past, how can Republicans criticize her for keeping up with the times?","605","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/hillary-clinton-isnt-stuck-with-bills-policies/"
"The biggest concern for Republicans should not be to pummel Clinton — they are doing a fine job along with the media in damaging her credibility. The much more important task is for candidates to provide themselves as the opposite of Hillary Clinton — honest, contemporary, realistic and competent. Once they accomplish that, the comparison will follow and they hope the choice will be clear and stark. For governors, that means reminding voters what they have done and the degree to which they led in bipartisan fashion in states not necessarily friendly to Republicans. For senators, that means trying to come up with some leadership and executive bona fides. They need to stop acting like senators (actually reverting to behavior of minority senators who are out to make points, not accomplish much) and start presenting an agenda. And for non-politicians like Carly Fiorina, it means showing her superior analytical and problem-solving skills.","606","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/30/hillary-clinton-isnt-stuck-with-bills-policies/"

"The current system for selecting nominees in the Democratic Party is less than 50 years old.

"Sanders is merely the latest such challenger to make some early noise in a Democratic primary race. He’s not even the first one from Vermont: In 2004, former governor Howard Dean rode his opposition to the Iraq war to the top of the field before eventually finishing a distant third in Iowa. That, combined with his famous caucus-night scream, was effectively the end of his candidacy. Dean followed in the footsteps of others, such as then-Sen. Gary Hart (Colo.) in 1984 (and briefly in 1988), California Gov. Jerry Brown in 1976 and again in 1992, and former senator Bill Bradley (N.J.) in 2000. Obama played this role in 2008. The most famous and most successful post-McGovern, pre-Obama challenge came from Sen. Ted Kennedy (Mass.) in 1980, when he almost defeated Jimmy Carter, the incumbent president of his own party.","677","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"All of these challengers had their moments, rising in the polls, firing up the grass roots and going from unknown underdogs to legitimate contenders. But every one of them, except Obama, ultimately came up short. Their early successes all had some similar explanations. First, the most liberal voters tend to tune in sooner and engage more actively, giving an initial boost to progressive candidates. Second, the overriding bias in political press coverage is toward a competitive race, which means that challengers often receive media attention that exceeds their chances of winning. Finally and perhaps most importantly, skepticism of the establishment is woven into the fabric of the Democratic Party — if the party leadership, the donors and the pundits are all for one person, many in the rank and file start to explore other options.","678","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"Of course, every election is different, and every historical parallel is imperfect. Each of these candidates did things right and wrong in their races; some made gaffes, and others ran out of money. But ultimately, similar factors played into their defeats.","679","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"Presidential campaigns are massively sophisticated, expensive operations. Insurgent challenges all start as underfunded, fly-by-night operations, with just enough resources to gain attention in the early days. But when it comes to actually turning out voters, particularly in the very complex Iowa caucus system — which requires a candidate to have at least 15 percent support to get any delegates and gives no extra points for winning by big margins in liberal precincts — you need a campaign organization worthy of that task.","680","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"Even if organizers manage to set up a strong operation, many challengers still falter under the intense klieg lights that are attracted to a viable contender for the United States presidency. Lifelong politicians who are first-time presidential candidates think they are ready for the scrutiny, and they are almost all wrong. Finally, every anti-establishment challenger except Obama failed to expand his base beyond the left wing of the party. Bradley and Dean, for instance, did very well with liberal, white Democrats. That can be enough to win key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, especially in a multi-candidate field, where you may only need a third of the electorate to come out on top. But getting sufficient delegates to win the nomination requires a very broad base of support. It means building a wide coalition of voters, including moderate Democrats and even independents, as well as African Americans and the growing number of Latinos in the party.","681","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"Obama’s campaign succeeded where everyone else’s failed for two main reasons. His tremendous popularity with African American voters was critical. Although Obama won the black vote by margins as high as 9 to 1 in some states, this was not preordained. Clinton led Obama among African American voters in most polls until after he won Iowa. Obama also found a way to hold his liberal base while simultaneously attracting the enthusiastic support of self-identified independents and moderates. In 2008, we did best in open contests, which allowed anyone to participate regardless of party registration.","682","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"Essentially, Obama benefitted from two separate phenomena: liberal frustration with the Democratic Party establishment for supporting the Iraq war and moderate disenchantment with President George W. Bush over Iraq, Hurricane Katrina and a host of other issues. Getting the support of those independents and Republicans was key for us in a number of caucus states, including Iowa.","683","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"So far, at least, there’s little reason to think Sanders can duplicate what led Obama to victory. Yes, he’s surged in the polls to be the clear challenger to Clinton, a remarkably rapid and impressive feat for a senator from a small state who has never run for national office before in order to seek the nomination. If his momentum continues, and if former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley and others can take chunks of the vote, Sanders could win Iowa and even New Hampshire.","684","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"But Sanders still looks likely to follow in the tradition of Bradley and Dean. Polls show that he’s doing well with liberal white voters and struggling everywhere else, and he has negligible support and limited name identification among black and Latino voters. There is no doubt that Sanders has lit the progressive wing of the Democratic Party on fire by speaking out boldly against inequality and excess on Wall Street. But he faces real challenges that Obama did not in expanding his base of support. Sanders is from a small state with very few minority voters, while Obama had deeper relationships to build on, especially with the African American community.","685","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"Sanders’s campaign is growing rapidly, but even with new field offices opening fast, it’s still less than half the size of Obama’s organization at a similar juncture in our race: In July 2007, Obama had 80 paid staffers working in 25 offices in Iowa. Obama was able to raise more early money for his campaign; that, coupled with his potential to make history as the nation’s first black president, attracted a very experienced set of advisors with deep knowledge of how to run a sophisticated operation. While Sanders has decided to play the role of the liberal challenger to Clinton, pushing her to the left at every opportunity, Obama ran a much less ideological campaign, which allowed him to build a broader base of support from the outset.","686","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"If 2008 is not the best parallel for Sanders vs. Clinton, what is? Probably the 2000 contest between Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley. That contest, like this one, was about who would get a chance to succeed a two-term Democratic president. That contest, like this one, was essentially a two-person race (though this could change in the coming months). And in that contest, like this one, the Democratic Party was looking to redefine itself for a new era. Bradley made a surprisingly strong challenge to a sitting vice president, forcing Gore to shake up his campaign, move his headquarters from D.C. to Nashville and retool his entire effort. Ultimately, though, Bradley could not broaden his base of support, and he ended up losing all 50 states to Gore.","687","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
"History says that Clinton is likely to be our nominee and that Sanders is doomed to repeat the fate of Bradley and the rest. Of course, history said the same thing about Obama, and there’s a reason that people say “anything is possible in politics.” But the odds are that by this time next year, the 2008 campaign will remain the exception, not the rule.","688","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"

"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) found himself at odds with some immigration reform advocates Thursday, defending his 2007 vote against a comprehensive immigration bill and telling an audience hosted by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce that ""open borders"" were a threat to American jobs.","July 30","747","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"

"Sanders, who supported the 2013 version of immigration reform, had already waded into a moral and economic fight inside the Democratic Party. The latest round began with an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein, who asked if Sanders could favor ""sharply raising the level of immigration we permit, even up to a level of open borders.""","749","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"The Vermont senator vehemently disagreed. ""That's a Koch brothers proposal,"" he said. ""What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don't believe in that.""","750","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"Many progressives do believe in that. They've argued for it, in the face of opposition from many labor unions. In the run-up to Sanders's appearance, Democrats who want to blunt his campaign had circulated the Vox interview and excerpts from his old statements about immigration and protectionism. When reporters were invited to ask questions, all but one asked about immigration. CNN's Dan Merica read back some of Sanders's quotes about the 2007 immigration bill and invited the senator to respond.","751","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"“My concern about the bill that I voted against,” said Sanders, “was that there was too much emphasis on bringing low-wage workers into this country. What I want to see, and what is better about the recent bill, is a pathway toward citizenship, which is absolutely essential.”","752","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"MSNBC's Alex Seitz-Wald read to Sanders from a statement by the pro-reform group FWD.us, funded and founded by some large corporations to advocate for the 2013 bill. According to FWD, Sanders had embraced -- for years, but especially in his talk with Vox -- ""the totally-debunked notion that immigrants coming to the U.S. are taking jobs and hurting Americans.""","753","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"Sanders disputed that. ""You’ve got to be careful about defining the word, ‘immigrants,’” he said. “What they are talking about is completely opening up the border. That was the question, should we have a completely open border, so that anybody can come into the United States of America. If that were to happen, which I strongly disagree with, there is no question in my mind that that was substantially lower wages in this country.","754","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"""When you have 36 percent of Hispanic kids in this country who can’t find jobs, and you bring a lot of unskilled workers into this country, what do you think happens to that 36 percent of kids who are today unemployed? Fifty-one percent of African-American kids? I don’t think there’s any presidential candidate, none, who thinks we should open up the borders,"" said Sanders.","755","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"In another answer, to Huffington Post reporter Elise Foley, Sanders insisted that he could support the 2013 immigration bill without favoring the surge in visas that Wall Street wanted. ""There is a great difference in saying that we welcome immigrants, that we're going to provide a path toward citizenship to those immigrants that are in this country today, and saying: Oh, we're not going to have any borders at all,"" said Sanders.","756","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"The senator did not further explain why open borders would suppress wages and job opportunity, while a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the country would not. ""Some of my Republican colleagues apparently think that the solution is, I guess, to round up everybody and throw them out of the country,"" said Sanders, who referred several times to the story of his immigrant parents. ""If suddenly, every undocumented worker in this country disappears, the economy would collapse.""","757","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"Still, Sanders's economic arguments fell flat with Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, who moderated the event.","758","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"""I think he's a bit off the mark,"" said Palomarez. ""I think he's likening allowing more immigrants coming into the country to taking American jobs. Our position is that some of these jobs [are some] that some of our young people wouldn't take. We don't see young people lining up to pluck chickens.""","759","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/"
"Palomarez, who was hosting vetting sessions with some of Sanders's rivals, said he appreciated that the senator was at least honest about his protectionism.

Very often at budget hearings you will hear me say as the major deficit hawk in the committee — and I refer to myself as that because I voted against the war in Iraq, I voted against tax breaks for millionaires, I voted against the Medicare prescription drug program, I voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, which has caused so many problems.

"Bernie Sanders has been getting a bum rap from people who purport to be his fellow progressives. He’s been chastised for not supporting open borders: Totally open immigration, the Vermont senator told Vox’s Ezra Klein, was “a Koch brothers proposal” that would erode the “concept of the nation state.” He’s been accused of downplaying the effects of racism by emphasizing the effects of classism — a more valid criticism to which Sanders, after his initial, grumpy response to protesters last month, has responded more recently by highlighting the racism of many police practices. Some critics have added that Sanders's allegedly blinkered vision stems from his decades in nearly all-white Vermont, or from his admiration for the social democracies of nearly all-white Scandinavia, or from the purported racial blindness of social democracy itself.","August 5","818","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-socialist-in-good-company/2015/08/05/4385153e-3b9e-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"
"To fault Sanders for failing to support open borders, however, is to hold him to a standard that no present-day elected official in any nation I know of has met. Like his fellow liberals and, polling shows, most Americans, Sanders supports offering citizenship to those immigrants, documented and not (excepting those who’ve committed serious crimes), who are already here, and stopping the efforts to deport them. Like most Americans, Sanders clearly supports the continuation of legal immigration.","819","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-socialist-in-good-company/2015/08/05/4385153e-3b9e-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"
"But Sanders is on sound historical ground when he asserts that a permanent policy of open borders would have consequences that progressives would come to regret. It is a sad constant of human, and American, history that the solidarity needed to build workers’ organizations and social benefits waxes when people can overcome the divisions of ethnicity and tradition and wanes when they can’t. As Harvard historian Lizabeth Cohen documents in “Making a New Deal,” her study of Chicago workers in the decades between the world wars, those workers’ efforts to form industrial unions in 1919 failed in large degree due to divisions between the various immigrant communities, and between them and the native-born. Their efforts succeeded, however, in the late 1930s, once those immigrants and their children had been in the United States long enough to forge a more common culture with other immigrant and native-born groups. It’s not that those groups had abandoned their traditional identities, but, with the federal government all but shutting down immigration in 1924, the pull of tradition and the effects of ethnic insulation were no longer continually renewed. Indeed, one of the most sobering facts of U.S. history is that the great social legislation of the New Deal and its successors came forth during the 40-year period (1924-65) when a federal ban on most immigration reduced the percentage of foreign-born Americans to an all-time low.","820","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-socialist-in-good-company/2015/08/05/4385153e-3b9e-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"
"It’s also true that the nations with the most extensive social rights and benefits, and the highest levels of social and economic equality, have been the Scandinavian social democracies — and that, as these nations have become home to immigrants from developing nations and refugees from the world’s war zones in recent years, they’ve each seen right-wing nativist parties spring up and claim between 15 and 20 percent of the vote. Then again, right-wing nativist parties have sprung up and done just about as well in virtually every European nation, even as the Tea Party has commanded an equivalent level of support in the United States.","821","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-socialist-in-good-company/2015/08/05/4385153e-3b9e-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"
"These developments can hardly be traced to the ostensible racial insensitivities of social democracy. Indeed, the social democratic parties’ commitment to racial equity has a long and storied history. The definitive New Deal-era indictment of white racism against African Americans was Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal’s landmark study “An American Dilemma,” which laid the groundwork for the Supreme Court’s overturning of the doctrine of separate but equal. It was the Swedish social democrats who provided the first significant support from a Western nation to Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress, and who welcomed refugees to their shores well before the rest of Europe (while opposing open borders for economic reasons). Indeed, it’s the policies of the social democratic, socialist and labor parties of Europe — embracing immigrants into their ranks and supporting their eligibility for social benefits — against which Europe’s nativist right has risen.","822","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-socialist-in-good-company/2015/08/05/4385153e-3b9e-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"
"Does diversity invariably dim progressive prospects? A survey of most large U.S. cities (and the largest state, California) today, where coalitions of minorities, immigrant groups and white progressives have come to power, suggests that it needn’t. Tellingly, though, those cities (and California) still have unions that are a force for cross-racial solidarity. In the absence of such institutions, as Bernie Sanders has cautioned us, our capacity for tribal resentment can bring us all down.","823","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-socialist-in-good-company/2015/08/05/4385153e-3b9e-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"

"That said, I think Glenn Kessler, the fact checker himself, graded Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, too harshly regarding a number the senator cited on the labor market effect of the spending-cuts-also-known-as sequestration. Sanders is guilty of some degree of misinterpretation, but he’s making an important point, grounded in nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis. I would have given him one Pinocchio at most, if not a Papageno, along with two Taminos (read on). Yet our fact checker hit him with the full four Pinocchios!","829","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/17/the-post-fact-checker-graded-sen-bernie-sanders-too-harshly/"
"Here’s the issue, and for the record, I wouldn’t be going on about all this were there not an important fiscal-policy point at the heart of it all. Sanders asked the CBO to estimate the economic effect of eliminating the automatic spending reductions for 2016 and 2017. In reply, the budget office reported that, among other effects I’ll note in a moment, the increased government spending (“outlays”) would lead to more of what they call FTEs — full-time-equivalent employment — in both years.","830","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/17/the-post-fact-checker-graded-sen-bernie-sanders-too-harshly/"
"I’ll take a leap here and assume you’re not familiar with an FTE, which isn’t the same thing as a job. According to CBO, “a year of full-time-equivalent employment…is 40 hours of employment per week for one year.” It doesn’t necessarily mean that someone gets a new job that wasn’t there before. It could mean a couple of people with half-time work now going full time and nobody gets a new job. (There are still more than 6 million involuntary part-timers out there who would very much approve of that scenario.) Or it could mean two new half-time workers account for one FTE, or four new quarter-time workers.","831","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/17/the-post-fact-checker-graded-sen-bernie-sanders-too-harshly/"
"The fact checker objected to the way Sanders represented these data, specifically his claim that sequestration was responsible for “the loss of as many as 1.4 million jobs over the next two years.” Based on the difference between jobs and FTE’s, I can see where the fact checker would raise an eyebrow. A more accurate way to say this might be “the equivalent of as many as 1.4 million full-time jobs” or, more accurately, as EPI’s Josh Biven’s puts it: “Over the two years in question, the total hours of full-time employment that would be extinguished if the [spending] caps are not lifted would equal 1.4 million full-time jobs.” (Clearly, Bivens is not running for president.)","832","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/17/the-post-fact-checker-graded-sen-bernie-sanders-too-harshly/"
"Next, to its credit, the CBO gave a range of estimates (e.g., 200K to 800K FTEs in 2016), and Sanders, in the interest of emphasizing the job-killing properties of the sequester, chose the high end of the range. Kessler makes the point that when someone says “as many as” X million jobs would be lost, “that’s a signal that a politician is using the high-end of a range.” Tru dat, and as long as we’re getting all truthy together, I’m sure I’ve used this construction myself. It’s a touch squirrelly, but it’s factually accurate.","833","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/17/the-post-fact-checker-graded-sen-bernie-sanders-too-harshly/"
"[This seems like a good place for another nuanced point. I’ve recently objected to the use of dynamic scoring in budgets, where macroeconomic effects such as these are incorporated into budget scores. The problem is that given ranges like the one cited above, they’re too uncertain to build into an official score. But I’ve always been careful in such rants to point out that dynamic analyses like this one from CBO are instructive. They just shouldn’t be used in official scoring.]","834","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/17/the-post-fact-checker-graded-sen-bernie-sanders-too-harshly/"
"Finally, and this has less to do with the fact check than just trying to flesh out the full implications of the CBO report, the budget office also points out that its jobs and growth numbers are net of the negative effect it assumes from higher deficit spending if the caps are lifted and the new spending is unpaid for. According to CBO’s model, the extra borrowing by the government would crowd out more productive private-sector borrowing. Given the low cost of capital and the absence of evidence of any such crowding out in recent years, it’s a questionable assumption, but we’re talking 2017, so maybe…but I doubt it.","835","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/17/the-post-fact-checker-graded-sen-bernie-sanders-too-harshly/"
"My experience is that once he has ruled, the fact checker can’t be moved, so let me do my own scoring. In the great Mozart opera “The Magic Flute,” the character Papageno gets his mouth padlocked for telling a lie.

"I’d maybe give Sanders one Papageno on interpretation, but I’d also give him two Tamino’s (the virtuous prince from the same opera) for elevating this point about the economic damage from these mindless budget caps.

"MADISON, Wis. — Bernie Sanders stood before 10,000 screaming fans in this liberal college town on Wednesday night and promised to fulfill all of their progressive dreams: paid vacation for all, generous maternity leave, tuition-free public colleges, a minimum wage of $15, no more big banks, less youth unemployment, dramatic prison reform and an end to economic inequality.","July 2","892","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/thousands-expected-to-gather-in-madison-for-latest-sanders-rally/2015/07/01/c116019e-2018-11e5-aeb9-a411a84c9d55_story.html"

That’s especially true now: Walker’s proposed budget calls for heavy cuts to the public university system, and he has complained about tenured professors not working hard enough for their salaries.

"Historically, the role of the two great American socialist standard-bearers Eugene Debs and Thomas, and such socialist members of Congress as Meyer London and Ronald Dellums, was to advance ideas that their progressive compatriots were sometimes able to enact — partially — years or decades later, or that later were transformed into common sense. Running for president in 1904, Debs campaigned for the eight-hour workday, social insurance and women’s suffrage. Representing New York’s Lower East Side in Congress during the 1910s, London introduced legislation to create paid maternity leave, something Congress still has yet to get around to. In 1942, Thomas was virtually the only prominent American to publicly oppose the internment of Japanese Americans.","1007","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-democratic-socialist-campaign-its-about-time/2015/05/14/05634e18-f9a1-11e4-9030-b4732caefe81_story.html"
"What distinguished the socialists from their contemporaries during the Progressive era and the New Deal was their belief that capitalism was inherently unjust and unsustainable. But the very reforms pushed through by European socialists and their American socialist, progressive and liberal counterparts created a more social capitalism — a capitalism with unions, social insurance and prohibitions on speculation — that was to prove remarkably sustainable for a time. In the years after World War II, the socialist parties of Europe and American socialist intellectuals such as Michael Harrington no longer advocated nationalizing the means of production. They advocated, rather, for an expanded social rights agenda — free medical care, for instance — and civil rights. A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin and Martin Luther King Jr. — respectively, the architect, the organizer and the visionary of the 1963 March on Washington — were democratic socialists.","1008","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-democratic-socialist-campaign-its-about-time/2015/05/14/05634e18-f9a1-11e4-9030-b4732caefe81_story.html"
"But the more egalitarian U.S. economy of the postwar decades has given way to a far grimmer one today, in which new jobs pay poverty wages and and just two art auctions at Christie’s this week can entice the rich to part with more than $1.3 billion. Debs would find much of today’s United States disorientingly familiar. Young Americans, who may have heard their nation once had a middle-class majority but have never experienced it themselves, may have no clear idea what socialism is, but they have a grimly accurate read on contemporary capitalism. A Pew poll showed that while 46 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds had a positive view of capitalism, 47 percent had a negative view — and when asked about socialism, 49 percent saw it positively and 43 percent negatively.","1009","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-democratic-socialist-campaign-its-about-time/2015/05/14/05634e18-f9a1-11e4-9030-b4732caefe81_story.html"
"Enter, stage left, Sen. Sanders. The independent from Vermont is not likely, putting it mildly, to displace Hillary Clinton as the Democratic front-runner, or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as the leader of U.S. liberalism, but in the best tradition of Debs and Thomas, he is advancing ideas that Democrats, Clinton included, may in time embrace. Sanders calls for Medicare for all and free higher education to be financed with higher taxes on the rich. Like Debs and Thomas, who won their highest votes in elections in which the tide was running left (for Debs, 1912, in which the victor was Woodrow Wilson; for Thomas, 1932, in which the victor was Franklin D. Roosevelt), Sanders is running while Democrats are again moving left in response to the deep dysfunctions of U.S. capitalism. In the past few weeks, leading Democratic think tanks have proposed establishing a public option for health care, national funding for state universities and higher Social Security benefits — policies distinctly more progressive than last year’s standard Democratic fare. Democratic city councils are raising the minimum wage and requiring paid sick days. On Tuesday, Senate Democrats brought the free-trade agreement with Pacific Rim nations to a shuddering, if provisional halt, pending the addition of legislation that pays more heed to the concerns of U.S. workers.","1010","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-democratic-socialist-campaign-its-about-time/2015/05/14/05634e18-f9a1-11e4-9030-b4732caefe81_story.html"
"Much of what Sanders champions is a slightly more social democratic version of the newly populist liberalism. He can make an even more helpful contribution by offering proposals to change our economic institutions in ways that re-socialize capitalism — rolling back the power that major shareholders wield over corporations, creating labor rights for workers in the gig economy, making businesses more answerable to their workers and consumers.","1011","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-democratic-socialist-campaign-its-about-time/2015/05/14/05634e18-f9a1-11e4-9030-b4732caefe81_story.html"

"Joe Trippi was the mastermind behind the rise of former Gov. Howard Dean in the 2004 Democratic presidential primary fight. Dean's candidacy -- premised on representing the ""Democratic wing of the Democratic party"" -- stoked massive grassroots energy and took the party establishment by storm. Sound familiar? I reached out to Joe to talk about the similarities -- and differences -- between what Dean did back then and what Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is doing right now. Our conversation, conducted by e-mail and edited only for grammar, is below.","August 12","1014","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"

Is there a key strain that runs from the Dean campaign directly through the Sanders bid?","1015","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"
"Trippi: I see more big differences than similarities between the Dean and Sanders campaigns. It starts with the structure of the race. We faced three establishment Democrats not one. John Kerry, Dick Gephardt and John Edwards were three strong candidacies that were splitting the vote and donor support of the party establishment in 2003. So when we started to move we actually took the lead in national polls and in each of the key states.","1016","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"
"Sanders faces a completely different problem. No one is splitting the party establishment with Hillary. She has it all to herself. When we were at 30 percent we had the lead. Sanders gets to 30 percent and he is still 25 points behind. The second structural difference in the race is born out of a similarity. Yes they both come from Vermont, a state that is mostly white. But Dean did not face in Kerry, Gephardt or Edwards any candidate that had a significant advantage or following in the African American community. In fact in poll after poll, Dean attracted more than his fair share of the black vote. Had we faced a Kennedy or a Clinton that would not have been the case. Sanders is going to have a much more difficult time overcoming Hillary's advantage in the African American community and that is eventually going to be a big problem as the campaign turns to South Carolina and beyond. In fact if he can't solve it, he can't win.","1017","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"
"So I think Sanders' path to the nomination is much more difficult than the path we faced in the Dean campaign in 2003. The biggest difference between them, and the one that could benefit Sanders, is that he isn't a threat to the Democratic establishment. They just don't see him becoming a threat to actually win the nomination. That's a good thing. Because when the establishment saw us as a threat to win the nomination they hit us with everything they had to stop us. No one in the party establishment is hacking away at Sanders. Yet.","1018","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"
"One thing I thing that I think is a key strain from 2003 through today, and we are seeing it in both parties, is how both party establishments are losing control of their nominating processes. The energy of the Dean Sleepless Summer tour in 2003 is very similar to the energy and sheer size of recent Sanders rallies this summer. Sanders, like Dean, is raising millions not from the establishment donors of the party but from small donors online. The party establishment can't stop that. We are seeing the same loss of control on the GOP side. It doesn't mean the establishments of the parties won't win, but it does mean they will no longer be able to stop every challenge. Witness Barack Obama 2008.","1019","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"

"Trippi: The war in Iraq was a driving issue in 2003. Kerry, Edwards and Gephardt had all voted for the war. People forget now that when Dean launched his campaign for president, 80 percent of the American people supported the war. It takes a hell of a lot of courage for a candidate for president to take the 20 percent side of that kind of an issue but Dean did. Dean was a Democrat who would stand up to George W, Bush when other Democrats were voting to go to war. That's far different than what Sanders is saying today. We have had a Democratic president for two terms. It's tough to argue to Democratic primary voters that Obama wasn't left enough on the economy. Or that you are going to do more on income inequality than Hillary. Sanders is tapping into the voters' angst that the system is rigged -- and it's clearly powerful and driving amazing energy into his campaign -- but it's different fuel.","1021","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"
"I am not sure it says anything about Hillary. Kerry received 251 electoral votes against Bush with a message that had nothing to do with anything Dean said. I am not sure whoever the GOP nominee is will be as strong as George W. Bush running for re-election while prosecuting a war that was popular at the time.","1022","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"

"Trippi: People get more pragmatic the closer they get to an actual vote. We drew large crowds and lots of energy but there was always a fear among the party establishment that we couldn't beat Bush. In the end those kinds of doubts always move voters back towards the establishment's candidate. Obama overcame this fear win when he won in Iowa. Sanders will have to win a state early. Again the key for Sanders may be that the establishment doesn't fear him. If they hadn't feared us (the Gore endorsement made sure they did) and they hadn't all gone on the attack, we probably would have won Iowa.","1024","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"

"Trippi: No, the establishment and media are not taking Sanders seriously enough. The GOP establishment and media are not taking their insurgents serious enough. When Gary Hart took second to Walter Mondale in Iowa in 1984, Hart launched like a rocket. But people mailed checks in those days -- and banks in Denver placed 7 day holds on all out of state checks back then. Today if one of these candidates surprises, millions will pour in a few hours.","1026","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"
"The establishments in both parties have no idea how vulnerable they are. They may laugh at the Sanders' candidacy today. I may think he has a tough path to the nomination, but the biggest mistake you can make in 2016 is underestimating your opponent. Both party establishments are not only underestimating the possibility of falling to an insurgent within their party but the very real possibility of a successful independent candidacy emerging. It's going to happen the only question is when. 2016 or 2020?","1027","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/12/what-the-man-behind-howard-dean-thinks-of-bernie-sanders-rise/"

"Trippi: I think its likely that 35 percent is Sanders' ceiling [nationally]. It will take time and expanding his ability to grow support in the African American community and other minority voters to get much above that. If Joe Biden or someone else was in the race splitting the establishment vote like we had in 2003, 35 percent might be enough.

Indeed, we have to hope they prod each other to go beyond their current positions on redistributing power and income, for the forces that have diminished the middle class are so entrenched that rebuilding a vibrant economy requires policies more radical than either candidate has yet embraced.","1042","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/on-big-business-clinton-moves-left-of-sanders/2015/07/30/203e3ba2-3624-11e5-9739-170df8af8eb9_story.html"
"Last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development published a study of the distribution of income growth from 1976 through 2007 in each of its 34 member nations (those with the world’s most advanced economies). Nearly half the income growth in the United States during those three decades went to the wealthiest 1 percent, while the bottom 90 percent got less than one-fifth of that growth — a level of inequality vastly greater than that of any remotely comparable nation, and one that largely explains why so many Americans felt compelled to take on so much debt. Since the recovery began in 2009, as surveys of U.S. tax returns by University of California at Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez document, all the income growth has gone to the top 1 percent.","1043","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/on-big-business-clinton-moves-left-of-sanders/2015/07/30/203e3ba2-3624-11e5-9739-170df8af8eb9_story.html"
"An imbalance that profound requires the kind of redistributionist tax policies that Sanders advocates, the corporate reconfigurations that Clinton calls for, the boost to unionization that both demand — and then some. Using the tax code to incentivize profit sharing and investment and penalize the stock buybacks that reward short-term investors is all well and good, but why stop there? Why not use the tax code to incentivize practices that increase worker power, such as dividing corporate boards between worker and management representatives? Why not simply mandate that division for all sizable corporations, as Germany does? Why not require employers to pay into a fund that provides benefits for their workers who — because they’re independent contractors, or temps, or employed by subcontractors — can’t get the insurance they’d qualify for if they did the same work as employees? Alternatively, why not decouple benefits from jobs altogether and provide them socially?","1044","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/on-big-business-clinton-moves-left-of-sanders/2015/07/30/203e3ba2-3624-11e5-9739-170df8af8eb9_story.html"
"Republicans routinely posit that an emphasis on redistribution would inhibit growth. Indeed, this falsest of choices fairly defines Republican economics. Having most (and lately, all) the growth go to the top 1 percent, however, plainly diminishes everyone else’s purchasing power, which diminishes investment, which diminishes growth. Clinton and Sanders — and their fellow Democratic candidates Martin O’Malley and Jim Webb — understand this, which is why they need to go beyond their commendable positions by proposing the fundamental changes we need to create a more balanced and prosperous economy.","1045","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/on-big-business-clinton-moves-left-of-sanders/2015/07/30/203e3ba2-3624-11e5-9739-170df8af8eb9_story.html"

"It’s not clear how much sympathy that will drum up for Sanders, but he can now claim she’s threatened by him.

"First, Sanders might start hitting her hard for her cronyism (The Huffington Post points out: “The newest hire for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign is a longtime strategist who played a key role in her 2008 primary defeat while working for then-Sen. Barack Obama. He’s also a Washington lobbyist who lobbied the State Department — led, at the time, by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — on behalf of the company seeking to build the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.”) That means going after the conflicts of interest, the speeches for hedge funds, the anti-woman regimes who donated to her foundation and more.","1076","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/25/hillary-clinton-has-to-attack-bernie-sanders/"
"There is also the matter of her cronies. Sid Blumenthal found a back door into the State Department while getting paid by the “charitable” foundation. Hillaryland regulars Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin remained on the government payroll while working outside government (in the case of Mills, her status was not previously disclosed). The operating rules in Clinton’s orbit seem to be: Let the rules be damned, ignore conflicts and take the money and run. Not exactly the model of public service we expect.","1077","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/25/hillary-clinton-has-to-attack-bernie-sanders/"

"Second, carrying around the empty chair and excoriating her for refusal to engage and enunciate her views is another possible Sanders tactic. Clinton, to the extent she has views, surely does not want to reveal any controversial ones that would make either her nomination or general election candidacy more problematic. The progress Sanders has made in the polls bashing her for taking no definitive stance on trade may encourage him to keep at it.","1079","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/25/hillary-clinton-has-to-attack-bernie-sanders/"
"Third, how much higher can Sanders go before a bigger name (Vice President Joe Biden? Michael Bloomberg?) decides to get into the race? That might come after a primary or two, or it could come this summer. Watching Clinton dodge and weave, leaving the president out to dry on trade must be infuriating to a guy like Biden who has spent seven years loyally serving the president, and in fact goading him into more liberal positions (e.g., gay marriage).","1080","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/25/hillary-clinton-has-to-attack-bernie-sanders/"
"Clinton remains the prohibitive favorite, but to the extent Bernie Sanders of all people can inflict real damage or draw bigger fish into the pond, he remains a danger to Hillaryland.

"Fiermonte said large venues can cost as much as $15,000 to rent, an expense that organizers believe is offset by collecting contact information from those in attendance and using that information to build Sanders’s donor base.

"In 2005, he voted to shield manufacturers from lawsuits brought by victims of gun violence. Consumers injured by dangerous products regularly bring similar lawsuits against other kinds of manufacturers. The firearms industry, along with the NRA and other gun-rights groups, argued that manufacturers shouldn't be held responsible for the actions of violent criminals with guns. Congress agreed, preventing victims from suing firearms makers.","1162","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/13/why-the-most-liberal-candidate-for-president-opposes-strict-gun-control/"

"Yet while he has been a supporter of gun rights, he has also taken plenty of criticism from Second Amendment groups for his positions in favor of other gun-control measures. He's consistently supported a ban on assault weapons. After the massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, Sanders reversed his position on the Brady Bill the next year and voted to expand background checks. He didn't seem to fully embrace the new legislation, however. ""If you passed the strongest gun-control legislation tomorrow, I don't think it will have a profound effect,"" he said.

"In a recent response to written questions, Sanders's campaign said that the candidate had learned to shoot a rifle as a Boy Scout, but that he doesn't own any guns.

"As a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sanders will likely adopt a similar strategy on guns.

This from the Denver Post:","1186","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"
"And as the story notes, while this crowd was the largest for Sanders since he began running for president last month, it's far from the only big crowd he has drawn. More than 3,000 people were at a Sanders event in Minneapolis at the end of May. Earlier this month, more than 700 people were at a Sanders rally at Drake University in Iowa. In early June, an overflow crowd turned out to hear Sanders in Keene, New Hampshire.","1187","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"
"Sanders, himself, has been taken aback by the size of the crowds coming to see him. ""If you were to ask me a couple of months ago whether we would have larger crowds than any other candidate out there, I would not have told you that that would be the case,"" he told NPR.","1188","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"

"Here's what we know for sure: That Sanders -- and the populist, anti-big business message he is championing -- is driving more excitement in the Democratic base than I certainly thought it would. While polling suggested that there was a growing bloc of liberals who wanted a liberal candidate to fully embrace their agenda, that the rallying behind Sanders among that group has happened so quickly is surprising.","1190","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"
"We also know that crowd size is one -- if far from the only -- indicator of organic energy in politics. If 700 people are willing to come see Sanders speak in June 2015 in Iowa, it's not that hard to imagine some decent portion of those people will also be willing to turn out and caucus for Sanders come Feb. 1, 2016.","1191","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"
"Crowd size also can function as a leading indicator of a growing movement -- a sort of early-warning system that something is brewing out in the country that hasn't made its way to the political class back in Washington, D.C. I remember vividly during the 2006 election cycle when a freshman Senator named Barack Obama was the most sought-after surrogate for Democratic candidates in tough races. And how everywhere he went -- even in conservative-minded states like West Virginia -- thousands of people showed up to catch a glimpse of him.","1192","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"
"Not everyone knew it then -- and Hillary Clinton was one of the unknowing -- but the energy around Obama in 2006 was a precursor to a movement that swamped the former first lady and overwhelmed John McCain in 2008.","1193","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"

"Here's what gives me pause on drawing that conclusion: Aside from Obama, the candidate in recent years most able to generate genuine and organic enthusiasm (as well as big crowds) was former Texas representative Ron Paul. I still remember vividly how the Paul forces overwhelmed virtually every Republican candidate forum and debate in which he appeared. Walking around the Ames Straw Poll (R.I.P.) in August 2007, I was convinced that Paul had a chance to shock the world (okay, the political world) with a stronger-than-expected finish. He finished fifth. And he went on to never win a primary or a caucus in either his 2008 and 2012 presidential candidacies.","1195","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"
"For Paul, the crowds he generated were misleading. Yes, every single person who turned out for him was willing to do anything to see him elected. The problem? The people who showed up were almost all of the people that were for Paul. As in, the energy and excitement he generated was real but it wasn't nearly widespread enough to elect him or even come close to electing him.","1196","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"
"Think of it this way: Paul was the most popular band in your high school. EVERYONE loved them and thought they were going to be the biggest thing ever. Everyone in your high school. Not everyone in the world. Obama in 2006, on the other hand, was like seeing the Beatles at the Cavern Club in 1961. There was something coming, something big, and though you might not have been able to grasp then how big it was going to be, you knew you were there at the beginning of something. (Note for haters: I am not saying Obama is the Beatles. I am simply using a metaphor.)","1197","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"
"So, is Sanders 2016 more Obama circa 2006 or Paul in 2008/2012? It's too early to know. As in, if Sanders is drawing 700 people at every event he does in Iowa and New Hampshire for the next six months, then we are having a different conversation that day than we are having today.","1198","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"
"My guess -- and at this point it is nothing more than a guess -- is that Sanders will wind up being a slightly broader-based Paul. He will be able to raise more money than most people guess and will continue to drive total loyalty within 20 percent (or so) of the Democratic electorate. That's enough to put a slight scare into Clinton. Nothing more.","1199","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/5000-people-came-to-hear-bernie-sanders-speak-in-denver-and-that-means/"

"Bernie Sanders, the socialist senator and Democratic presidential candidate from Vermont, says spiraling college tuition is “a national disgrace.” He’s running on a promise of free in-state tuition at all public colleges and universities, to be paid for by a new federal tax on financial transactions, including stock, bond and derivative trades.","May 21","1211","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/college-doesnt-need-to-be-free/2015/05/21/4453fc94-ff0f-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html"

"Tuition increases have outstripped inflation at both public and private nonprofit institutions for many years. Though the recent, dramatic rise in tuition at public universities reflects post-recession budget cutbacks by some states, the reasons for the long-term trend are complex.","1213","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/college-doesnt-need-to-be-free/2015/05/21/4453fc94-ff0f-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html"
"Economist William Baumol has famously argued that college-level instruction inherently requires large inputs of highly skilled labor, making it relatively resistant to automation and hence to productivity increases. In that way, higher ed is like health care. And, as with health care, the government has responded with a fragmented, opaque array of subsidies, much of which get captured by service providers and added to their cost base — rather than improving affordability as intended.","1214","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/college-doesnt-need-to-be-free/2015/05/21/4453fc94-ff0f-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html"
"Sanders’s solution, which he says would cost the Treasury $47 billion in its first year, amounts to a single-payer system for higher ed — with pros and cons analogous to those of such a system for health care. There’s a certain appeal in replacing the current, convoluted array of grants and loans, funneled through individuals, with just one revenue stream directed at institutions. (Well, 1½: Sanders would have Washington pay two-thirds of the funding and state governments the rest.) Setting a single out-of-pocket price — zero — would indeed make it easier to attend school.","1215","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/college-doesnt-need-to-be-free/2015/05/21/4453fc94-ff0f-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html"
"Over time, however, the Sanders plan might make U.S. higher education more accessible but less excellent. Having ruled out price as a means of allocating scarce educational resources, his plan would have to rely on aggressive administrative controls, lest students flood the system and drive up costs — requiring further federal subsidies.","1216","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/college-doesnt-need-to-be-free/2015/05/21/4453fc94-ff0f-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html"
"The case of tuition-free Germany, which Sanders holds up as a model, confirms this. Centralized budgeting by state education authorities is key to that country’s system. Alas, as University of Albany higher-ed policy analyst Ben Wildavsky explains, “Government funds become spread too thin. That reduces quality and often limits capacity. As a result, well-off students, who tend to be better prepared academically, are more likely to get scarce spaces.” Overall, German institutions are considered good, not great; few show up on global “top 50” lists, for what that’s worth.","1217","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/college-doesnt-need-to-be-free/2015/05/21/4453fc94-ff0f-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html"
"Germany also rations access to higher ed through tracking — selecting a college-bound minority at an early age while putting everyone else on course to less-exalted training. This is one reason that fewer German youth finish college than do American youth, despite not having to pay tuition. At the same time, Germany tends to accumulate “eternal students”; its now-abandoned recent experiment with charging tuition was an attempt to make them either graduate or leave.","1218","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/college-doesnt-need-to-be-free/2015/05/21/4453fc94-ff0f-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html"
"If Sanders favors either German-style government management of university budgets or tracking, I haven’t heard about it, though he would eventually cap federal grants to states at the 2019 median. To the contrary, his Senate bill bars state “policies to reduce enrollment.” He even mandates steps that might increase costs, such as replacing adjunct professors with tenure-track faculty.","1219","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/college-doesnt-need-to-be-free/2015/05/21/4453fc94-ff0f-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html"

"Which brings us back to Baumol’s theory that college costs are doomed to rise faster than inflation because higher ed can’t readily be automated. Universities can, and should, test that proposition, using Internet technology; and they will, unless a guaranteed flow of government money from Sanders removes incentives to innovate.","1221","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/college-doesnt-need-to-be-free/2015/05/21/4453fc94-ff0f-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html"
"These trade-offs might be justifiable if the moral case for “free,” as opposed to affordable, tuition were clear. It’s not.

"Vermont Teddy Bear now sells a charming “Bernie Bear,” designed to resemble newly minted candidate Bernie Sanders. “A passionate, blunt speaker; he’ll quickly tell you, ‘I am not a circus Bear, I am not a dancing Bear, I am not a toy Bear.’ Arrives wearing a gray suit, white shirt, blue tie, glasses, campaign pin and iconic unruly hair. Handmade in Vermont, USA using the softest fur we can get our paws on and 100% recycled stuffing. Guaranteed for life. Receives free universal Bear Care at our Teddy Bear Hospital.” (Leaving aside the nightmare scenarios for teddy bears denied care because of preexisting conditions (loose button?), this made me wonder what teddy bears for the other candidates might look like.

"Over the weekend, Sanders spoke on gun control and the tax-exempt status of churches, and if you were hearing him for the first time, you might think he was a Republican. He defended gun owners on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" saying 99.9 percent of them obey the law and that gun manufacturers shouldn't be held responsible for murderers ""any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer.""","1242","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/why-we-shouldnt-call-bernie-sanders-a-liberal/"

"Of course, neither of these positions necessarily run counter to the Democratic Party's principles -- Hillary Clinton isn't going after law-abiding gun owners, and Martin O'Malley isn't campaigning on taking away churches' tax-exempt status -- and Sanders's comments came in the context of his liberal bona fides, which he also mentioned. For example, he has voted to ban semiautomatic assault weapons and create instant background checks, and he voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, which was signed into law in 1996 by Democratic President Bill Clinton.","1244","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/why-we-shouldnt-call-bernie-sanders-a-liberal/"
"But there are certain things that might complicate Sanders for those on the left -- and it wasn't just this weekend, either. In 1993, as a member of the House, he voted against the Brady bill, which required federal background checks for most gun purchases. He also voted to allow people to transport guns on Amtrak, and he previously said he didn't think stricter gun control would end mass shootings.

Other Democrats opposed the final bill, as Sanders did, but almost all who did so came from the more moderate wing of the party.","1246","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/why-we-shouldnt-call-bernie-sanders-a-liberal/"
"Sanders might just become some GOP-leaning voters' favorite 2016 Democrat -- and not just because he's giving Hillary Clinton a tough time. It's not hard to see some of his positions appealing to more libertarian voters like former Ron Paul fans who prefer Sanders over Rand Paul. His arguments for a middle ground on some of our most controversial social issues also could appeal to voters frustrated by hyper-partisan politics.","1247","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/why-we-shouldnt-call-bernie-sanders-a-liberal/"
"He has surprised even himself with the turnout he's getting at some early campaign events. The more than 2,500 people who showed up to a Friday rally in Iowa were part of the largest crowd for any candidate in Iowa this cycle. But he's not just spending all his time in Iowa or New Hampshire. Sanders has had rallies in Colorado and Wisconsin, and he told The Nation that he believes candidates should have a 50-state campaign strategy, rattling off red states he thinks Democrats, as ""the party of working people,"" should campaign in, including Mississippi, South Carolina and Alabama. On Monday, he drew 7,500 people closer to home in Portland, Maine.","1248","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/why-we-shouldnt-call-bernie-sanders-a-liberal/"

"Fifteen percent, of course, is still 42 points behind Clinton. Which means that Sanders remains a non-threat to seriously challenge the frontrunner for the nomination at this point.

"Liberty was founded in 1971 by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a televangelist and icon of the religious right. Originally just a small Baptist seminary in the foothills of Lynchburg, Va., by 1984 it had become a fully accredited university, part of a religious empire that included Falwell’s Thomas Road Baptist megachurch, the Moral Majority lobbying group and the “Old Time Gospel Hour,” his syndicated radio and TV ministry.","1309","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/07/why-liberty-university-is-requiring-its-students-to-attend-a-bernie-sanders-speech/"
"“It’s our goal,” Falwell said of the school in 1985, “to be the Harvard of academics, the Notre Dame of athletics and the Brigham Young of religious schools to evangelical and fundamentalist girls and boys.”","1310","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/07/why-liberty-university-is-requiring-its-students-to-attend-a-bernie-sanders-speech/"
"The rules in the early days were restrictive. Interracial dating was briefly banned (by 1985 it was allowed, but the school would call both students’ parents to make sure they were all right with it), as were jeans, drugs and gatherings of members of the opposite sex in any unlit part of campus. Demonstrations weren’t allowed unless approved by the administration. Twice weekly attendance at Thomas Road Baptist Church services was absolutely mandatory. And every student and staff member was required to sign a statement agreeing to abide by the school’s doctrinal views, which covered topics both religious and political.","1311","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/07/why-liberty-university-is-requiring-its-students-to-attend-a-bernie-sanders-speech/"
"Those rules appealed to some students — “Christians are supposed to be different,” 18-year-old Michelle Brown, a freshman in 1985, told The Washington Post at the time — but they were often at odds with Falwell’s ambitions for expansion. In 1993, the school agreed to drop many of its most stringent religious requirements in order to keep receiving state tuition assistance grants.","1312","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/07/why-liberty-university-is-requiring-its-students-to-attend-a-bernie-sanders-speech/"
"And despite its intense conservatism, the school was unusually open to hearing opposing viewpoints. Falwell routinely invited Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) to speak on campus. Kennedy gave a famous speech on religious tolerance at a convocation more than 40 years ago.","1313","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/07/why-liberty-university-is-requiring-its-students-to-attend-a-bernie-sanders-speech/"

"By that point, the student body had grown to nearly 10,000, but the school was also $30 million in debt. Falwell’s son and successor as chancellor, Jerry Falwell Jr., had a revised vision: transforming Liberty from a relatively niche religious school into a mega-university. In less than 10 years, Falwell Jr. has made the school the largest private nonprofit university in the country, with $1.2 billion in reserves that rivals the endowments of many much older institutions. That influx of cash has been powered by the school’s more than 100,000 on-campus and online students — 10 times the enrollment of only a decade before.","1315","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/07/why-liberty-university-is-requiring-its-students-to-attend-a-bernie-sanders-speech/"

"But expansion, for many reasons, has required a slight easing of the rules. For one thing, there was only a limited number of 18-year-olds whose idea of a great college experience was one where no movies rated higher than G were shown (now they’re allowed to watch anything below R). The new tens of thousands of students who attend are no longer required to agree to Liberty’s doctrinal statement, though they are expected to commit to a Christian way of life.","1317","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/07/why-liberty-university-is-requiring-its-students-to-attend-a-bernie-sanders-speech/"

"The school unquestionably remains a hub of fervent religious and political conservatism. The student code of conduct is explicit about its goal of helping students become “more Christ-like.” It bans gambling, “horseplay” and attendance at a dance. Larger infractions — having an abortion, possession of alcohol, involvement with witchcraft and premarital sex, along with more traditional crimes such as assault and theft — are punishable by administrative withdrawal.","1324","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/07/why-liberty-university-is-requiring-its-students-to-attend-a-bernie-sanders-speech/"
"And Liberty has become a near-mandatory stop on the campaign route for conservative candidates.

"That's what you call consistency -- but in 27 years, the boundaries of debate about Israel have shifted. Sanders was born before the establishment of Israel, and spent some of his youth on a holy land kibbutz.

"Earlier this month, a group of activist teachers wrote an open letter to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination against front-runner Hillary Clinton and who has gained some unexpected support around the country.

"But during the debate last month in the Senate about legislation that seeks to rewrite NCLB and slash federal involvement in education, he supported a measure known as the Murphy amendment, which would have kept alive some of NCLB’s punitive, federally mandated actions against schools considered to be failing based on standardized test scores.","1387","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/08/21/activist-teachers-challenge-sen-bernie-sanders-on-corporate-school-reform/"

"Bernie Sanders's critics say he supports stricter rules on guns only when it's convenient. For his part, the Democratic presidential candidate insists that he is a reliable ally of gun-control advocates.","August 31","1391","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/31/bernie-sanders-tries-to-clarify-his-record-on-gun-control/"
"""I've been strong on this issue,"" he said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday, citing his votes in favor of background checks at gun shows and a ban on sales of semi-automatic weapons.","1392","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/31/bernie-sanders-tries-to-clarify-his-record-on-gun-control/"
"Sanders did take those votes, as well as many others in favor of stricter gun control. Over his long career, though, he's also stood against gun control on several crucial pieces of legislation, as this voting history compiled by the Tampa Bay Times shows. Sanders did not discuss those votes in Sunday's television interview.","1393","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/31/bernie-sanders-tries-to-clarify-his-record-on-gun-control/"
"Sanders said he voted for instant background checks, which he called ""probably the most important thing we can do."" Yet many gun-control advocates favor longer waiting periods to instant background checks to allow for the authorities to more thoroughly vet someone who is trying to buy a weapon. Current law requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation to approve or deny a gun purchase within three days. Dylann Roof, accused of killing nine people at a church in Charleston, S.C. in July, was able to buy a gun because it took the feds more than three days -- the legal maximum -- to determine whether he was eligible.","1394","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/31/bernie-sanders-tries-to-clarify-his-record-on-gun-control/"
"During the debate over the Brady handgun bill, which established the background-check system, Sanders did vote in favor of instant background checks on an amendment. Ultimately, though, he voted against the Brady legislation, which imposed a five-day waiting period. Former aides told the Times that Sanders's aim was to represent Vermont, a sparsely populated state where many people own guns for hunting. Sanders's constituents there did not want a waiting period for gun purchases, they said.","1395","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/31/bernie-sanders-tries-to-clarify-his-record-on-gun-control/"
"Gun-control advocates were also frustrated when Sanders voted for a 2005 bill to bar victims of gun violence from suing firearms manufacturers. Although legal experts say that such lawsuits would have been unlikely to succeed in most cases, since the manufacturers could argue that a third party was responsible, the bill still gave the industry a level of legal protection unique among makers of dangerous consumer products.","1396","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/31/bernie-sanders-tries-to-clarify-his-record-on-gun-control/"
"And a year later, Sanders voted to make it harder for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to identify and shut down unscrupulous gun dealers. While data on the black market for guns is limited, an investigation by The Washington Post, among other studies, has found that most guns used in crimes come from just a few gun stores -- about 1 percent of licensed dealers. The bureau lacks the resources and the legal authority to prevent those dealers from doing business.","1397","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/31/bernie-sanders-tries-to-clarify-his-record-on-gun-control/"
"On Sunday, Sanders said that the way to reduce gun violence is to improve the country's mental health system. While it is true that the mentally ill are more violent on average than the general population, there aren't many people who are mentally ill, and only a small fraction of overall violence can be blamed on mental disorders, psychologists say.","1398","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/31/bernie-sanders-tries-to-clarify-his-record-on-gun-control/"
"""If we were able to magically cure schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression, that would be wonderful, but overall violence would go down by only about 4 percent,"" Duke University's Jeffrey Swanson told ProPublica last year.","1399","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/31/bernie-sanders-tries-to-clarify-his-record-on-gun-control/"

"“A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy,” the 31-year-old author wrote, as Mother Jones reported. “A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously.”","1460","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/01/so-you-might-not-want-to-read-bernie-sanderss-43-year-old-sex-column/"

"“This was a dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication intended to attack gender stereotypes in the 1970s, and it looks as stupid today as it was then,” Sanders’s spokesman, Michael Briggs, said in a statement, as USA Today reported. “When Bernie got into this race, he understood that there would be efforts to distract voters and the press away from the real issues confronting the nation today. He’s determined to run a campaign that takes on the big problems facing the American people, and not a campaign of salacious gossip and innuendo.”","1464","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/01/so-you-might-not-want-to-read-bernie-sanderss-43-year-old-sex-column/"
"But on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday, Sanders called it “a piece of fiction that I wrote in 1972, I think. … It was very poorly written and if you read it, what it was dealing with was gender stereotypes, why some men like to oppress women, why other women like to be submissive, you know, something like ‘Fifty Shades of Grey.'”","1465","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/01/so-you-might-not-want-to-read-bernie-sanderss-43-year-old-sex-column/"

"“Men and women — both are losers,” he wrote. “Women adapt themselves to fill the needs of men, and men adapt themselves to fill the needs of women.

No more!”","1469","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/01/so-you-might-not-want-to-read-bernie-sanderss-43-year-old-sex-column/"

"Responses to Sanders’s decades-old writing were divided. The reliably liberal Mother Jones called the piece “a stream-of-consciousness essay on the nature of male-female sexual dynamics” that “reflected his affinity for Sigmund Freud,” offering it as an example of the candidate’s “aimless” period before his evolution as a politician. And Jezebel, though it called the work a “creepy little essay,” said any brewing controversy was unwarranted.","1474","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/01/so-you-might-not-want-to-read-bernie-sanderss-43-year-old-sex-column/"

"“Thus far, Sanders’ abuse fantasies and his own fantasy that women dream of rape by multiple men have been covered by precisely zero mainstream news outlets,” the Web site wrote. “Mother Jones didn’t even bother quoting the essay directly, instead choosing to embed a screenshot. That’s because rape fantasies are funny and charming when they come from an aged socialist hippie.” (That last sentence was sarcastic.)","1477","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/01/so-you-might-not-want-to-read-bernie-sanderss-43-year-old-sex-column/"
"As reds and blues line-up on predictable sides of this small-time campaign dust-up nine months before the Iowa caucuses, perhaps all should remember that life is fleeting.

"On Sunday, Clinton had something to say — while still leaving herself plenty of wiggle room. She told a crowd at the first Iowa rally of her campaign that Obama should address the concerns of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Democratic rank and file in Congress, who want the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement to include better protections for American workers. Without improvements, she said, “there should be no deal.”","1483","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/on-the-trail-in-iowa-clinton-and-sanders-make-trade-a-hot-issue/2015/06/14/f86c1c68-12cc-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html"

"Late Sunday, Sanders slammed Clinton’s indecisiveness and said she should take a clear stance on fast-track authority. “I am not clear, nor do I believe the American people are clear, as to what Secretary Clinton’s position is.

"Once she arrived, Clinton stirred her supporters with partisan slams against Republicans — on tax policies, climate change and gay rights.

"“We once led the world in the percentage of our people with a college degree, now we are in 12th place.” Sanders said. “Countries like Germany, Denmark, Sweden and many more are providing free or inexpensive higher education for their young people.

"Sanders estimates that his plan would cost $70 billion per year -- about $10 billion more than president Obama's proposal for free community college. States under Sanders's plan would have to put up $1 for every $2 the federal government ponies up, shifting more of the cost of public higher education to Washington. The federal share of the expense would be offset by imposing a tax on transactions by hedge funds, investment houses and other Wall Street firms.","1539","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/19/sen-bernie-sanders-wants-free-tuition-at-four-year-public-colleges-heres-why-it-wont-work/"
"To qualify for federal funding, states would need to maintain spending on their higher education systems, academic instruction and need-based financial aid. Sanders would also have colleges reduce their reliance on low-paid adjunct faculty, hire new faculty and provide professional development for professors. No funding under his plan could be use to pay for administrator salaries, merit-based financial aid or the construction of stadiums or student centers.","1540","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/19/sen-bernie-sanders-wants-free-tuition-at-four-year-public-colleges-heres-why-it-wont-work/"

"But so much of what Sanders is calling for would take a level of enforcement and compliance that would be difficult to achieve, said Iris Palmer, a senior policy analyst at the New America Foundation.

"Another hurdle is sustaining state investment, which rises and falls the economy. A big part of the reason public colleges are so expensive now is because states slashed higher education budgets during recessions and never fully made up for the loss and schools raised tuition to compensate. While some states might be enticed by the promise of federal aid, others may continue to treat higher education as a discretionary expense.","1544","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/19/sen-bernie-sanders-wants-free-tuition-at-four-year-public-colleges-heres-why-it-wont-work/"

To the first point, we can look at Michael McDonald's U.S. Elections Project, which estimated the size of the voting-eligible population at 227 million for last year's election. In 2012, 58 percent of eligible voters voted, so let's say that there are about 132 million voters in the United States who will vote in next year's general.

In hopes of trying to understand more about the Sanders' phenomenon, I reached out to Chris Graff, the longtime Vermont bureau chief for the Associated Press and author of ""Dateline Vermont"", to help fill in some of the gaps in the Sanders' story. Our interview, conducted via e-mail and edited only for grammar, is below.","August 20","1578","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/20/bernie-sanders-is-the-uncola-of-american-politics/"

"I did think in 2003 and 2004 that Bernie must have been incredulous (and perhaps a bit envious) that Howard Dean, one of Vermont’s most fiscally conservative governors in history, vaulted to the top of the 2004 Democratic presidential race as a populist, anti-establishment candidate [by] telling voters, “You have the power!” That’s been Bernie’s role since his early political races in the 1970s as a gadfly candidate of the Liberty Union party.","1581","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/20/bernie-sanders-is-the-uncola-of-american-politics/"
"I certainly did not expect Bernie to do as well as he has. There is no doubt he has a message that resonates with the times but I thought his red-hot style would not play as well on the presidential stage. Bernie lectures. He does not pamper. He does everything on his terms. But somehow the things I considered negatives are positives today.","1582","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/20/bernie-sanders-is-the-uncola-of-american-politics/"

"GRAFF: He operated under the radar, running as an independent, weaving together a coalition of people who felt left out by the long-time Democratic incumbent. He won by 10 votes in a four-way race. No one at the time saw that win coming. One of his key issues was to oppose the mayor’s plan to raise residential property taxes. He opposed a private developer’s plan to build hotels and condos on the waterfront. He ran against the “Old Boys” network that had governed Burlington for decades.","1584","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/20/bernie-sanders-is-the-uncola-of-american-politics/"

"GRAFF: Incredibly successful. The origins of almost everything great in Burlington today can be traced back to Bernie’s tenure as mayor. When he was elected in 1981 many city leaders feared he would care more about foreign policy (his team and his supporters were known as ""Sanderistas"") than city matters. But he was laser-focused on fixing potholes and economic development and rebuilding the waterfront and saving the downtown and providing arts and developing programs for children. Today Burlington ranks as one of the most livable cities in the nation.

"GRAFF: Bernie is the Uncola of national politics. Remember 7-Up’s masterful marketing strategy to separate it from Coke and Pepsi? The lemon-lime soft drink became the “Uncola: tart, crisp, clear” and was branded as the exact opposite of the two sweet, brown colas. Call central casting for a presidential candidate and the last person they would send you is a rumpled, mad-as-hell, impatient Brooklyn native with the air of an absent-minded professor. But today the Bernie brand is hot. His issues resonate, his anger matches the nation’s mood, his no-nonsense approach to politics is seen as a breath of fresh air.

"CLAREMONT, N.H. — It's a new riff in the hour-long stump speech of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- a slow burn. It begins with some ruminations about how ""people would have thought you were crazy"" if you said the United States in 2015 would have a black president. That's good, Sanders says — everybody give a pat on the back — but it shouldn't end the conversation.","August 2","1593","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/02/bernie-sanders-finds-his-blacklivesmatter-message/"
"""When I mention a few names, like Sandra Bland or Michael Brown or Rekia Boyd or Eric Garner or Walter Scott or Freddie Gray or Tamir Rice or recently Samuel DuBose, you know and I know that unarmed African Americans have been shot and killed by police forces in a way that never would have happened if they were white,"" Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, said at a campaign stop in Franklin, one of half a dozen appearances this weekend in the first primary state.

"Two weeks had passed since Black Lives Matter protesters crashed Sanders's speech at a progressive conference. They demanded that he stop talking generally about economic issues, stop talking about his role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, and say the names of black people killed by police. In their view, he whiffed — and that was before he skipped a meeting with organizers and sent his campaign manager as a ringer.","1596","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/02/bernie-sanders-finds-his-blacklivesmatter-message/"
"Sanders and his campaign learned quickly, and reached out to Black Lives Matter activists for insight on police reform. A week ago, the candidate gave the Southern Christian Leadership Conference his take on the death of Sandra Bland, and came out for mandatory body cameras on police officers. On Friday, when he addressed the national conference of the Urban League, Sanders rattled off the names of Brand, Brown, Boyd, Garner, Scott, Gray and Rice and presented his own changed standards. ""Violence and brutality of any kind, particularly at the hands of law enforcement sworn to protect and serve their communities, is unacceptable and must not be tolerated, he said. ""We must reform our criminal justice system. Black lives do matter, and we must value black lives.""","1597","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/02/bernie-sanders-finds-his-blacklivesmatter-message/"
"Over a long weekend of campaign stops in New Hampshire, Sanders honed that message. ""Police in Ferguson looked like an invading army,"" Sanders said in Franklin, referring to Ferguson, Mo., where Brown was killed. ""I was a mayor for eight years, and I know police a little bit. It's a very difficult job they've got. But when we do it the best way, we have community policing. Police are part of the community. They are not seen as oppressors.""","1598","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/02/bernie-sanders-finds-his-blacklivesmatter-message/"

""I had questions about whether it was a good idea to have body cameras on cops. No more. I'm sold on them.

"Pressuring politicians to the left was the original idea when Netroots Nation was founded in 2006 by readers of the Daily Kos group blog.

"Lenchner cited the collapse of ACORN, a community group that lost congressional funding after a conservative video sting, as a nadir of the Obama years. For some, the lowlights started earlier.

"According to many liberal activists, Obama’s centrist tendencies stopped him from seizing a moment. They said so at the time. In December 2009, Rolling Stone reporter Matt Taibbi accused the Obama administration of hiring “the very people who caused the crisis in the first place.” During the Affordable Care Act debate, many on the left insisted that the mandate-based compromise was not only worse but also less electorally viable than an expansion of Medicare or a “public option” to cover more people.","1647","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/liberal-activists-see-bernie-sanders-as-champion-for-causes-failed-by-obama/2015/07/19/8b5fc752-2e09-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html"

"The centrist Democrats called them crazy and self-destructive, a “professional left” — in the words of Obama’s first spokesman — with no grasp of strategy.

So you’re seeing people working in my state, all over this country, two jobs, they’re working three jobs, and they’re getting nowhere in a hurry. They’re working hard.

I have introduced legislation that would spend about $1 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. That would create about 13 million new jobs and maintain some jobs.

"While the law provides protections that no other industry has, courts have been reluctant to impose liability on manufacturers for third-party misuse of the product, said John Goldberg, Harvard Law School professor who specializes in product liability.

"As Sanders says, under the 2005 law, gun manufacturers are not held responsible if a murderer uses their gun to kill someone. But it does more than that. It gives broad protections to gun manufacturers, including for negligence, and can protect them from being sued in certain types of claims relating to the gun’s design. The Illinois case is one example where this immunity was cited to dismiss a lawsuit over the safety features of a gun that was accidentally fired by a boy. That type of technical protection would not apply to someone using a hammer.","1778","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/10/bernie-sanders-misleading-characterization-of-a-controversial-gun-law/"
"Further, Sanders’s comparison makes it seem as if this lawsuit came about solely because people were suing gun manufacturers for making guns that somehow fell in the hands of criminals. But that is not exactly the case. Advocates and cities were suing manufacturers alleging their actions were increasing the risk that guns would fall into criminal hands. The gun industry then responded with legislation to shut down those lawsuits. Sanders’s statement is misleading and a simplification of this complex case.","1779","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/10/bernie-sanders-misleading-characterization-of-a-controversial-gun-law/"

"This weekend, there were those fully sold on the self-described democratic socialist -- they were the ones wearing “Bernie for president” t-shirts and holding the “Feel the Bern” signs.

"Which is to say, places like Portland.","1861","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/13/bernie-sanders-is-winning-portlandia/"
"It's clear from national polls, such as the July Washington Post-ABC News poll that found Sanders trailing Clinton by nearly 50 percentage points, that Sanders appeals more than twice as much to liberals than he does to moderates, to whites than he does to non-whites and to college grads than to non-college grads. Wednesday's New Hampshire poll, from Franklin Pierce University and the Boston Herald, shows Sanders leading Clinton by 7 percentage points, a gap almost entirely explained by his advantage with voters with college degrees (but not advanced degrees).","1862","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/13/bernie-sanders-is-winning-portlandia/"
"Sanders' base support is, in a way, the reverse image of the one that has lifted Donald Trump to the top of Republican polls. Both men are often described as ""populists,"" but from different edges of the political spectrum; Trump, though, is connecting disproportionately well with white conservatives without college degrees.","1863","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/13/bernie-sanders-is-winning-portlandia/"
"So why is Portland so strong for Sanders? After all, there are a lot of college-educated Democratic voters around the country, many of them in places that haven't embraced his candidacy nearly as much. Portland is doing relatively well economically - it's hardly a hotbed for working-class grievance, compared to, say, Michigan - and its representatives in Congress tend to disagree with Sanders on, for example, giving trade promotion authority to President Obama.","1864","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/13/bernie-sanders-is-winning-portlandia/"
"What makes the Northwest - and the Northeast - different, Cohn said to me in an exchange this week, is that they produce a ""compound effect"" of support for Sanders.

"Steve Duin, a longtime metro columnist for the Oregonian newspaper, told me in a phone interview that the crowd on Sunday was ""sort of a great coalition between gray panthers and young idealists,"" all of them responding to Sanders' vision of a country where college and pre-school are free for everyone, hard-working Americans earn more per hour and billionaires wield less political influence.","1868","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/13/bernie-sanders-is-winning-portlandia/"

"There was hope in the crowd, he said, much as there was with the 75,000 Portlanders who turned out in 2008 to see then-candidate Barack Obama speak on the banks of the Willamette River. That hope has faded in many ways during Obama's presidency, even among liberals. But people in Portland - white, liberal, often very well-educated people - feel a gratitude for their quality of life, Duin said, and perhaps, a greater willingness to believe what Sanders is promising could be achieved, as expensive and unlikely as his plans might seem.","1870","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/13/bernie-sanders-is-winning-portlandia/"

"One reason is that Sanders’s history with third-party spoilage is not well-known. True, he won his first elective office, the mayoralty of Burlington, Vt., as an independent in a three-way race. Since then, Sanders has caucused with Democrats and worked to elect Democrats. He has flirted only briefly with fellow independents, and endorsed former policy adviser-turned Progressive Party politician Anthony Pollina in local runs.","1883","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/27/no-bernie-sanders-still-isnt-going-to-run-as-an-independent/"

"This was proven several times in the four presidential bids of Ralph Nader. Once, in 2000, Sanders introduced Nader at a speech in Vermont. Nader, he said, was “an old-fashioned guy who believes that maybe the ordinary people should be running this country rather than the multinational corporations.”","1885","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/27/no-bernie-sanders-still-isnt-going-to-run-as-an-independent/"
"But Sanders endorsed Vice President Al Gore over Nader. Four years later, he was one of the first people to condemn Nader’s do-over independent bid. “Virtually the entire progressive movement is not going to be supportive of Nader,” he told the Associated Press.","1886","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/27/no-bernie-sanders-still-isnt-going-to-run-as-an-independent/"
"Nader has always resented this. Sanders has never regretted it. A third-party national candidacy, he saw, was not a way to influence the debate from outside. It was a way to be asked, constantly, how he felt about spoiling things for the Democrats.","1887","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/27/no-bernie-sanders-still-isnt-going-to-run-as-an-independent/"
"Lots of progressives were chastened by the Nader experience, as nothing that the anti-politician promised came true. He suggested that a Gore defeat would heighten the contradictions between the parties -- a very Leninist argument. Within two years, half of the Democratic Party voted for the Iraq war. He hoped that the Green Party would become a force in politics, before his reluctant 2004 campaign split the party and erased most of its Nader-won gains.","1888","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/27/no-bernie-sanders-still-isnt-going-to-run-as-an-independent/"
"That's all a bit complicated. The second reason for the endless ""third party?"" noodling is the press's tendency to seek balance in stories between the two main parties.

"Overall, 82 percent of Democrats have a favorable view of Clinton, while 15 percent are unfavorable (a scant 3 percent have no opinion). Sanders's favorable rating is 36 percent among Democrats, with even more offering no opinion of him. Nearly a quarter -- 23 percent -- give Sanders negative marks.

"Given many Democrats simply don't know Sanders, the difference in views of him by subgroup are not gigantic. But lagging support from these groups could prove troublesome. Moderate and conservatives accounted for an average 53 percent of Democratic primary voters in 2008 across all states with exit polls, and non-college graduates accounted for 54 percent of the electorate.

"Dismissed only a couple months ago as a fringe candidate, the self-described democratic socialist senator from Vermont has proven in recent weeks that he is a contender to win the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.

"With Clinton falling in the polls and top Democrats increasingly concerned about her electability, Sanders is trying to take advantage by assembling a grass-roots machine modeled in part after Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign.

"The growing Sanders operation in the early states now nearly rivals the Clinton campaign. He has 54 paid staffers in Iowa and 38 in New Hampshire and dozens more coming on elsewhere, compared with 78 field staffers in Iowa and 50 in New Hampshire for Clinton.

"Sanders is also moving swiftly to expand his presence in South Carolina and Nevada and boost his standing among black and Latino voters. He is organizing in four states — Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont — with primaries or caucuses on March 1 that his team considers opportunities for victory.

"The Sanders campaign is training tens of thousands of volunteers to organize in their communities, expanding its social media presence and erecting an online fundraising apparatus to fully exploit every spurt of excitement.

"Sanders also is beginning to press the case to Democratic leaders that he, not Clinton, would be the strongest nominee because of the enthusiasm his populist message generates.

"Weaver and Devine laid out the Sanders playbook in a nearly 90-minute, on-the-record interview with The Washington Post this week at the campaign’s office on Capitol Hill.

"Sanders’s swift rise — the latest public polls show him leading Clinton in New Hampshire, statistically tied with her in Iowa and gaining on her nationally — has startled the political establishment. His unabashedly progressive message of taking on “the billionaire class” has drawn thousands of people — in some cases tens of thousands — to his rallies.

"Sanders, 74, will try to share his personal story with black voters this fall, including on a four-day southern swing starting Saturday: He grew up poor in a Brooklyn tenement, fought for civil rights as a college student and has advocated loudly for economic and social justice through three decades in elected office. He also hopes his calls for a $15-an-hour national minimum wage and free college tuition will resonate.","2104","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bernie-sanders-is-plotting-his-path-to-the-democratic-nomination/2015/09/11/08ddb472-573c-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html"

"Many Democratic leaders have doubts about Sanders’s viability. Of the roughly 700 superdelegates, who have a say in the nominating contest, more than 400 are supporting Clinton, her campaign says.

"“These campaigns run in phases, from the phase where people are expressing themselves passionately about issues to where they’re drilling down and asking tough questions about, ‘Okay, is this person equipped to be president of the United States?’ ” Axelrod said. “The tests become more exacting.”","2114","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bernie-sanders-is-plotting-his-path-to-the-democratic-nomination/2015/09/11/08ddb472-573c-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html"
"This summer, the enthusiasm Sanders stirred overwhelmed his minimalist campaign infrastructure. To catch up, officials are building what Weaver called a “cutting-edge distributive organizing program” for the more than 140,000 people who have signed up to volunteer. National field staffers are being hired to direct volunteer leaders in a state-by-state tiered network, who in turn will manage other volunteers in their regions.","2115","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bernie-sanders-is-plotting-his-path-to-the-democratic-nomination/2015/09/11/08ddb472-573c-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html"

"At Sanders rallies, volunteers armed with clipboards work the perimeters, gathering contact information from attendees. The campaign hits them up for contributions.

"“The Clinton people are trying to max people out,” Devine, noting the legal maximum donation of $2,700 per person. “Our approach to the fundraising is the exact opposite.

"Unlike Clinton, Sanders has not begun airing costly television advertisements.

"They decided not to. Instead, they husbanded most of their resources and made what Devine called an aggressive digital ad buy in the same markets — Manchester, Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and others.

"“People are not watching 5-and-a-half seconds of it; they’re watching 5-and-a-half minutes of it, from beginning to end — the whole thing,” Devine said. “If I pay a few cents for that while our opponent is paying several million dollars [for TV ads], we are gaining a significant tactical advantage.”","2121","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bernie-sanders-is-plotting-his-path-to-the-democratic-nomination/2015/09/11/08ddb472-573c-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html"

"SEN. BERNIE Sanders (I-Vt.) delivered a forceful message in a speech at Liberty University on Monday: Inequality is too high, the wealth gap is immoral and rich people have rigged the economy.","September 15","2212","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-as-progressive-as-you-think/2015/09/15/a0e8917c-5b26-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"
"Though hyperbolic, this message appears to be resonating: In a time of anxiety about the country’s economic future, the latest Post-ABC News poll shows Mr. Sanders cutting into Hillary Clinton’s once commanding lead for the Democratic presidential nomination.","2213","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-as-progressive-as-you-think/2015/09/15/a0e8917c-5b26-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"
"Beyond the hyperbole, however, must be real policy. And on that score, this self-described socialist from New England is less progressive — in the real effect of his proposals — than he sounds. His promises, according to a new analysis from the Wall Street Journal, would cost the government an eye-popping $18 trillion over 10 years. Instead of carefully crafting policy to help those who need it, he would shower largess on young and old, poor and well-to-do.","2214","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-as-progressive-as-you-think/2015/09/15/a0e8917c-5b26-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"
"For example: Mr. Sanders wants to make public college free for everyone. “We have in this country sufficient amounts of money to put more people in jail than any other country on earth,” Mr. Sanders said Monday. “But apparently we do not have enough money to provide jobs and education to our young people. I believe that’s wrong.”","2215","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-as-progressive-as-you-think/2015/09/15/a0e8917c-5b26-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"
"Mr. Sanders seems to be echoing President Obama, who pointed out this summer that the $80 billion the country spends on incarcerating people could pay for universal pre-kindergarten education, a doubling of salaries for high school teachers or the elimination of public college tuition.","2216","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-as-progressive-as-you-think/2015/09/15/a0e8917c-5b26-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"
"Of course, there’s only so much money that the government can realistically remove from the prison system. But say Mr. Sanders could take out $47 billion, the cost of the higher education bill he unveiled in May. Or say he found the money somewhere else — he proposed a financial transactions tax in the bill. Why would Mr. Sanders want to give any of those funds to the wealthy? Eliminating public college tuition makes it free for everyone, poor or rich, leaving less of that $47 billion to help low-income people who really struggle to pay for college, day care and other basic needs.","2217","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-as-progressive-as-you-think/2015/09/15/a0e8917c-5b26-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"
"Mr. Sanders makes a similar misstep on the student debt “crisis.” He would drastically reduce the rate on new student loans and refinance existing loans on similarly generous terms. Yet plenty of college graduates go on to high-paying careers and do not need help with their loans. Federal education loan policy is already generous, given that students often have little to no credit history. Instead of lowering everyone’s rates, additional aid should be targeted at those who have trouble paying. Mr. Obama has tried to do this by tying repayment and forgiveness policies to post-graduation income, but the system could be improved.","2218","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-as-progressive-as-you-think/2015/09/15/a0e8917c-5b26-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"
"Mr. Sanders identifies significant challenges, and we support higher taxes to meet some of them. But the political barriers even to modest new spending are formidable. A true progressive agenda would seek to dismantle those barriers, not create new entitlements for the upper middle class.","2219","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-as-progressive-as-you-think/2015/09/15/a0e8917c-5b26-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html"

"Holy cow! He must be advocating for some crazy stuff that will bankrupt America! But is that really an accurate picture of what Sanders is proposing? And is this the kind of number we should be frightened of?","2221","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"The answer isn’t quite so dramatic: while Sanders does want to spend significant amounts of money, almost all of it is on things we’re already paying for; he just wants to change how we pay for them. In some ways it’s by spreading out a cost currently borne by a limited number of people to all taxpayers. His plan for free public college would do this: right now, it’s paid for by students and their families, while under Sanders’ plan we’d all pay for it in the same way we all pay for parks or the military or food safety.","2222","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"But the bulk of what Sanders wants to do is in the first category: to have us pay through taxes for things we’re already paying for in other ways. Depending on your perspective on government, you may think that’s a bad idea. But we shouldn’t treat his proposals as though they’re going to cost us $18 trillion on top of what we’re already paying.","2223","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"And there’s another problem with that scary $18 trillion figure, which is what the Journal says is the 10-year cost of Sanders’ ideas: fully $15 trillion of it comes not from an analysis of anything Sanders has proposed, but from the fact that Sanders has said he’d like to see a single-payer health insurance system, and there’s a single-payer plan in Congress that has been estimated to cost $15 trillion. Sanders hasn’t actually released any health care plan, so we have no idea what his might cost.","2224","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"But health care is nevertheless a good place to examine why these big numbers can be so misleading. At the moment, total health care spending in the United States runs over $3 trillion a year; according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, over the next decade (from 2015-2024), America will spend a total of $42 trillion on health care. This is money that you and I and everyone else spends. We spend it in a variety of ways: through our health-insurance premiums, through the reduced salaries we get if our employers pick up part or all of the cost of those premiums, through our co-pays and deductibles, and through our taxes that fund Medicare, Medicaid, ACA subsidies, and the VA health care system. We’re already paying about $10,000 a year per capita for health care.","2225","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"So let’s say that Bernie Sanders became president and passed a single-payer health care system of some sort. And let’s say that it did indeed cost $15 trillion over 10 years. Would that be $15 trillion in new money we’d be spending? No, it would be money that we’re already spending on health care, but now it would go through government. If I told you I could cut your health insurance premiums by $1,000 and increase your taxes by $1,000, you wouldn’t have lost $1,000. You’d be in the same place you are now.","2226","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"By the logic of the scary $18 trillion number, you could take a candidate who has proposed nothing on health care, and say, “So-and-so proposes spending $42 trillion on health care!” It would be accurate, but not particularly informative.","2227","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"There’s something else to keep in mind: every single-payer system in the world, and there are many of them of varying flavors, is cheaper than the American health care system. Every single one. So whatever you might say about Sanders’ advocacy for a single-payer system, you can’t say it represents some kind of profligate, free-spending idea that would cost us all terrible amounts of money.","2228","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"Since Sanders hasn’t released a health care plan yet, we can’t make any assessment of the true cost of his plan, because there is no plan. Maybe what he wants to do would cost more than $15 trillion, or maybe it would cost less. But given the experience of the rest of the world, there’s a strong likelihood that over the long run, a single-payer plan would save America money. Again, you may think single-payer is a bad idea for any number of reasons, but “It’ll be too expensive!” is probably the least valid objection you could make.","2229","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"There are some proposals that involve spending new money that we never would have spent otherwise, like starting a war that ends up costing $2 trillion. But in every case, whether we’re doing something new or doing something we’re already doing but in a new way, the question isn’t what the price tag is, the question is whether we think what we’d get for that money makes spending it worthwhile.","2230","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"For instance, Sanders wants to spend $1 trillion over 10 years on infrastructure. That’s a lot of money, but it’s significantly less than experts say we need to repair all of our crumbling roads, bridges, water systems, and so on. And infrastructure spending creates immediate jobs and has economic benefits that persist over time, which we’d also have to take into account in deciding whether it’s a good idea. But just saying, “$1 trillion is a lot of money!” doesn’t tell you whether or not we should do it.","2231","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"The conservatives who are acting appalled at the number the Journal came up with are also the same people who never seem to care what a tax cut costs, because they think cutting taxes is a moral and practical good, in the same way that liberals think providing people with health coverage is a moral and practical good. For instance, Jeb Bush recently proposed a tax cut plan whose 10-year cost could be as high as $3.4 trillion. That’s a lot of money that the government wouldn’t be able to spend on the things it’s doing right now, although the campaign argues that we’d get much of that money back in increased revenues because of the spectacular growth the tax cuts would create. If you remember the claims that George W. Bush’s tax cuts would create stunning growth and prosperity for all, you might be just a bit skeptical of the Jeb campaign’s similar assertions. But in any case, we can’t evaluate the value of Jeb’s plan just by saying that $3.4 trillion is a big number. If you knew that the average family in the middle of the income distribution would get less than $1,000 from Jeb’s plan, while the average family in the top one percent would get a tax cut of over $80,000, then you’d have a better sense of whether it’s a good or bad idea.","2232","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"
"As a general matter, when you see a headline with an unimaginably large number, chances are it’s going to confuse you more than it will enlighten you. The question when it comes to government should always be not what we’re spending, but what we’re getting for what we spend.","2233","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/15/no-bernie-sanders-is-not-going-to-bankrupt-america-to-the-tune-of-18-trillion/"

"In 1981, when Sanders ran for mayor of Burlington as a far-left independent, he was tagged as a socialist by his enemies.

"By “regular,” I mean that we need to assume that Sanders is actually trying to become president. That may sound obvious, but it would be a change in how he’s been covered. While there are plenty of long shots in both parties’ primary races and candidates about whom we say that their best scenario may be getting a radio show out of the effort, Sanders may be the only one about whom so many reporters have assumed that even he isn’t actually trying to win.

"I have no idea if Sanders anticipated the success that he’s now having, but it’s undeniable and has to be reckoned with. It’s not just fundraising: according to the Huffpost Pollster average, he now trails Hillary Clinton by only 15 points, 42-27. Three months ago that margin was more like 40 points, and that 27-point average means he has more support among Democrats than any single GOP candidate has among Republicans.","2297","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/01/its-time-to-treat-bernie-sanders-like-a-real-presidential-candidate/"
"Sure, you might say, but everyone knows the guy isn’t going to be the Democratic nominee. Maybe he is, and maybe he isn’t. But so what? That should be a minor consideration at most. “Who’s the nominee going to be?” is not only a question the media is terrible at predicting the answer to, and it’s far from the most important question we might ask about the campaign.

"His policies: Sanders has plenty of policy ideas, and they provide an interesting contrast with those of his main opponent, Hillary Clinton, since he places himself to the left of her on many issues. Furthermore, they’re providing much of the fuel for his campaign — Democratic voters aren’t flocking to him because of his rugged good looks and mellifluous speaking voice. So we should be doing more stories looking deeply into the specific things he wants to do if he becomes president.","2300","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/01/its-time-to-treat-bernie-sanders-like-a-real-presidential-candidate/"
"Those stories haven’t been completely absent, but they haven’t been frequent enough. For instance, today the Post’s David Fahrenthold has a story examining Sanders’ ideas for expanding government benefits in areas like education and health care. The story is extremely skeptical of those ideas, but it takes them seriously and tries to grapple with what their effects might be (at least the negative effects; Fahrenthold doesn’t spend much time examining the potential benefits of what Sanders proposes). You might not like the story — I’m sure Sanders supporters would characterize it as contemptuous — but it discusses Sanders’ policy proposals without bothering with whether he can win the nomination. There should be more of that (and that applies to other candidates as well).","2301","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/01/its-time-to-treat-bernie-sanders-like-a-real-presidential-candidate/"

"Treating Sanders like a regular candidate would mean not just increasing the volume of coverage he receives, which is absolutely warranted, but also covering all these areas. I’ll admit that I’m as guilty as anyone — I haven’t been giving Sanders as much attention as I should have. But we’ve passed the point where the Sanders campaign is just a novelty. It doesn’t matter whether he’s going to be the nominee or not. He should be getting more (and more comprehensive) coverage than he has gotten up to this point.

"Money is, of course, a sign of broader trends in the race as well. Sanders is the grass-roots candidate who is appealing to the heart of the party base; Clinton is the lead candidate, accruing donations — at least in part — out of a sense that, in the end, she will be the nominee.

"Sanders’s campaign announced that it raised an eye-bugging $26 million in the third quarter — essentially matching the $28 million raised during those three months by Hillary Clinton, long considered the presumptive Democratic nominee.

"On paper, Sanders is wildly unlikely as a Democratic nominee. He’s hardly even a Democrat — he represents Vermont in the Senate as an Independent.

"Yet polls show Sanders leading Clinton in New Hampshire and essentially tied with her in Iowa. It is possible that Clinton could lose the first two primary states and still win the nomination, but only two Democrats have accomplished this feat — Bill Clinton, who didn’t even campaign in Iowa in 1992, and George McGovern, for whom the subsequent 1972 general election did not work out well.","2352","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-sanders-and-trump-have-in-common/2015/10/01/269acbd6-686b-11e5-9ef3-fde182507eac_story.html"
"Sanders’s money haul has to worry Clinton, not just for its size but for the way it was achieved. The vast majority came in small donations — Sanders’s average contribution is less than $25 .

"While the Clinton machine has made a point of being thrifty — requiring many staff members, for example, to take the bus between Washington and campaign headquarters in Brooklyn — it’s still, as Donald Trump might say, yooooge.

Among Democrats, the Sanders insurgency and the yearning for Vice President Biden to enter the race show that the party has not embraced Clinton as the inevitable nominee.

"In 1877, Rutherford B. Hayes became the first president to make a strong case for universally available public education. “Universal suffrage should rest upon universal education,” he said in his inaugural address, adding that “liberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools.” Hayes, a Republican, didn’t worry that some poor kid might benefit from access to “free stuff,” nor did he believe that the children of wealthy elites should be excluded from the universal nature of the program. For him, education was the basis for full economic and political participation, and full participation was the basis for all prosperity. An education should be available to all regardless of anyone’s station.","October 22","2451","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-america-needs-free-college-now/2015/10/22/a3d05512-7685-11e5-bc80-9091021aeb69_story.html"
"Today, there is universal access to free, public schools across the United States for kindergarten through 12th grade. That didn’t happen by presidential decree. It took populist pressure from the progressive movement, beginning in the 1890s, to make widespread access to free public schools a reality. By 1940, half of all young people were graduating from high school. As of 2013, that number was 81 percent. But that achievement is no longer enough. A college degree is the new high school diploma.","2452","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-america-needs-free-college-now/2015/10/22/a3d05512-7685-11e5-bc80-9091021aeb69_story.html"

"In the 1950s and 1960s, it was possible to graduate from high school and move right into a decent-paying job with good benefits. Strong unions offered apprenticeships, and a large manufacturing sector provided opportunities for those without an advanced degree. A couple with a sole breadwinner could buy a home, raise a family and send their kids to college. That was the American dream. Unfortunately, today, for too many Americans, it’s not a possibility.","2454","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-america-needs-free-college-now/2015/10/22/a3d05512-7685-11e5-bc80-9091021aeb69_story.html"
"An important pathway to the middle class now runs through higher education, but rising costs are making it harder and harder for ordinary Americans to get the education they want and need. In 1978, it was possible to earn enough money to pay for a year of college tuition just by working a summer job that paid minimum wage. Today, it would take a minimum wage worker an entire year to earn enough to cover the annual in-state tuition at a public university. And that’s why so many bright young people don’t go to college, don’t finish or graduate deeply in debt. With $1.3 trillion in student loans, Americans are carrying more student debt than credit card or auto-loan debt. That’s a tragedy for our young people and for our nation.","2455","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-america-needs-free-college-now/2015/10/22/a3d05512-7685-11e5-bc80-9091021aeb69_story.html"
"In my view, education is essential for personal and national well-being. We live in a highly competitive, global economy, and if our economy is to be strong, we need the best-educated workforce in the world. We won’t achieve that if, every year, hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go to college while millions more leave school deeply in debt.

"It may seem hard to believe, but there was a time when higher education was pretty close to free in this country, at least for many Americans. After World War II, the GI Bill gave free education to more than 2 million veterans, many of whom would otherwise never have been able to go to college. This benefited them, and it was good for the economy and the country, too. In fact, scholars say that this investment was a major reason for the high productivity and economic growth our nation enjoyed during the postwar years. And, in certain states, such as California and New York, tuition was so low that college was practically free for much of the 20th century. That is no longer the case in America, but free college is still a priority in many parts of the world.","2458","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-america-needs-free-college-now/2015/10/22/a3d05512-7685-11e5-bc80-9091021aeb69_story.html"
"In Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Mexico, public colleges and universities remain tuition-free. They’re free throughout Germany, too, and not just for Germans or Europeans but for international citizens as well. That’s why every year, more than 4,600 students leave the United States and enroll in German universities. For a token fee of about $200 per year, an American can earn a degree in math or engineering from one of the premier universities in Europe. Governments in these countries understand what an important investment they are making, not just in the individuals who are able to acquire knowledge and skills but for the societies these students will serve as teachers, architects, scientists, entrepreneurs and more.","2459","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-america-needs-free-college-now/2015/10/22/a3d05512-7685-11e5-bc80-9091021aeb69_story.html"

"Socialists believe that the government should provide a wide range of basic services to its citizens free of charge or at a discount, typically including university education and health care, as well as child care, housing, telecommunications, energy and more in some countries. They believe that these services should be available to everyone, not just the neediest.

"Socialists think that public or worker ownership can provide these services more cheaply and more equitably than the free market. They also hope to use these sectors of the economy to establish genuine equality of opportunity — in other words, they think that everyone should have a truly equal chance at success in life, regardless of the advantages of birth.

In particular, Sanders favors universal government services that are available to everyone regardless of how much they make. Clinton wants to limit those benefits to the people who really need them.","2509","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"So, for example, Sanders has proposed offering most Social Security recipients more generous benefits. At the debate, Clinton also said she thought that Social Security checks should be more generous, but only for retirees who are the most in need.","2510","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"Likewise, Clinton opposes Sanders's proposal to pay for college tuition through the government. She has noted that many people who go to college come from affluent families. She cited the children of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in particular. In her view, the government has no business paying for rich kids like them to go to school.","2511","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"The big one — and the one that Clinton alluded to — is that reforms such as those proposed by Sanders would be costly. Limiting college tuition and other benefits to the people who need them most would be less expensive. In order to fund government services, many northern European countries impose higher taxes on their citizens. Clinton discussed making sure that wealthy Americans pay their fair share in taxes at the debate, but she also said she wanted to reduce taxes for the middle class. It probably isn't possible to pay for the kinds of reforms that Sanders is advocating while reducing taxes for ordinary Americans.","2512","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"As this chart shows, average workers in places like France and Finland pay more than 40 percent of their income as taxes, compared to closer to 30 percent in the United States.","2513","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"","2514","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"Sanders and his supporters could respond that Americans already pay monthly bills for college tuition and health insurance, and it might not make much difference to them whether they paid for those things on Tax Day instead. For example, some economists have argued that a national, single-payer health care system such as the one Sanders is advocating would actually save money on balance.","2515","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"On the other hand, many economists believe that higher tax rates can be detrimental to economic growth. They think that taxes discourage people from working and from putting their utmost into the economy, because they don't benefit as much from their hard work as they would if they didn't pay tax.","2516","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"Maybe.","2517","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"As Matt Bruenig of Demos notes, socialist countries such as those in the Nordic region are far outpacing the United States in terms of productivity. In other words, the amount that each worker in those countries produces in a given amount of time has improved more in those countries than it has here, as this chart shows.","2518","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"These figures suggest that contrary to economists' predictions, people aren't putting any less effort into the economy there than they are here, despite those socialist policies. There's only one way to find out, of course — but Sanders has a difficult primary campaign ahead of him if he hopes to defeat Clinton for the Democratic nomination.","2519","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/"
"Bernie Sanders has been hinting for months now that he'll have more to say on marijuana in the 2016 election. Tonight, it looks like he'll finally say it.","October 28","2520","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"
"Sanders will call for marijuana to be removed from the Drug Enforcement Administration's schedule of controlled substances. Doing so would be a big deal for marijuana policy in this country. While it wouldn't legalize marijuana at the federal level per se, it would allow states to pursue their own marijuana policies free of most federal interference. The DEA classifies marijuana as a schedule 1 drug because it says that the drug has no medically accepted use and high potential for abuse. It's regulated more tightly than other drugs that are far more deadly and less medically useful, like cocaine, opium and methamphetamines.","2521","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"
"""The time is long overdue for us to take marijuana off the federal government’s list of outlawed drugs,"" he said in prepared remarks given to the Post by his campaign.

"1. The DEA would stop raiding marijuana businesses and customers.","2524","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"
"Already, they're not supposed to be doing this when it comes to medical marijuana providers. Measures attached to last year's ""cromnibus"" spending bill were meant to prevent the Department of Justice from pursuing legal actions against medical marijuana businesses in compliance with applicable state laws. But the department has effectively ignored those guidelines this year, prompting a stern rebuke from a federal judge earlier this month.","2525","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"
"Recreational marijuana businesses don't have the congressional protections afforded to medical providers. The Department of Justice has advised federal prosecutors to use discretion when pursuing marijuana cases, and to focus primarily on cases where marijuana is being distributed to minors, trafficked to states where it isn't legal, or other instances in clear violation of the law.","2526","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"
"But this memo isn't legally binding. Essentially, federal authorities have offered a handshake agreement that they won't bother marijuana businesses in compliance with state laws. But under a new president or a new attorney general, that could change. Removing marijuana from the schedule of controlled substances would eliminate this grey area entirely.","2527","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"

"Since pot is illegal at the federal level, most banks -- even ones in states where marijuana is legal -- are wary about doing business with marijuana customers. Colorado set up a credit union for marijuana businesses last year in order to address this concern, but the Federal Reserve recently blocked the move by saying it wouldn't accept any money from marijuana businesses. This would prevent the credit union from accessing the electronic networks that would allow it to do commerce with other parts of the national banking system.","2529","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"
"This move appears to contradict guidance given out by the Treasury Department last year that tried to ""enhance the availability of financial services for, and the financial transparency of, marijuana-related businesses."" Instances like this, where different parts of the federal government issue contradictory rulings on the same issue, are one of the reasons why running a marijuana businesses can be so costly -- and so risky -- even in places where state law allows it.","2530","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"

"An obscure provision in the federal tax code prevents businesses ""trafficking"" in controlled substances from taking advantage of tax breaks and exemptions available to other businesses. In legal marijuana states, it essentially puts the marijuana industry in a Catch-22: marijuana businesses have to file federal tax returns, but they can't deduct the types of expenses that businesses usually deduct. In some cases, marijuana businesses are paying effective tax rates of 80 or 90 percent.","2533","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"

"Currently, marijuana researchers face a tangle of red tape when it comes to conducting studies on the medical uses of the plant. This has prompted everyone from the Brookings Institution to the American Medical Association to call on the government to make it easier to work with the drug. But the Drug Enforcement Administration has rejected numerous attempts to relax marijuana rules over the decades, sometimes overriding the recommendations of federal judges.","2535","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"

"For decades, the Drug Enforcement Administration has been pursuing a marijuana eradication program ""to halt the spread of cannabis cultivation in the United States."" The program is costly -- it costs $60 to pull up a single pot plant in Oregon, where marijuana is legal -- and it's pulling up less weed as more growers shift to indoor grow methods.","2538","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"
"It has also proven to be incredibly ineffective. In 1977, two years before the program started, 24 percent of Americans said they had ever tried marijuana, according to Gallup. By 2015, that number was up to 44 percent.","2539","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"

"Marijuana was originally placed on Schedule 1 as a temporary measure in 1970 while a government-convened panel of experts figured out how to handle it from a legal standpoint. Two years later, the panel recommended complete decriminalization of small amounts of the drug: ""the Commission recommends ... [that the] possession of marijuana for personal use no longer be an offense, [and that the] casual distribution of small amounts of marijuana for no remuneration, or insignificant remuneration, no longer be an offense.""","2541","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"
"But President Richard Nixon ignored his own commission's findings and kept marijuana on Schedule 1, saying ""we need, and I use the word 'all out war,' on all fronts"" when it came to weed.","2542","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"

"Even Republican voters, who are generally more skeptical of marijuana legalization, say that states should be able to carry out their own marijuana laws without federal interference. The National Conference of State Legislatures has said the same thing. Removing marijuana from the schedule of controlled substances would simply add a federal imprimatur to a way of thinking held by a majority of Americans.","2544","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/28/why-bernie-sanders-marijuana-proposal-would-be-a-big-deal/"

"In appealing to the principles of freedom and ""economic rights,"" in a phrase of Roosevelt's that Sanders quoted, the senator from Vermont tried to steal the thunder from his conservative detractors. His opponents also cite personal freedom, saying Sanders's vision of socialism would leave Americans less free to pursue their economic interests without interference from government. Under his agenda, for example, private health insurers and colleges would have to compete with government-sponsored insurance and education, and the rich would have to forfeit more of their earnings in taxes.","2549","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-is-right-the-top-0-1-have-as-much-as-the-bottom-90/"

"In 2014, just 160,000 families, each with a net worth in excess of $20.6 million, counted themselves among the wealthiest 0.1 percent of households.

"""The name Dorothy Day has not been used in the United States Congress terribly often,"" said Sanders in a short interview. ""She was a valiant fighter for workers, was very strong in her belief for social justice, and I think it was extraordinary that he cited her as one of the most important people in recent American history. This would be one of the very, very few times that somebody as radical as Dorothy Day was mentioned.""","2604","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/24/the-pope-name-dropped-a-radical-catholic-activist-and-bernie-sanders-couldnt-be-happier/"
"Day was arguably the least famous of the four Americans Francis cited in the speech, but she was a vital and controversial figure on the American left. Like Martin Luther King -- also cited by Francis -- she had a thick FBI file, compiled by agents tracking her support for democratic socialism and opposition to foreign wars. ""We need to change the system,"" Day wrote in 1956. ""We need to overthrow, not the government, as the authorities are always accusing the Communists 'of conspiring to teach [us] to do,' but this rotten, decadent, putrid industrial capitalist system which breeds such suffering in the whited sepulcher of New York.""","2605","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/24/the-pope-name-dropped-a-radical-catholic-activist-and-bernie-sanders-couldnt-be-happier/"

"Recent support for Day's possible canonization has angered some conservatives. ""Vatican archives are filled with reports of Christians martyred under the regimes that Dorothy Day supported,"" wrote Virginia State Senator Dick Black in a 2013 letter to Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict.

"Sanders, well aware of Day's views and her critics, considered it bold and telling that Francis would praise her. ""He is willing to identify with an extraordinarily courageous woman whose life was about standing with the poorest people in America, and having the courage to stand up to the very powerful,"" he said. ""You know, her newspaper was the Catholic Worker, and she stood with the workers of America and fought for justice.""","2608","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/24/the-pope-name-dropped-a-radical-catholic-activist-and-bernie-sanders-couldnt-be-happier/"
"The Vermont senator was less concerned by Francis's glancing mentions of other issues that animate progressives, such as climate change and gay rights. ""He knew where he was speaking,"" said Sanders. ""I think he does not want to be rude, as a guest.

"SANDERS: Anderson, thank you very much. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises.

"SANDERS: Let's begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA. Let's also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons. And over the years, I have strongly supported instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole. And I think we've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers.

The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world.","2865","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-oct-13-democratic-debate-who-said-what-and-what-it-means/"

We had a murderous dictator, Gadhafi, who had American blood on his hands, as I'm sure you remember, threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people.

"Bernie Sanders has been asked many times (mostly by reporters, not voters) about whether the fact that he calls himself a “democratic socialist” makes him unelectable. But the truth is that the question hasn’t been nearly as problematic for Sanders as one might have expected.

"And in the process, Sanders could well bring socialism, or at least the variant he calls “democratic socialism,” into the mainstream.","3439","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"
"Yesterday Sanders gave a speech in which he outlined his vision of democratic socialism, which is essentially what in Europe they call “social democracy.” It covered both means and ends, but was actually light on philosophical underpinnings, except by implication. He said that health care should be a right, not a privilege (with a universal single-payer system); that everyone who wants to should be able to go to college; that we should invest in infrastructure; that no one who works full time should live in poverty (so raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour); and that loopholes that allow corporations to shield themselves from taxation should be closed. In other words, what he advocates is not some alien and threatening set of ideas, it’s basically contemporary Democratic ideology, albeit on the liberal end. Here’s how he closed the section of the speech explaining what his socialism consists of:","3440","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"
"That’s not exactly a list of radical notions.","3441","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"
"Sanders is advocating an American version of European social democracy, which sought to incorporate socialist principles of equality and collective responsibility within the capitalist, democratic system. Its manifestation there in places like Denmark (Sanders’ favorite example) is a system with plenty of economic freedom, but a more robust welfare state than the one we have, offering people benefits like free child care, paid family leave, universal health care, and free university education.","3442","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"
"Among the major differences between European and American politics is that in most European countries, even the conservatives accept the broad contours of the social democratic welfare state, while American conservatives don’t. Our conservatives have long believed that expansions of the welfare state have a zero-sum relationship to liberty itself. That’s why Ronald Reagan said in the 1960s that if Medicare passed, “behind it will come other government programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day as Norman Thomas said we will wake to find that we have socialism,” which would mean “we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it once was like in America when men were free.” Even if today’s conservatives grudgingly accept the existence of Medicare in their rhetoric (though they’re always trying to dismantle, cut, or privatize it), they still believe in this zero-sum relationship.","3443","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"
"The argument from social democrats is that having something like Medicare doesn’t make us less free; quite the contrary, it provides us the security that allows us to freely pursue our own happiness. But conservatives still argue that any expansion of the welfare state is little more than the first step on the road to a communist totalitarian nightmare, where we’ll spend all our time standing in breadlines in our itchy and depressing grey sackcloth coats.","3444","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"
"Sanders’ campaign may serve to make that caricature less persuasive, which is already happening anyway. For decades, democratic socialists had to fend off the charge that they were really communists in disguise, but the passage of time and history has begun to free them from that charge. As Harold Meyerson notes: “The anti-socialist and anti-liberal leaders who deliberately conflated Rooseveltian liberalism with Stalinist communism (the young Richard Nixon was a master at this) were put out of work with the fall of the Berlin Wall.” Two and a half decades later, the only person who bothers to call Sanders a communist is Donald Trump, and it sounds so weird that no one else agrees.","3445","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"
"In fact, polls in recent years have found that socialism’s image in America isn’t so terrible. This YouGov poll, for instance, found that Democrats and people under 30 (for whom the Cold War is ancient history) felt equally favorable toward socialism and capitalism; other polls have produced similar results. For many, then, there isn’t necessarily a contradiction between the two.","3446","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"
"Even though he likes to talk about “a political revolution,” Sanders is actually arguing that the systems in those European countries differ from our own only in degree. We have Medicare for people over 65; they have the equivalent of Medicare for everybody, which is what Sanders wants. By invoking FDR and MLK, and pointing to the parts of the American system that embody his democratic socialist principles, he’s saying that those elements are already within our system, so they aren’t anything to be afraid of.","3447","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"
"The more Sanders has a chance to make this case to a broad audience of Americans, the more “democratic socialism” sounds like little more than what a liberal Democrat these days believes. And if that idea takes hold and spreads, his campaign will have had a truly profound impact.","3448","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/how-bernie-sanders-is-mainstreaming-democratic-socialism/"

"A series of Gallup polls this summer found that Sanders has a +13 favorability rating among African Americans, compared with Hillary Clinton’s +68 favorability rating. There are many reasons for Sanders’s poor polling with African American voters: his unknown name, the limited diversity of his home state, his shaky response to interactions with Black Lives Matter protesters.

"Political consultant L. Joy Williams says Sanders could have won the allegiance of some black voters by responding to his supporters’ combative and patronizing comments and distancing himself from them. It would have been a good opportunity for the candidate to interact with black press and connect with black Americans, she said. “It’s not as if he went on NewsOne Now or did an interview with black press and said, ‘I am dismayed by the way some of those who support me are treating us [black voters].’ That never happened.”","3463","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/23/on-twitter-bernie-sanderss-supporters-are-becoming-one-of-his-biggest-problems/"

"The go-to defense for Sanders’s supporters is to mention the candidate’s involvement in civil rights protests in the 1960s. The implication is that black Americans owe their votes to Sanders today because he did the right thing by supporting black Americans’ rights 60 years ago.

"Marching with King is not a coronation to the black vote, nor was his endorsement of Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign. Many people reasonably question whether Sanders’s message of fixing economic inequality will benefit African Americans. The revolting tone of the backlash to critiques of Sanders’s record on racial issues is the digital manifestation of a historical divide between black Americans and white progressives. From the labor movement of the post-industrial era to the feminist movement of the 1960s, people of color long have been sidelined and patronized when they try to exercise their voices in progressives spaces that claim to welcome them.","3468","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/23/on-twitter-bernie-sanderss-supporters-are-becoming-one-of-his-biggest-problems/"
"More recently, this lingering racial divide appeared in New York City’s Occupy Wall Street Movement, which I covered for TheGrio in 2011. Each evening in Zuccotti Park, young men and women took to the mic, lamenting the greed and excess of the 1 percent at the expense of the 99 percent. Though the movement was leaderless, the voices most often heard were those of white men and women. Dozens of nonwhite organizers grew so tired of being shut out of strategy meetings that they formed a “People of Color Working Group” to assert their presence and express their grievances of economic racism.","3469","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/23/on-twitter-bernie-sanderss-supporters-are-becoming-one-of-his-biggest-problems/"
"Occupy focused on class struggle, while economic racism — the systemic ways in which racism limits economic opportunity for people of color — was barely acknowledged or outright ignored. Across the country, people of color were present in Occupy, but a study of the movement’s racial representation found that African Americans made up just 1.6 percent of its participants.","3470","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/23/on-twitter-bernie-sanderss-supporters-are-becoming-one-of-his-biggest-problems/"
"Sanders’s message, like that of Occupy, generally deals with economic inequality. While he has spoken about how economic inequality affects communities of color, that’s not the same as articulating the words “economic racism” and addressing the friction between black and white progressives.","3471","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/23/on-twitter-bernie-sanderss-supporters-are-becoming-one-of-his-biggest-problems/"
"It’s true that Sanders understands the economic ills of America like few others in Congress. But he’s done little recently to show that he understands the particular ways those ills affect black Americans. It’s unclear how they should see themselves in an America run by President Bernie Sanders.","3472","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/23/on-twitter-bernie-sanderss-supporters-are-becoming-one-of-his-biggest-problems/"

"Sanders’s team seems savvy with social media — he effectively live-tweeted the GOP debate with a nimble combination of snark and intellectual depth. So it’s puzzling why his campaign has yet to use the platform to tweet about the racial animosity many black people feel emanating from his progressive base. Instead, Sanders has allowed these online rifts between his supporters and black users go unchecked. Or, for that matter, unacknowledged.","3474","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/23/on-twitter-bernie-sanderss-supporters-are-becoming-one-of-his-biggest-problems/"
"Will having a Twitter chat about racism in the progressive movement improve Sanders’s polling numbers? Likely not. The campaign’s challenges of earning black support are more expansive than social media. But there would be one less conflict for Sanders to navigate if black voters could see he doesn’t approve of the behavior of some white progressives who support him.","3475","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/23/on-twitter-bernie-sanderss-supporters-are-becoming-one-of-his-biggest-problems/"
"If he wants to see an exponential increase in black support, Sanders will have to prove to black voters that the world he envisions will be as beneficial to them as it will be for the mostly white progressives who support him. And that means he’ll have to unpack the lingering racism of the progressive movement.","3476","https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/23/on-twitter-bernie-sanderss-supporters-are-becoming-one-of-his-biggest-problems/"

"“If we are going to see an increase in drought, flood and extreme weather disturbances as a result of climate change, what that means is that people all over the world are going to be fighting over limited natural resources,” Sanders said. “If there is not enough water, if there is not enough land to grow your crops, then you’re going to see migrations of people fighting over land that will sustain them, and that will lead to international conflicts.”","3485","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/15/bernie-sanders-explains-connection-between-climate-change-and-paris-attacks/"

"“When you have drought, when people can’t grow their crops, they’re going to migrate into cities, and when people migrate into cities and they don’t have jobs, there’s going to be a lot more instability, a lot more unemployment and people will be subject to the types of propaganda that al-Qaeda and ISIS are using right now,” Sanders said, using an alternative name for the Islamic State. “So where you have discontent, where you have instability, that’s where problems arise, and certainly, without a doubt, climate change will lead to that.”","3487","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/15/bernie-sanders-explains-connection-between-climate-change-and-paris-attacks/"

"There may be no more important event on the calendar for Sanders than Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses. He is counting on a political revolution to sweep him into the White House.

"Nothing could be further from the truth. First of all, it was Bill Clinton and not Hillary Clinton that signed DOMA.

As senator from New York, she pushed to repeal the ban on gays in the military and secure employment protections for LGBT Americans. As secretary of state she extended her view of human and women’s rights with a groundbreaking speech at the United Nations in 2011 declaring that “gay rights are human rights” and made the protection of gays, lesbians and transgender people a priority in her dealings with repressive regimes around the world. Perhaps most importantly, she engaged with the community – closely – for the last 25 years.

Customers could walk down the street to the post office with their money and deposit it in a savings account there.","October 29","3682","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"
"The system made sense back in those days, when the country was more sparsely populated and banks were harder to find, but post offices were everywhere. Over the past 50 years, though, the total number of bank branches in the United States increased from 16,000 to 83,000. What's more, people visit the bank less frequently these days, given the ubiquity of credit cards and direct deposit.","3683","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"
"Still, there are still relatively few banks in many impoverished urban and rural neighborhoods, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, has a big idea for turning post offices back into banks. That's because he sees them as a place where the 68 million low-income Americans who currently rely on payday lenders and costly cash checking services could manage their affairs less expensively. (And banking might help the beleaguered Postal Service's bottom line as well.)","3684","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"
"""What people are forced to do is go to payday lenders who charge outrageously high interest rates. You go to check-cashing places, which rip you off,"" Sanders said recently.

"Postal banking is still a part of everyday life in many foreign countries, including the United Kingdom and France, and the U.S. postal inspector general issued a report endorsing the idea last year. The report argued the Postal Service should consider not only opening savings accounts again, but also expanding into short-term loans and debit cards as well.","3686","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"

"Maintaining a large volume of customers at each storefront is crucial for payday lending, according to a study of the industry published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. With more customers, lenders are able to defray the costs of keeping the lights on through lower interest rates. The most profitable payday lending branches have been open for a while and have established a base of customers in the neighborhood. The study found that on average, payday lending firms earn about nine cents on every dollar they loan.","3688","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"

"Perhaps above all, the Postal Service is an agency of the federal government. If borrowers failed to repay loans, the Treasury Department could seize their tax refunds at the end of the year, allowing post offices to limit their losses and offer more favorable interest rates than payday lenders.","3691","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"

"People have neighborly feelings about their local post office, and proponents argue that postal banking could protect the public from loan sharks. Yet as the inspector general's report makes clear, going to the Postal Service wouldn't exactly be like borrowing $20 from your grandma. In a hypothetical example considered in that report, the Postal Service offers loans at no less than 25 percent interest and seizes borrowers' money come April 15 if they don't pay up.","3693","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"
"The inspector general argues that 25 percent interest is still far cheaper than the fees charged by payday lenders, typically equivalent to 400 percent at an annual rate or even more. It's hard to know whether Treasury's strong arm, combined with the Postal Service's existing infrastructure, could reduce costs enough to offer customers even that rate.","3694","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"

"In any case, if the Postal Service were to underwrite loans, it wouldn't really be competing with payday lenders at all. Underwriting takes time. Many people patronize payday establishments because they need cash immediately, said Eva Wolkowitz, an associate at the Center for Financial Services Innovation, which studies financial products.","3700","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"
"Instead, the postal loans (at least as described by the inspector general) would be more akin to installment loans -- another, more obscure type of short-term loan. Unlike a payday loan, installment loans are paid back in several increments, rather than in a lump sum. While there is a wide range of interest rates on installment loans, they generally cost less than payday loans.","3701","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"
"Pawnshops and more Besides installment and payday loans, there are all kinds of alternative credit available, which is another limitation of postal banking.

"Wolkowitz and her colleagues have estimated that Americans spent $103 billion on alternative financial services in 2013. Yet only about $15 billion of that amount was spent on the forms of credit comparable to the proposed postal loans. You can see the distribution of these loans in the chart below.","3703","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"

"The Postal Service could take advantage of existing networks established by other post offices abroad to help immigrants wire money cheaply to relatives at home. The agency could offer savings accounts, as it did in the past, along with basic debit cards to help customers manage their money safely and cheaply.","3707","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/29/bernie-sanders-has-a-pretty-revolutionary-idea-to-change-americas-post-offices/"
"There would be competition, though. The basic debit cards known in the industry as reloadable prepaid cards are quickly becoming popular.

"A public institution The debate about postal banking raises big questions.

"As they see it, Sanders is arguing that the structure of the economy is the ultimate reason that America seems to be holding back its black citizens. It's too difficult for people in the working class to find a job and too expensive to get an education.

"From the point of view of the protesters, though, this explanation has things backward. Since before the country's founding, they argue, the American economic elite has used race to divide workers against one another, preventing them from banding together and putting people such as Sanders in power who would alter the balance in the economy in favor of the working class.

"How does Sanders solve that problem? It's not clear that he can -- at least in the near term. The best way to convince people that you can win is to, well, actually win something; New Hampshire looks like Sanders's best chance to do that but that's not until February.

But the policy implications of removing pot entirely from the government's schedule of controlled substances would be big: States would be allowed to legalize it without interference from Washington, it would help economies involving pot (like banking) grow without fear of prosecution from the federal government, and fewer people would go to jail for possessing marijuana.","4073","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/29/why-bernie-sanderss-marijuana-announcement-is-a-big-political-moment-for-pot/"

"There are a few reasons his announcement was a big moment for pot politically. First, the medical community at large would agree with Sanders that pot is not as dangerous as, say, crack cocaine and heroin and the other highly addictive drugs it is currently classified with. Respected organizations like the American Medical Association have also said keeping marijuana on a legally unreachable shelf stymies research for its healing potentials.

He regularly draws crowds in the thousands, if not tens of thousands, and is giving Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton a run for her money.

"Third, this just feels like something of a turning point in our nation's approach to marijuana.

He and and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley (D) have said they'd support bumping down a notch the government's classification of pot as a drug.

"Sanders has big plans for investments if he is elected president, with an agenda that includes $3.5 trillion over 10 years in proposed new spending programs — and an agenda could end up costing perhaps as much as $18.5 trillion more over the next 10 years. So his $1 trillion infrastructure proposal — spent over five years — is just a relatively small piece of that.","4092","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"To justify his statement that some large corporations are “not paying a nickel in federal taxes,” the Sanders campaign pointed to a study by Citizens for Tax Justice, specifically noting 12 companies that the left-leaning group said had paid effective tax rates of less than zero over a five year period while maintaining subsidiaries in tax havens.","4093","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"We are not going to dispute CTJ’s estimates, but it’s worth noting that nine of these companies did pay federal taxes in at least one year. Sanders’s justifies his “not one nickel” comment by adding up the tax bill over five years. So General Electric, for instance, paid federal taxes in 2011, 2012 and 2013—but Sanders claims negative taxes because the tax losses in 2010 and 2009 (in the aftermath of the financial crisis) exceeded the taxes paid in later years.","4094","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"Imagine if you got tax refunds in 2009 and 2010 that exceeded the taxes you paid in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Would you say you paid “not one nickel” in federal taxes? Didn’t think so. (Note: this example is not directly comparable because the tax losses allow companies to get refunds of taxes they owed and paid in the past.)","4095","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"At least Sanders specified “federal taxes.” As we have noted before, these companies pay all sorts of other taxes, such as sales taxes, property taxes, employment taxes and so forth.","4096","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"(Note: After we had quizzed Sanders’s staff about this language and written this fact check, but before we published it, Sanders framed it this way in the second Democratic debate on Nov. 14: “I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they’re stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.” That’s a more accurate way of putting it.)","4097","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"Moreover, Sanders is highlighting an important issue that has spawned bipartisan concern — the growing practice of U.S. multinational corporations avoiding or reducing U.S. taxes by keeping profits overseas in low-tax havens. One recent study, by Reed College economics professor Kimberly Clausing, estimates that the growing practice has led to revenue losses of between $77 billion and $111 billion by 2012. So we are not talking about an insubstantial amount of money.","4098","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"A recent letter signed by 24 international tax experts, led by Edward Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, noted that corporate “profits as a share of GDP [gross domestic product] — at 9.8 percent — are nearly at all-time highs. Their U.S. taxes as a share of GDP are just 2 percent, which are near all-time lows.”","4099","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"Would tapping these overseas profits be enough to fund a $1 trillion infrastructure plan? The Sanders campaign cited a Joint Committee on Taxation estimate for Sanders’s Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act, which would raise more than $113 billion over the next decade, as well as an $900 billion estimate in the tax lawyer’s letter for the cost of the “tax expenditure” that allows U.S. corporations to defer paying U.S. tax on their foreign earnings until that income is repatriated.","4100","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"“Sen. Sanders would use all of this revenue to pay for his $1 trillion Rebuild America Act,” policy director Warren Gunnels said. “It is common to pay for these types of investments over a 10-year period.”","4101","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"As we have written before, policymakers cannot assume that estimates for tax expenditures will result in the same level of revenue if such tax loopholes are eliminated. So a $900 billion tax expenditure does not automatically translate into $900 billion in revenue. But Kleinbard thinks that the number is not out of line, given that between $200 billion and $600 billion could be raised imposing a one-time mandatory clean-up tax on all low-taxed foreign earnings existing at the time of the conversion to a new tax system.","4102","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"A lot depends on how the law is crafted but “you might well conclude that it would be perfectly plausible to imagine picking up $500 to $600 billion in actual revenue in the first 5 years alone, so easily over $1 trillion over 10 — not counting the backward looking tax on existing earnings,” Kleinbard said. But he warned that no one knows how other countries (especially in the European Union) might react, which could allow them to get more of the untapped revenue. “A lot more revenue might be collected in general, but now the question shifts to, how much goes to Freedonia, and how much to the U.S.?”","4103","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"Still, we’re getting rather theoretical here. What matters most is that Sanders’s claim of raising $1 trillion is at least credible — assuming the money is not also earmarked for other spending projects.","4104","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"Finally, he says this spending will create as many as 13 million jobs. This is derived from a White House Council of Economic Advisers estimate that every $1 billion in federal highway and transit investment would support 13,000 jobs for one year. We have examined this estimate before, and it’s worth remembering that one-third of these jobs are directly created (such as construction workers), one-third are indirectly created (such as people hired by suppliers to construction firms) and one-third are induced (jobs created as the spending by employed construction workers filters through the economy).","4105","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"
"Some readers might object to counting indirect and induced jobs as part of the calculation, but this “multiplier effect” is fairly standard in terms of assessing economic impact. And, actually, 13,000 jobs per $1 billion is on the low side for these kind of estimates. Other estimates on the economic impact of government spending suggest 25,000 jobs per $1 billion, 29,000 jobs per $1 billion, 36,000 jobs per $1 billion and even 44,000 jobs per $1 billion — which certainly shows how uncertain the craft of economics can be.","4106","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/16/bernie-sanderss-claims-about-his-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan/"

"Trump’s rationale for avoiding Kelly’s debate question – that neither he nor America has time for “political correctness” – taps into a popular boogeyman. The term “political correctness” is so general that to most people it simply means a discomfort with changing times and attitudes, an attack on the traditions of how we were raised. (It’s an emotional challenge every generation has had to go through.) What it really means is nothing more than sensitizing people to the fact that some old-fashioned words, attitudes and actions may be harmful or insulting to others. Naturally, people are angry about that because it makes them feel stupid or mean when they really aren’t.

Instead of bullying their voices into silence or ridiculing them as losers, pigs or bimbos, Sanders left. After all, it was not his event; he was a guest.

He called the measure “not significant.” According to a June 1991 Reuters article, he said: “I can give you 50 issues that are more important than the Brady issue,” he said, citing education, job opportunities and drug rehabilitation. “What we are trying to do in Vermont is build a movement of workers, farmers, women and poor people.”","4169","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-the-brady-bill-and-instant-background-checks/"
"Critics said Sanders caved into the demands of the NRA, which supported him in his 1990 election.

"When pressed in 2013 about his gun policy votes, including on the assault weapons ban, Sanders offered little explanation beyond his standard response: “This is not one of my major issues. It’s an issue out there. I’ve told you how I feel about it. If there’s anything else you want to ask me about, I’m happy to answer. But that’s about it.” He said even if Congress “passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don’t think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen.”","4172","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-the-brady-bill-and-instant-background-checks/"
"Eric Davis, Middlebury College professor emeritus of political science who has followed Sanders’s political career, said: “Guns are not an issue that’s really ever been something that he’s placed emphasis on. … I think he’s realizing this now, and he’s growing in this as he deals with voters that are more diverse, in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. He’s hearing more about African Americans, Latinos and other diverse voters … in a way that he didn’t have to in Vermont because those voters didn’t make up much of his constituency.”","4173","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-the-brady-bill-and-instant-background-checks/"
"Other votes","4174","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-the-brady-bill-and-instant-background-checks/"
"Sanders did vote to ban assault weapons. He voted to close the so-called “gun show loophole” (a term referring to person-to-person sales through unlicensed sellers) in 1999 and supported the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2013, which would have required background checks for firearms transfers between unlicensed sellers on the Internet or at gun shows. (Background checks are required for guns sold through licensed dealers, and 17 states have laws requiring background checks on at least handgun sales at gun shows. For more, read our recent fact-check.)","4175","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-the-brady-bill-and-instant-background-checks/"
"He voted in support of several amendments seeking to expand background checks through the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 after the Newtown, Conn., shootings. There is an important distinction here between the “instant background checks” he supported in the Brady bill. The background check provision in the post-Newtown legislation was to require a check through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for all firearm sales and to prohibit straw purchase firearms. Sanders supported this. The provision in the Brady bill essentially would have rendered background checks moot, because the technology did not exist at the time. Sanders also supported this.","4176","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-the-brady-bill-and-instant-background-checks/"
"He also supported a provision to allow people to carry firearms in checked baggage on Amtrak trains and to give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits “resulting from criminal or unlawful misuse” of their product by a third party.” (For the rest of his votes on gun policy, check out this extensive compilation by PolitiFact.)","4177","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-the-brady-bill-and-instant-background-checks/"

"Sanders has a complex history with gun policies, and for decades, it was not a priority issue for him. At the time, he did not offer many explanations for his votes against the Brady bill other than that he believed it was not a significant issue for his constituents, and that he wants waiting periods to be decided on a state level.","4180","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-the-brady-bill-and-instant-background-checks/"
"Now, on the presidential campaign trail, his defense has shifted. He instead points to his other votes, including his long-time support for instant background checks and expanded background checks. But this is misleading language. The instant background check provision in the Brady bill would have had quite a different — if not, almost the opposite — effect than the instant background check provision in the post-Newtown gun proposal. In effect, it would have killed the Brady bill. Yet to the public, this technical difference is not clear.","4181","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-the-brady-bill-and-instant-background-checks/"
"In the context of the Brady bill, “instant background checks” are a different provision than in the context of the Newtown bill.

"Despite Sanders’s rhetorical fire, he once again failed to demonstrate the range or the realism the presidency requires.

"Then, challenged to explain how he would make good on his rhetoric, Sanders repeated his lines about leading a “political revolution” in which Americans will press his agenda forward against the wishes of the billionaires. “What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need,” he said.","4217","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/15/can-anyone-really-imagine-bernie-sanders-in-the-white-house/"
"This is not a serious answer to a question about political reality, in large part because the billionaire class is not the only reason Congress wouldn’t ever approve his program. Sanders’s is a version of the same pitch we hear every four years from one presidential primary candidate or another: If we rise up, Americans will realize that they really agree with us, political incentives will reverse and we will have to compromise less.

"Hillary Clinton’s performance wasn’t as clean or as crisp as her last one. Among other things, she invoked 9/11 in order to dodge a question about her campaign donors. But she effectively made the case that, though Sanders speaks about important questions, his solutions are ultimately simplistic and hers are better. Instead of railing about breaking up the big banks, focus on identifying and moderating the biggest risks to the financial system. Instead of making college free for everyone, increase access to those who need it and decline to subsidize wealthy kids’ tuition.","4220","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/11/15/can-anyone-really-imagine-bernie-sanders-in-the-white-house/"

"But the South Carolina poll results are probably more important for understanding how the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination will play out next year. The graph below shows Sanders even with Clinton among white voters nationally and ahead with this group in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. It is not too surprising, then, that he is now winning the almost all-white early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.","4242","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/17/bernie-sanderss-surge-doesnt-mean-the-democratic-race-is-wide-open-heres-why/"
"The remaining columns of the display show Hillary Clinton dominating Sanders among non-white voters both nationally and in South Carolina. (YouGov did not report percentages by race in Iowa and New Hampshire because there were so few non-whites in the sample.) As the New York Times recently reported, the Clinton campaign is looking to such strong support in southern states with large minority electorates as a firewall against her rivals.","4243","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/17/bernie-sanderss-surge-doesnt-mean-the-democratic-race-is-wide-open-heres-why/"

"Many of the news stories that oversell Sanders’s chances suggest that this could actually happen. Obama, they point out, was losing African American support to Clinton by wide margins in polls conducted during the summer and fall of 2007 before going on to overwhelmingly win the black vote in the primaries. Or as the Huffington Post’s lead political story on Sunday put it, “He [Sanders] does have time on his side. This time in 2007, then-Sen. Barack Obama had yet to engage black voters in his campaign against Clinton, with many expressing skepticism toward his candidacy.”","4245","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/17/bernie-sanderss-surge-doesnt-mean-the-democratic-race-is-wide-open-heres-why/"
"Even setting aside Barack Obama’s unique potential to appeal to African American voters as a historic racial figure, this frequent comparison of Senator Obama in 2007 and Senator Sanders in 2015 is deeply flawed. Just looking at the data from eight years ago shows how much better positioned Barack Obama was in the summer months of 2007 to surpass Hillary Clinton with black voters than Bernie Sanders currently is.","4246","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/17/bernie-sanderss-surge-doesnt-mean-the-democratic-race-is-wide-open-heres-why/"

"So the challenge for Sanders is clear: a little knownsSenator, from an almost all-white state, who has been criticized by black activists for preaching a message of economic equality that ignores the historic and ongoing circumstances entangling race and class in the United States, somehow needs to galvanize minority support for his candidacy against an opponent who has been extremely popular with blacks and Latinos for over two decades.","4250","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/17/bernie-sanderss-surge-doesnt-mean-the-democratic-race-is-wide-open-heres-why/"
"Early wins by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire are unlikely to change that, too. Gary Hart, whose 1984 candidacy is often compared to Sanders’s current campaign, could not translate his better-than-expected strong showing in the Iowa caucuses and resounding victory in the New Hampshire primary into a broader coalition beyond his white base. Nor could Barack Obama’s early-state momentum erode Hillary Clinton’s strong support from Latinos in the 2008 primary.","4251","https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/17/bernie-sanderss-surge-doesnt-mean-the-democratic-race-is-wide-open-heres-why/"

"Yet many developed nations have some socialist policies within their free-market systems, in the form of basic services provided by the government. In many European countries, the government provides college education and child care. In the United Kingdom, the government provides medical care through the National Health Service.

"Still, Sanders's vocal embrace of socialism marks a radical change in tone from American politics.

"It's also a chance for Sanders to distinguish himself from President Obama and from Hillary Rodham Clinton, another Democratic presidential candidate.

"While Sanders would seek to raise taxes as president, his campaign has argued that his plans would save money for the middle class. For example, even if workers had to pay higher taxes, they wouldn't have to pay a monthly premium for health insurance sponsored by their employers. The government would cover them instead. By one estimate, a single-payer system would save money for 95 percent of Americans — although any such estimate is necessarily speculative and depends on the details of the system.","4281","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/19/how-bernie-sanderss-big-speech-could-change-your-view-of-democratic-socialism/"
"In any case, the simple fact that Sanders would have to raise taxes to fund his proposals is a major political obstacle.

In an August WaPo-ABC survey, 80 percent of Democrats had a favorable view of Clinton while 18 percent had an unfavorable one. Among liberals, 66 percent had a favorable view as compared to 33 percent who saw her in an unfavorable light.

"And yet, Clinton decided to reverse herself on TPP -- no matter what her campaign says, she was a supporter of the deal -- and take the flip-flopper flak rather than risk putting distance between herself and the party base. Worth noting: Vice President Biden, a longtime friend of organized labor, continues to mull a run for the Democratic nomination.

Sen. Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) all represent large swathes of the region. Manchin, who more regularly breaks from the Obama administration, faced a token 2012 opponent and won by a landslide. Casey and Brown drew flawed but well-funded opponents, and both saw their victory margins shrink, as Appalachian voters bolted to the GOP.

"America is more distant from the 1933 beginning of the New Deal (82 years) than that beginning was from the 1865 end of the Civil War (68 years). Both episodes involved the nation’s understanding of equality: The war affirmed equality of natural rights, the New Deal addressed unequal social conditions. Today’s Democratic Party is frozen, like a fly in amber, in the New Deal preoccupation — but with less excuse than Democrats had during the Great Depression. The party believes that economic inequality is an urgent problem, and that its urgency should be understood in terms of huge disparities of wealth. Neither proposition is (to use the term Jefferson used when he wrote equality into America’s catechism) a self-evident truth.","October 16","4345","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/economic-inequality-and-freedom/2015/10/16/db256346-7396-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"The fundamental producer of income inequality is freedom. Individuals have different aptitudes and attitudes. Not even universal free public education, even were it well done, could equalize the ability of individuals to add value to the economy. Besides, some people want to teach, others want to run hedge funds. In an open society, rewards are set not by political power but by impersonal market forces, the rewards of which will differ dramatically but usually predictably. Beyond freedom’s valuable fecundity in producing unequal social outcomes, four other facets of today’s America fuel inequality.","4346","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/economic-inequality-and-freedom/2015/10/16/db256346-7396-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"First, the entitlement state exists primarily to transfer wealth regressively, from the working-age population to the retired elderly who, after a lifetime of accumulation, are the wealthiest age cohort. Second, big, regulatory government inherently exacerbates inequality because it inevitably serves the strong — those sufficiently educated, affluent, articulate and confident to influence the administrative state’s myriad redistributive actions.","4347","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/economic-inequality-and-freedom/2015/10/16/db256346-7396-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Third, seven years of ZIRP — zero-interest-rate policy — have not restored the economic dynamism essential for social mobility but have had the intended effect of driving liquidity into equities in search of high yields, thereby enriching the 10 percent of Americans who own approximately 80 percent of the directly owned stocks. Also, by making big government inexpensive, low interest rates exacerbate the political class’s perennial disposition toward deficit spending. And little of the 2016 federal budget’s $283 billion for debt service will flow to individuals earning less than the median income.","4348","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/economic-inequality-and-freedom/2015/10/16/db256346-7396-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Fourth, family disintegration cripples the primary transmitter of social capital — the habits, mores, customs and dispositions necessary for seizing opportunities. When 72 percent of African American children and 53 percent of Hispanic children are born to unmarried women, and 40 percent of all births are to unmarried women, and a majority of all mothers under 30 are not living with the fathers of their children, the consequences for the life chances, and lifetime earnings, of millions of children are enormous.","4349","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/economic-inequality-and-freedom/2015/10/16/db256346-7396-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is doing well, if not good, by reducing the debate about equality to resentment of large fortunes. He should read Harry G. Frankfurt’s new book “On Inequality.” It is so short (89 pages) that even a peripatetic candidate can read it, and so lucid that he cannot miss its inconvenient point: “It is misguided to endorse economic egalitarianism as an authentic moral ideal.”","4350","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/economic-inequality-and-freedom/2015/10/16/db256346-7396-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"Frankfurt, a Princeton professor of philosophy emeritus, argues that economic inequality is not inherently morally objectionable. “To the extent that it is truly undesirable, it is on account of its almost irresistible tendency to generate unacceptable inequalities of other kinds.” These can include access to elite education, political influence and other nontrivial matters. But Frankfurt’s alternative to economic egalitarianism is the “doctrine of sufficiency,” which is that the moral imperative should be that everyone have enough .","4351","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/economic-inequality-and-freedom/2015/10/16/db256346-7396-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"
"The pursuit of increased economic equality might, but need not, serve the ethic of sufficiency. And this pursuit might distract people from understanding, and finding satisfaction with, “what is needed for the kind of life a person would most sensibly and appropriately seek.” This has nothing to do with “the quantity of money that other people happen to have.” Frankfurt argues that “doing worse than others does not entail doing badly.” And an obsession with others’ resources “contributes to the moral disorientation and shallowness of our time.”","4352","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/economic-inequality-and-freedom/2015/10/16/db256346-7396-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html"

"His message of economic populism and the ills of inequality includes a pledge to save the mail carrier’s door-to-door visit to every home, six days a week — a ritual in American life that’s increasingly viewed as quaint, outdated and unsustainable.","4368","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/09/bernie-sanderss-passion-for-the-prosaic-or-why-the-post-office-is-part-of-what-makes-america-great/"
"Sanders’s crusade to save the struggling U.S. Postal Service from extinction, which long predates his campaign for the Democratic nomination, is a powerful emblem of what he says can work in government as he fights against big banks, for a higher minimum wage and for more taxes on wealthy households and corporations.","4369","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/09/bernie-sanderss-passion-for-the-prosaic-or-why-the-post-office-is-part-of-what-makes-america-great/"
"“It’s the most visible symbol of government, every day,” says Warren Gunnels, Sanders’s policy director. “He strongly supports postal jobs, but overall he wants to maintain and improve the quality of service that has improved the lives of the American people for more than 200 years.”","4370","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/09/bernie-sanderss-passion-for-the-prosaic-or-why-the-post-office-is-part-of-what-makes-america-great/"

"The rise of e-mail and the Internet, along with a congressional mandate that forces the post office to pay $5.5 billion a year to pre-fund the health benefits of future retirees, are threatening the survival of the institution. Since 2007, it has been unable to cover its annual budget, 80 percent of which goes to labor costs. The losses have been staggering.","4372","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/09/bernie-sanderss-passion-for-the-prosaic-or-why-the-post-office-is-part-of-what-makes-america-great/"

"He doesn’t sit on any committees that oversee postal affairs. But Sanders has proposed legislation in the last two congresses to waive the prepayments for retirees. He’s pushing for the post office to be able to offer Americans basic financial services to raise revenue.

"“The beauty of the Postal Service is that it provides universal service six days a week to every corner of America, no matter how small or how remote,” he told the American Postal Workers Union’s all-craft meeting, which was held in Las Vegas. “It supports millions of jobs in virtually every sector of our economy. It provides decent-paying union jobs to some 500,000 Americans, and it is the largest employer of veterans.”","4379","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/09/bernie-sanderss-passion-for-the-prosaic-or-why-the-post-office-is-part-of-what-makes-america-great/"

"“Sanders sees the post office as a culturally democratizing force in America,” says Jim Sauber, an economist and chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers. “It fits right in with his democratic socialism.

"Sanders’s defense of postal issues is also economic. The Postal Service is the country’s second-largest civilian employer after Wal-Mart, moving 158 billion plus pieces of mail a year with a tiny amount of funding from Congress.","4384","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/09/bernie-sanderss-passion-for-the-prosaic-or-why-the-post-office-is-part-of-what-makes-america-great/"

"On the campaign trail, he’s calling for an expansion of what the post office does to include basic financial services like banking as an alternative to a predatory lending industry for low-income people. He also wants the Postal Service be permitted to set up Internet cafes, notarize documents, issue licenses and other stuff.","4386","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/09/bernie-sanderss-passion-for-the-prosaic-or-why-the-post-office-is-part-of-what-makes-america-great/"

"The board doesn’t have high visibility outside the postal world, but it approves high-dollar capital investments, sets mail prices, long-term strategies and legislative policies and signs union contracts. One nominee, James Miller III, advocated to privatize the Postal Service when he led the Office of Management and Budget during the Reagan administration. The other, Mickey Barnett, is a lobbyist for the payday loan industry. The candidates are anathema to the postal unions, which urged Sanders to block them.","4393","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/09/bernie-sanderss-passion-for-the-prosaic-or-why-the-post-office-is-part-of-what-makes-america-great/"

"This was Bernie Fest at the Cameo Gallery in Williamsburg, one of the handful of events put on by comics around the country and promoted on Sanders’s presidential Web site.

"When Sanders says — as he does in every speech — that he’s seeking to build “a revolution,” that’s not just rhetoric. What Sanders understands in his bones is that every period of progressive reform in U.S. history has come as a result of massive street heat, of energized movements that push policymaking elites to the left. Abolitionists pressured the Lincoln Republicans toward a policy of emancipation. Militant workers and a socialist left, whose general strikes shut down several major cities in 1934, prompted Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Democrats to legalize collective bargaining and create Social Security in 1935. The civil rights movement enabled the Kennedy-Johnson Democrats to pass the landmark legislation of the ’60s. Progressive reform doesn’t happen absent a large and vibrant left.","4460","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-say-you-want-a-revolution/2015/10/28/7ed69cfa-7da4-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html"
"A large and vibrant left, however, has been missing from the American political landscape since the ’60s. Precisely because Sanders has staked out the most distinctly leftist terrain of any major candidate in decades, and because so many Americans (young Americans in particular) have rallied to his cause, his campaign holds the promise of recreating that missing left.","4461","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-say-you-want-a-revolution/2015/10/28/7ed69cfa-7da4-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html"

"Problem is, progressive presidential candidacies seldom have consequential afterlives. Robert LaFollette’s 1924 independent campaign failed to create an ongoing institution. The Rainbow Coalition that emerged from Jesse Jackson’s campaigns in the ’80s never had the autonomy it needed to move beyond Jackson’s narrow post-campaign agendas. The millions of volunteers who helped make Barack Obama president were a loosely liberal group, not one of the left; never won any autonomy once Obama was elected; were called to action by the administration only for the safest of causes; and, unsurprisingly, didn’t turn out in significant numbers when called upon.","4463","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-say-you-want-a-revolution/2015/10/28/7ed69cfa-7da4-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html"
"Movements are built from the bottom up, not the top down. Nonetheless, Sanders’s campaign is the largest specifically left mobilization — and by “specifically left,” I mean it demands major changes in the distribution of income and wealth and major reforms to U.S. capitalism — that the nation has seen in at least a half-century. The question that looms before the campaign is less whether it can win Sanders the Democratic nomination, much less the presidency — goals that look, to put it mildly, daunting. Rather, it is whether its volunteers can help form an enduring left movement without which a future Democratic president and Congress won’t be able to enact even minor changes to income distribution or minor reforms to a capitalism that erodes the middle class.","4464","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-say-you-want-a-revolution/2015/10/28/7ed69cfa-7da4-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html"
"The programmatic substance of such a movement isn’t hard to arrive at. Steeply progressive taxation that could make college and retirement more affordable and rebuild our now second-rate infrastructure, legislation mandating more worker voice and power in their companies, a faster shift away from fossil fuels, greater protection for reproductive rights, reforming police practices, granting legal status to undocumented immigrants, regulating drug prices, reining in the banks — the causes are already there. But forging a movement from a campaign, and building it in tandem with the many progressive constituencies that for any number of reasons have not flocked to Sanders’s standard and are not likely to — that’s the hard part. Devilishly hard.","4465","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-say-you-want-a-revolution/2015/10/28/7ed69cfa-7da4-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html"
"This formidable task requires, first, that Sanders’s legions understand the unique historic opportunity that their coming together presents: That their victory in all probability won’t be putting Bernie in the White House, but creating a surging and enduring left. That, in turn, requires them to give as much thought to forming or joining autonomous post-campaign organizations, and envisioning post-campaign mobilizations, as they now do to advancing Sanders’s candidacy. Indeed, they need to start forming such organizations today, while they are together campaigning for Sanders, and in the process even reach out to other progressives who may not be for Sanders. These endeavors can’t and shouldn’t be undertaken by the Sanders campaign itself. They fall exclusively to the volunteers.","4466","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-say-you-want-a-revolution/2015/10/28/7ed69cfa-7da4-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html"

But again, the gap between Obama and McCain in the polls do fall within the margin of error.","4558","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/19/what-kennedys-catholic-speech-and-obamas-race-speech-say-about-sanderss-socialism-speech/"

"But there's also more recent data pointing to the importance of familiarity -- and maybe, an effort to explain. Here is what we know about what Americans tell pollsters they think about electing say, a woman, an African American, a Catholic, a Muslim -- or a socialist. A pretty big takeway here: The groups for which the vast majority of Americans say that they would not have a problem supporting include groups that Americans have now seen run for the White House, seen them participate in public life in various public offices.","4560","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/19/what-kennedys-catholic-speech-and-obamas-race-speech-say-about-sanderss-socialism-speech/"

"And while polls perhaps don't matter to Sander's supporters, it's also worth noting that socialists came in at the bottom of that June 2015 list. That's just the plain and simple truth. Now, we'll have to see what Sanders says.","4562","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/19/what-kennedys-catholic-speech-and-obamas-race-speech-say-about-sanderss-socialism-speech/"
"Bernie Sanders's campaign released a strategy memo to reporters on Wednesday aimed at pushing back at the notion that he is losing ground in his primary challenge to Hillary Clinton. One argument in it stood out to me: Sanders is a better general-election candidate than Clinton.","November 19","4563","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"Here's the essence of the Sanders camp's argument:","4564","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"Twenty two points! 40 points! President Sanders, here we come!","4565","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"Ahem. A little clarification is in order.","4566","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"The ""wide margins"" that the Sanders camp cites are tied to favorable/unfavorable numbers, not head-to-head horse-race ones. So, yes, according to a recent WaPo-ABC News poll, Sanders has ""only"" a net negative 30 favorable (26 fav/56 unfav) score among Republicans while Clinton has a net negative 70 (15 fav/85 unfav). But, this assertion — ""The fact that Sanders is seen in such a different light by Republicans indicates he has more potential to win a larger share of Republican voters in a general election than does Clinton"" — is a bridge way too far.","4567","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"Presidential elections are the most polarizing campaigns that exist in America. People retreat to their partisan camp and stay there. In 2012, President Obama won 8 percent of Republicans while Mitt Romney took just 7 percent of the vote among Democrats, according to exit polls. Four years earlier, Obama won 9 percent of Republicans while John McCain took 10 percent of Democrats. There's just no real crossover vote in a presidential election.","4568","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"Clinton's numbers, because of her longtime national profile, have that partisanship already baked in. She's totally known and totally divisive. Democrats like-to-love her; Republicans don't. Nothing will change about those numbers between now and next November.","4569","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"Sanders, on the other hand, isn't nearly as well known or well defined as Clinton. Up until six months ago, he was the answer to a Senate trivia question — nothing more. The Sanders campaign seems to be mistaking Republicans not really having a strong impression of the senator from Vermont to him having a genuine chance of winning any decent chunk of Republican voters as the Democratic nominee. (There's a big portion of the memo dedicated to how Sanders does better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups with the most likely Republican nominees.)","4570","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"That's almost certainly not the case. If Sanders did wind up as the Democratic nominee, tens of millions would be spent by conservative groups familiarizing Republican voters with his record — which begins with the fact that he is an avowed democratic socialist. While that's probably enough to take Sanders's Republican support to absolute zero, just in case it didn't, Republicans could run an ad excerpting from this September Wall Street Journal story headlined ""Price Tag of Bernie Sanders’s Proposals: $18 Trillion."" And that would just about do it for Sanders's hopes among Republicans.","4571","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"Is it possible that even with his socialism and his proposals for massive increases in government spending, Sanders still might be a less polarizing figure than Clinton among Republicans? Sure. But we are talking about slices of an onion in terms of the difference.","4572","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
"There's a case to be made by Sanders against Clinton in a Democratic primary fight — namely that she has demonstrated a lack of sufficient commitment to liberal principles during her time in public life. That's sellable to a wide swath of Democrats. The argument that Sanders's is a stronger general-election candidate than Clinton just isn't.","4573","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/19/bernie-sanders-says-hes-more-electable-than-hillary-clinton-um/"
