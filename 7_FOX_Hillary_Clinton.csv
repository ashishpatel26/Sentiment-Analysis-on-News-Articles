"State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf released a statement early Thursday saying, ""The State Department will review for public release the emails provided by Secretary Clinton to the Department, using a normal process that guides such releases.

"The controversy began Monday after The New York Times reported that Clinton had never had an official government email account for conducting official business. The practice is a potential violation of federal law, and has also raised questions of why Clinton went to such lengths to keep her messages off government servers.","5","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/05/hillary-clinton-says-asked-state-department-to-make-emails-public.html"
"The Times reported that members of the Benghazi committee initially discovered that Clinton had used a private e-mail account during her tenure at Foggy Bottom. The paper also said that Clinton had turned over 55,000 messages that had been selected by her advisers to the State Department in response to a records request. Clinton's Twitter post appeared to refer to those messages, about 300 of which are related to the Benghazi attack.","6","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/05/hillary-clinton-says-asked-state-department-to-make-emails-public.html"

"Meanwhile, the AP said it was considering legal action under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act against the State Department for failing to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat after waiting more than one year.

"Clinton still has not described her motivation for using a private email account -- hdr22(at)clintonemail.com, which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym -- for official State Department business. However, a Clinton aide told Fox News she was not bucking the system, and in fact was keeping with what former secretaries of state had done, including Colin Powell. The aide stressed that Clinton quickly responded to the request from the department for her emails, following updated guidance from the government's central records office.","10","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/05/hillary-clinton-says-asked-state-department-to-make-emails-public.html"
"The White House has deferred the question of whether any laws were broken to the State Department.

"But he also reiterated that the administration gave ""very specific guidance"" that employees should use official accounts when conducting government business, which Clinton did not do.

"Buzz Cut: • Hillary retreats deeper into cocoon • Boehner lays down ObamaCare replacement marker • Romney gets loose in Mississippi • As many as 6 million will pay ObamaCare tax • Ageism claims Dippy","16","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/29/hillary-retreats-deeper-into-cocoon.html"
"HILLARY RETREATS DEEPER INTO COCOON With the conventional wisdom on the left congealing against the idea of even a symbolic challenge to Hillary Clinton’s march to the Democratic nomination, her team is now publicly toying with the idea of continuing to delay the official launch until the middle of summer. On Monday, the campaign offered a sneak peak to Politico, indicating that the campaign would come out of the shadows in April. In what appears to be a rebuttal to the staff assumptions from “a Democrat familiar with Clinton’s thinking,” the news site reports today that “the actual kickoff would be in July.” Clinton would submit to partial scrutiny from the Federal Elections Commission starting in April, the story says, but would keep most of her operation off the books until the beginning of July. The stated reason: the candidate wants “develop her message, policy and organization.” Because the previous 14 years of running for president haven’t given them enough time to nail it down… [Additional white dudes retained - Politico also reports that two 2012 Obama digital gurus are at the top of the list for Hillary’s campaign-in-waiting, Teddy Goff and Andrew Bleeker.] So who cares? - The money line in the rebuttal from whoever Politico was quoting in throne room is this: “[Clinton] doesn’t feel under any pressure, and they see no primary challenge on the horizon. If you have the luxury of time, you take it.” This should terrify Democrats. If the campaign cocoon is so dense and so deep that courtiers are publicly quibbling in the press about the right moment for the monarch butterfly to emerge, they are farther out of touch with reality than even previous reporting had indicated. But if this really is Clinton herself speaking through an emissary, it would suggest the kind of stage fright that foretells a risk-averse, bloodless, pre-fab campaign. Sound familiar? Those were the hallmarks of Clinton’s losing endeavor in 2008 and, if the leaks are to be believed, the tendencies have deepened in the past seven years. Clinton’s book tour showed not a candidate who was “rusty” but one who was unwilling to acknowledge political reality. A rusty candidate might complain about being “dead broke.” But only an arrogant one would insist that she was right to say so. [“The same old candidates running for President #ThingsToRunFrom” – Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Twitter] Deflate - The first hazard of being so blithe as to say Clinton “doesn’t feel any pressure” is that it would not take long for a Democratic revolt to spring up. The presumptive nominee could be caught unawares, like this guy. While Clinton would be hard to stop from seizing the nomination, the effort of quelling an insurrection might be a strain. The other, larger, hazard is that this trend depicts a candidate who will not be ready to meet the challenges of the general election. The longer Clinton stays inside the palace, hiding her treasury and ducking behind her retainers, the harder her eventual emergence will be. She should be feeling pressure – the same pressure that drove Jeb Bush to get off the couch before Christmas. Many consultants make their livings by soothing and reassuring candidates. And with a $2 billion pot of cash at hand, there will be no shortage of people around who encourage Clinton to believe that she is a perfect and wonderful creation who only needs to be more like herself to win. That’s what losing campaigns often do. [In the latest Fox News poll, only 24 percent of voters agreed with President Obama’s sentiment in the State of the Union describing America as “tight-knit” while 73 percent see the country as dysfunctional.] BOEHNER LAYS DOWN OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT MARKER In an interview with Fox News “Special Report” anchor Bret Baier Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner assured that a Republicans alternative to ObamaCare is in the works and will be forthcoming from Congress. It’s no secret that GOP lawmakers have struggled in coalescing around an alternative due to what Boehner recently described as “a lot of divergent views.” Referring to an interview with CBS last week where the speaker was asked about a prospective GOP plan, Baier observed: “You said you didn’t have one. Will you by the end of this Congress? “There are three committee chairmen that have the jurisdiction over the health care policy in our country.” Boehner explained, “And those three chairmen are working together to craft what we believe would be a better approach with regard to health care for the American people than ObamaCare.” “So there will be one alternative?” Baier pressed. “There will be an alternative and you’ll get to see it,” Boehner replied. Watch the interview here. [WashEx’s Philip Klein examines the 5 biggest obstacles to agreement on a Republican alternative to ObamaCare: “the problem isn’t that Republicans haven’t released any healthcare plans, but that they’ve had trouble rallying around a single one due to some fundamental differences.

Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers; Jeff Brown, a finance professor at the University of Illinois who also served on the Council under Bush; and Warren Payne, who was policy director under former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp [R-Mich.].” [In the latest Fox News poll, 64 percent of voters feel the country is still in a recession yet 58 percent of voters are optimistic about the economy.]","17","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/29/hillary-retreats-deeper-into-cocoon.html"

Daniel Webster and Richard Nugent won’t be getting their seats back on the Rules Committee, The Hill has learned.” CRUZ SHOVES MCCONNELL ON A.G. NOMINATION Roll Call: “Sen. Ted Cruz [R-Texas] called attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch’s immigration views ‘dangerous’ Wednesday and questioned whether Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [R-Ky.] should even have the chamber consider her nomination. ‘That is the decision the majority leader is going to have to make. I believe we should use every constitutional tool available to stop the president’s unconstitutional executive action. That’s what Republicans, Republican candidates all over the country said over and over again last year,’ the Texas Republican said in a brief interview with CQ Roll Call as the daylong Judiciary Committee hearing on Lynch’s nomination neared conclusion.” [In the latest Fox News poll, the majority of voters say the White House has mostly failed on priorities including illegal immigration at 64 percent, economic improvement at 52 percent failed the economy and making the country safer at 49 percent.] “I would just say that fundamentally [Loretta Lynch] openly advocated for the providing of scarce jobs in America to those who are here illegally.” --Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., on “The Kelly File” Watch here. FEDS: UP TO 6 MILLION WILL PAY OBAMACARE TAX The Hill: “As many as 6 million people will have to pay a penalty under ObamaCare for going without health insurance in 2014, federal officials suggested in projections released Wednesday. That means between 2 percent and 4 percent of all taxpayers lacked medical coverage for all or part of the year and do not qualify for an exemption under the individual mandate, according to the Treasury Department. Another 10 to 20 percent of taxpayers, or 15 million to 30 million people, were uninsured but will qualify for an exemption from the mandate, shielding them from paying $95 or 1 percent of household income when they file their taxes. Wednesday's estimates are the clearest picture so far from the administration ahead of ObamaCare's first tax season.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... This year’s breakout film at the Sundance Film Festival, Tangerine, is full of surprises according to The Verge, from the story in front of the camera to the shooting behind the camera. The camera in question wasn’t even a camera but an iPhone 5S. Plenty of films have been made with iPhones but this is by far the most successful and first to make it to Sundance. The decision to use iPhones was made to accommodate the independent film’s small budget according to director Sean Baker, saying “It was surprisingly easy. We never lost any footage.” Baker and his team used three phones, an $8 app called Filmic Pro that allowed more control over focus, aperture and color, a Steadicam and an adapter lens to attach to the iPhone. “These phones, because they’re so light, and they’re so small, a human hand, no matter how stable you are, it will shake. And it won’t look good.” The lenses were the key ingredient to make the movie look fit for the big screen. “To tell you the truth, I wouldn’t have even made the movie without it,” Baker says.

He said that Clinton, the presumed front-runner for the Democratic nomination, ‘cluelessly pressed a reset button for Russia, which smiled and then invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation.’ Calling Obama’s recent State of the Union address ‘naïve at best and deceptive at worst,’ he criticized the foreign policy of both Obama and Clinton.” [Mitt has edge in S.C. poll - [Charleston] Post and Courier: “The telephone survey of 831 likely GOP primary voters was conducted last week by Gravis Marketing of Florida.

Jeb Bush will headline the Republican National Committee’s spring retreat, the committee announced Monday in an email to supporters…The meeting will be held March 20-22 at the Waldorf Astoria resort in Boca Raton, Fla., for major donors to the Republican Majority Fund, a joint fundraising committee that supported Republican Senate candidates and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.” Southern Soiree – Gov.

Scott Walker’s [R] new leadership committee takes a shot at Hillary Clinton with its first ad. The two-minute ad, titled ‘Our American Revival,’ describes President Obama as a failed leader and offers a warning about looking to the past for answers. ‘America stands on the brink, at a time and place in our history where failed leaders preside over a nation adrift,’ a male narrator says in the ad. It criticizes Obama for a foreign policy ‘that projects weakness abroad.’ ‘America can't stop this by looking to the past,’ the ad continues as a picture of Clinton is shown, ‘or for answers in Washington, D.C.’” Futurist - AP: “Walker told reporters in Racine, Wisconsin, that he's setting up the committee to see if his ideas resonate with voters. He also said he planned trips to important primary states including Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada and Florida in the coming weeks and months. ‘If we see that’s a message that resonates, that would probably encourage us to go forward,’ Walker said…He took a dig at potential Republican candidates Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, as well as Democrat Hillary Clinton, without mentioning any of them by name. ‘They want new, fresh leadership, particularly if Republicans are going to take on a candidate from the past.’” Huckabee pummels Politico - Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee took Politico to task for misquoting him in a splashy article headlined: ‘Mike Huckabee complains of ‘trashy’ women at Fox News.’ There’s just one problem, Huckabee never said it. The article referenced a recent radio interview in which Huckabee was talking about his recent book on values. “I never said anything about the women of Fox News,” Huckabee told one such woman, Megyn Kelly, on Wednesday’s edition “The Kelly File.” “It was an utterly fabricated lie on the part of the writer at Politico. There’s no way it could have been fabricated unless he was just too lazy to read the chapter in the book he was trying to talk about,” Huckabee said.

Rand Paul’s house. The Kentucky Republican has a warning for any unmanned drones that may fly near his house: ‘I've got a shotgun,’ he told CNN. When asked about the legality of drones or if they should be banned, Paul said, ‘Drones should only be used according to the Constitution. But if they fly over my house, they better beware because I've got a shotgun,’ he added. The questioned was prompted after an off-duty officer with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency crashed a drone on the White House lawn early Monday morning after reportedly drinking while flying it. Paul also said ‘maybe’ when asked if he wanted to live at the White House, but added the fence needs to be better guarded.” Pence laments faux news idea - Indianapolis Star: “Gov.

Beyond parody - “#mediabuzz” host Howard Kurtz rips into Al-Jazeera’s English outlet for banning the use of the word “terrorist” to describe Islamist militants who carry out attacks like the one in Paris this month: “This is the worst kind of political correctness, an effort to avoid calling out crimes against humanity in the name of linguistic neutrality.” ERIC CANTOR FINALLY GETS INTO HARVARD “Harvard’s Institute of Politics (IOP), at the John F.

AGEISM CLAIMS DIPPY The Mirror in England reports that an iconic member of the Natural History Museum is forcing the retirement of Dippy the Diplodocus. The dinosaur skeleton has been in the museum for over 100 years but is being forced out because he was deemed “no longer relevant” for the natural world today. In the summer of 2017, a real whale skeleton will be suspended from the ceiling of Hintze Hall. Meanwhile Dippy, a plaster replica skeleton, will be preserved for a possible tour of England. The change is part of a “decade of transformation” according to director Sir Michael Dixon. “As the largest known animal to have ever lived on Earth, the story of the blue whale reminds us of the scale of our responsibility to the planet. This is an important and necessary change,” he said. The female blue whale arrived at the museum just 10 years after opening in 1891 but remained in storage until 1938 while Dippy was first put on display in 1905 after a donation by American millionaire Andrew Carnegie. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “[The Taliban] slits throats, it attacks buses, it drives car bombs into markets and it's not a terrorist group? Look, you can't parody this administration.

Obama has pretended that the war on terror, the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq are all winding down and the wars are all back.

"SCANDALS SKEWER HILLARY IN SWING STATES As news of another suspect foreign entanglement hits Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a new survey shows how damaging the fallout from her scandal twin-bill of secret email servers and foreign buckraking have been. A Quinnipiac University poll out today says Clinton’s lead is collapsing against leading Republican presidential candidates in the critical swing states of Colorado, Iowa and Virginia. The size of the drop from Q’s mid-February survey, coupled with gains by the entire GOP field leads the pollster to conclude, “[I]t is difficult to see Secretary Clinton’s slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail.” Respondents in all three states say she is not honest and trustworthy. Nasty numbers - In matchups, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., drew 44 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent in Colorado, as he and 5 other GOP hopefuls statistically tied the Democratic frontrunner. In Iowa, Paul at 43 percent, has a numerical edge over Clinton’s 42 percent, with the rest of the field effectively tied or close. Clinton fared better in Virginia, with a 47 to 43 percent lead over Paul, her closest GOP rival. About that email policy… - WaPo: “…Clinton has hired a longtime Google executive to oversee her likely presidential campaign's technology development and build new ways for Clinton to engage with voters, according to Democrats with knowledge of the move. Stephanie Hannon, who is Google's director of product management for civic innovation and social impact, will become the chief technology officer of the expected Clinton campaign…’ Move in day? - In a signal a campaign announcement is nearing from Hillary Clinton, sources tell Fox News some staffers for the former Secretary of State started moving into her Brooklyn, N.Y. headquarters Wednesday. [Watch Fox: Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry is in Iowa examining the groundwork being laid by Clinton.] RAND HITS BACK HARD ON ABORTION During a campaign stop in Milford, N.H., Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., responded to a question about a testy exchange he had with an AP reporter about abortion policy. Paul’s retort: “You go back and go ask (DNC head) Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she’s OK with killing a 7-pound baby that's just not born yet.” Paul added, “Ask her when life begins, and ask Debbie when she’s willing to protect life. When you get an answer from Debbie, come back to me.” Wasserman Schultz shot back responding, “I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved. Period. End of story.” Zero exceptions? - “It’s disturbing to know that the Chairwoman of the DNC supports zero protections for the life of an unborn child, not even in the final days before birth. We should be willing to protect the innocent. Do her fellow Democrats share their party chair’s position, which is out-of-step with the majority of American women?”—Republican National Committee Press Secretary, Allison Moore in a statement. [According to the most recent Gallup Poll, only 28 percent of respondents believe abortion should be legal under “any circumstance.”] ‘People want someone who will stand up’ - During an appearance on “The Kelly File” Wednesday night Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., defended his demeanor in recent interviews telling host Megyn Kelly, “Do I think that I responded appropriately? You know, I would rather not have contentious interviews. I would rather do 30 minutes with Charlie Rose laid back in a La-Z-Boy chair. I know, but we only get a few minutes. There’s not a lot of time for niceties.” Paul went on to say, “I think also that people want someone who will stand up and not just roll over and take it.” The Hill: “Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has raised $1 million in donations through his website to a day after officially launching his presidential campaign.” NRA snubs Christie and Rand - The Tennessean: “A dozen or so possible Republican presidential candidates are set to speak in Nashville on Friday at the National Rifle Association's annual convention — but the lineup is missing two big names. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky…Neither were invited to addresses the NRA’s Leadership Forum, NRA officials confirmed to The Tennessean. … Christie… was given a ‘C’ by the NRA in 2013, prior to his re-election. Earlier that year, Christie blasted the NRA for airing what he called a ‘reprehensible’ television ad that mentioned the daughters of President Barack Obama.” [Why would the NRA exclude Paul, whose record on gun rights is pristine?

Pro-military appeal in the Palmetto State- The [South Carolina] Herald: “Some prominent Palmetto State Republicans will accompany White House hopeful Rand Paul when he launches his South Carolina primary race Thursday at the U.S.S. Yorktown. For the U.S. senator from Kentucky, who is trying to dispel concerns that he is too isolationist, the choice of the aircraft carrier as a backdrop offers the chance to appeal to pro-military S.C. voters. U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., and state Sen. Tom Davis are expected to give remarks at Paul’s event. U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., will not attend but has contributed a video.” WALKER: OBAMA HAS NO BUSINESS ‘SCHOOLING ANYONE’ ON FOREIGN POLICY Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., shot back at President Obama’s criticism of his foreign policy experience during an appearance on “Hannity” Wednesday. “This is a guy who has the audacity to be talking about schooling anyone when it comes to foreign policy and not just about Israel and nuclear weapons,” Walker told host Sean Hannity. “The thing about that statement, a guy in the last year called ISIS, the jayvee squad, his administration continues to call Yemen a success story, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave Russia a reset button.” Watch the interview here.

Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., released a Web ad Wednesday comparing the threat of Islamic jihad to a rattlesnake. Huckabee appears in the ad saying: “As a kid growing up in South Arkansas, one thing I learned about rattlesnakes is you don’t get in their head and try and figure out why they want to bite you, you don’t try and have a conversation with them, you don’t negotiate with them…you take their heads off with a .410 shotgun or a hoe before they bite you.” Sixteeners hail homeschooling in the Hawkeye State - Former Gov.

Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar will join Gov. Huckabee earlier in the day to promote school choice and his conservative vision for education.

The Sierra Club has a goal of replacing half the nation's coal plants with renewable energy by 2017.” The Judge’s Ruling: Unneeded solution - With respect to Indiana’s original Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano observes, “If the Indiana legislature wanted to bring back the bad old days with respect to sexual orientation and public accommodations, one can understand the firestorm it got. If it was just trying to boast that it was defending the same religious liberties the Constitution already requires it to defend, its efforts were clumsy, unnecessary and wasteful.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE For many of the planets in our solar system we have the Greeks and Romans to thank for their names. For example, Jupiter is named after Zeus and its moons for his conquests. This holds true for nearly every planet in our solar system except for Uranus, whose names can be traced to the plays of Shakespeare. So how did the earth’s moon get such a seemingly generic name? Gizmodo explains: “The word ‘moon’ can be traced back to Old English, where it is said to have derived from the Proto-Germanic word ‘menon’, which in turn derived from the Proto-Indo-European ‘menses,’ meaning ‘month, moon.’ This highlights how far back the association between the Moon and the passage of time goes.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

A political conflict over slavery sewn into the very soil from which the republic would grow proved too much for our system. After two generations of civic strife, war erupted in South Carolina on April 12, 1861. It would last until this date in 1865, with the surrender of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, Va. It was Palm Sunday in a tiny, dusty hamlet, unremarkable except for its railroad depot. Some 620,000 Americans had been killed in the previous four years. And it could fairly be said that their cause of death was political failure. That’s why the sesquicentennial of the end of the Civil War ought to be a somber moment for Americans today. We live with an increasingly failed political system and a society that shows deepening intolerance of the views of others. Public discourse of substance on any controversial topic is seemingly impossible. We are losing the tether. That’s not to say that we are on the brink of a new civil war, but it is undeniable that the path to national dissolution ran through hateful discourse and broken, insufficient politics. And that is to say nothing of the insult paid to those war dead by the individuals today who so roughly handle the institutions and culture that history show to be rare, precious and alarmingly fragile. Appomattox 101 - Lee’s army had been on the run since the beginning of the month after it had been forced from its lines at Petersburg, Va. The once-fearsome force, a shell of its former self, was moving west to Appomattox to obtain a stockpile of desperately needed weapons and ammunition. On April 7, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant wrote Lee prodding for surrender. “The results of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia,” Grant wrote. He added that any further effusion of blood would be Lee’s responsibility. Lee did not yield, but did seek to find what conditions Grant would offer. On Apr. 8, Lee had plotted one final route of escape. After initial successes on April 9, he found himself trapped. It was then Lee knew what he had to do. He telegraphed Grant seeking a meeting to discuss surrender. Fittingly, but quite by happenstance, officers chose the home of Wilmer McLean, who had moved from Northern Virginia early in the war to escape the fighting, for the parley. Grant, still wearing a mud-spattered uniform, proved to be gracious and generous in his terms of surrender. He permitted Confederate soldiers to keep their horses for the upcoming planting season. Officers were allowed to keep their side-arms and baggage. After receiving parole, the Army of Northern Virginia was allowed to return home without any stigma of treason. Grant also provided rations for Lee’s starving men. Upon returning to his troops Lee said, “Men, we have fought through the war together. I have done the best I could for you. My heart is too full to say more.” Syllabus - If today’s anniversary has you in the mood to dive deeper on the topic, here are ten of the finest books on the subject of the Civil War, compiled with some kind help from readers, via Twitter.

"HILLARY’S EMAIL SCANDAL INTENSIFIES STORM Consider this: When Hillary Clinton made the choice to dodge the rules and exclusively use a private email account for official business as secretary of state, she knew that today would come. But she must have determined that the bad press she would get for being secretive and unaccountable would be worth the advantages of secrecy and control. This is different than her ongoing fundraising controversies. Clinton’s defenders can argue that the presumptive Democratic nominee’s decision to allow her family foundation to take contributions from undesirable foreign governments was the result of Clinton caring too deeply about the sick and impoverished and lacking a foresight about the public backlash. This is very different. The WaPo reports that Clinton apparently made the decision to skirt federal requirements even before her Senate confirmation hearings for the post began. Knowing the turmoil this would cause, Clinton necessarily assumed that the scandal would be worth being able to hide her electronic tracks. [Politico seeks to explain the series of stumbles by Team Hillary in recent weeks by citing a lack of adequate staffing. Along the way, the piece sheds some light on the warring factions inside the $2 billion enterprise that continues to pit President Obama’s team against Clinton’s core.]","104","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/03/hillarys-email-scandal-intensifies-storm.html"
"Bad timing - What Clinton could not have foreseen is that the revelation would come at the most damaging moment imaginable. The news comes not only as outrage simmers over her foundation’s sketchy practices but also as Clinton returns to Washington and the political sphere tonight to rally her supporters at EMILY’S List, the pro-choice group that is tasked with waging war on Clinton’s potential opponents on gender issues. The bombshell about secret emails at the State Department also hits on the day the foreign policy she helped craft faces intense scrutiny with the arrival of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a last-ditch bid to head off a nuclear deal with Iran. Her public presence on the same day as Netanyahu’s speech was tough enough. A public appearance on the day of the most significant scandal yet surrounding her second presidential run is just a disaster. [Daily Caller reports that the Department of Justice shut down attempts to search off-site storage facilities for Lois Lerner’s missing emails claiming that opponents shouldn’t have even known these facilities and tapes even existed.] Cui bono? - Clinton’s team is adamant that their candidate complied with the intent of the law that required the former secretary to conduct business on her government account. Their argument is that by providing copies of the emails to other officials that the government already has Clinton is in the clear. Then why the private account? And what was left out of the document dump the Clinton campaign unloaded on the government? Are there emails about the debacle in Libya? Are there emails to unsavory individuals or groups? And the questions will go on and on. An audacious, premeditated decision to skirt sunlight laws and accountability measures is hardly the thing that Clinton needs at a moment when doubts about her ethics were already mounting. JEB LOOKS TO EASE CONSERVATIVE WORRIES Las Vegas Review-Journal: “Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday told a crowd of about 400 people in Las Vegas that he applies conservative values, not just talks about them, as he seriously considers a run for president in 2016. Bush said he’s done something ‘that is kind of unusual in Washington world,’ He’s had the chance to sign the front side of a paycheck and experience how businesses are formed, how jobs are created and how risk-takers, looking to create businesses, are important for the economy. He also talked about his accomplishments in Florida during eight years as governor…” Jeb mum on donor meetings - AP: “Bush was scheduled to be in Las Vegas through Tuesday afternoon. His team acknowledged he had other private meetings while in Las Vegas - including some focused on raising money - but declined to provide further details. The city is home to several prominent Republican donors, including Las Vegas Sands Corp. CEO Sheldon Adelson, who was in Washington on Monday to attend a speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Bush said he monitored Netanyahu’s speech, which Bush described as ‘classy.’” [WaPo: “Former Vice President Dan Quayle is set to co-host a fundraiser in Arizona [today] for a super PAC backing Jeb Bush, one of a series of high-dollar events that the former Florida governor is headlining as he mulls a possible presidential bid.] Prepares to press the flesh in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Bush, a former Florida governor, will mingle with Iowans at a barbecue restaurant in Waukee and a pizza restaurant in Cedar Rapids, as well as at a fundraiser in Urbandale and a big multi-contender political event in Des Moines, as previously reported…Bush has now scheduled two more events: He will meet privately with Iowa activists, volunteers and GOP campaign veterans on Saturday afternoon at Jethro’s BBQ 'n Jambalaya in Waukee. On Saturday night, he’ll do a public meet-and-greet at the Pizza Ranch at 2450 Westdale Drive SW in Cedar Rapids.” IS WALKER PEAKING TOO SOON? Noting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s surge in popularity as well as his trip-ups, goateed eminence Jonah Goldberg questions whether the potential 2016 GOP contender’s timing is off: “In countless discussions I had at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference – as well as among people I’ve talked to who attended the Club for Growth meeting in Florida this weekend — the concern for friends, and the hope for foes, is that Walker is peaking too soon.” Rand looks to blunt critics on Israel - Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is out with a new video today that includes some tough talk on national defense and his opposition to foreign aid for hostile governments. It is part of an effort to rebut critical coverage of his foreign policy like this piece from Buzzfeed: “‘If you have to give money to Israel, I’m all for people donating and giving money to Israel but we don’t have money for any of those subsidies, it’s gone,’ Paul told blogger Mica Sims in 2010. ‘We have to borrow money from China to give it to other countries. It makes no sense whatsoever from a fiscal standpoint.’” Cruz auditions for Adelson with tough talk on Iran - National Journal: “The meeting room on Capitol Hill was packed, but for Ted Cruz’s presidential ambitions, one person stood out. At a panel discussion sponsored by pro-Israel group This World: The Values Network on Monday afternoon, the Texas senator aggressively voiced his view that Iran should not gain nuclear capabilities. It was an opportunity for Cruz, an almost-certain presidential contender, to make his case to casino magnate, GOP mega-donor and audience member Sheldon Adelson, whose fundraising decisions are heavily influenced by candidates’ support for the security of Israel, for 2016 support.” Kasich on hand for Bibi talk - Columbus Dispatch: “Gov. John Kasich, who this month was in the key presidential primary state of South Carolina, will attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial speech [today] before a joint session of Congress.” Lindsey raises cash on Bibi speech - WaPo: “If you’re not a member of Congress who plans to be there in person, the place to be is the Capitol Hill Club, a GOP social club where Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is holding a speech-watching luncheon that doubles as a fundraiser for his new political committee. ” Perry finds a PAC man - NYT: “Rick Perry … is moving to establish a “super PAC” to back his effort, and has turned to Austin Barbour, a Mississippi-based lobbyist and political operative to head it, according to three people with knowledge of the moves..” Carson makes it official - WSJ: “Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has formally created an exploratory committee to run for president, his campaign chief executive, Terry Giles, said Monday. …With the exploratory committee, Mr. Carson can raise money that he can transfer to his campaign once it begins.” SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX “If the party cannot get together quickly behind one candidate it will be another long eight years with Hillary and Bill to stomach. Scott Walker is the closest to fitting the bill with either [Marco Rubio] or [Carly Fiorina] as the VP running mate.” --Bill Norwood, Ozark, Mo. “I was a [Chris Christie] fan, but have lost interest. Not one of the other candidates, including Jeb, is acerbic enough to duke it out with Hillary’s smarmy cadre of millennial ‘talking pointers.’ Rand Paul has the venom, but he cannot win. Count me as thumbs up to [Gov. Scott Walker] and [Carly Fiorina]!!” --Brooke Samuelson, Windsor, Conn. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... This day in 1845 marks the first time Congress used the Constitutional provision allowing Congressional veto overrides. It was an attempt to rein in President John Tyler’s eager use of presidential veto power. Two weeks prior, Tyler had vetoed a bill that would have denied him the ability to provide funds for cutter ships without Congressional approval. Congress insisted on legislative approval before the commissioning of any new military craft. Tyler’s use of the veto, at 10 times, was only second only to President Andrew Jackson who used it 12 times during his administration. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 45 percent//Disapprove – 50.4 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 32.2 percent//Wrong Track – 59.2 percent SHIFT IN CHRISTIAN VOTERS HELPS EXPLAIN DEMS’ BIBI SNUB There was a time that the idea of nearly 60 Democrats boycotting a speech to Congress by the prime minister of Israel would have been unimaginable. Democrats were the staunchest supporters of the creation and defense of the Jewish state. Republicans were once lukewarm. Now, Democrats increasingly side against Israel, while Republicans are nearly unanimous in support. So how did we get here? Part of it is pique. Some of the speech snubbers are Obama loyalists angry at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’sattempt to scuttle President Obama’s pending nuclear deal with Iran. And as John Judis observed, part of it is rooted in political shifts in Israel and the U.S. and resultant changes in lobbying efforts and gamesmanship on both sides. But that still doesn’t fully explain why so many Democrats would risk a backlash from Jewish voters and supporters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic. The answer lies not with the politics of Jewish Americans, but those of Christians. [WaPo: “In November 1945, [President Harry Truman] offered this riposte to American diplomats cautioning him against embracing the cause of Zionism: ‘I’m sorry, gentlemen, but I have to answer to hundreds of thousands who are anxious for the success of Zionism: I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs among my constituents.’”] Sort it out - As Christians have migrated in increasing numbers to the Republican Party and non-believers have aligned themselves mostly with Democrats, the political pressure points have changed. Social issues, particularly Democratic support for access to elective abortions, have been a major part of this sorting. And like other trends in partisanship, it has been self-perpetuating and self-intensifying. As Christians became more Republican, the Republican Party increasingly reflected their values. Those values, especially among the growing number of evangelical Protestants, include a belief that their faith is an outgrowth of Judaism and in the promise of a land set apart for the people to whom their God first chose to reveal himself. As Democrats become less Christian and Republicans become more Christian, expect the partisan prism on Israel so astonishingly displayed today to become commonplace. [In the latest Gallup poll, 45 percent of Americans view the Israeli leader favorably, up 10 points since 2012 and tying the highest rating recorded by Gallup over Netanyahu’s tenures.] “America’s bond with Israel is stronger than the politics of the moment…This is an important message at an important time and the Prime Minister is the perfect person to deliver it.” –Speaker John Boehner says in a new video previewing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress. Bulldog - WashEx: “…Boehner …. said he will give Israel's leader a bust of [Winston Churchill] to note that only those two foreign leaders have ever addressed Congress three times.” [The Boston Globe reports that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will be among those giving Netanyahu the cold shoulder.] HOUSE MAY VOTE ON DEMS’ HOMELAND BILL TODAY National Journal: “House GOP leaders plan to allow a vote as early as [today] on a clean bill to fund the Homeland Security Department through the rest of the fiscal year, according to Republican sources, dashing the hopes of conservatives who want to tie the money to language clocking President Obama’s executive actions on immigration. Leaders detailed their plan at a closed-door GOP conference meeting [this morning]…According to a source in the room, Speaker John Boehner told members the House would vote on the Senate’s DHS funding bill once it receives papers confirming that the other chamber would not go to conference on the bill…. ‘[T]he House has done its job by passing legislation to fund DHS and block the president’s executive actions on immigration,’ Boehner said, according to the source. ‘Unfortunately, the fight was never won in the other chamber.” “I am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president. … I believe this decision – considering where we are – is the right one for this team, and the right one for this country. The good news is that the president’s executive action has been stopped, for now. This matter will continue to be litigated in the courts, where we have our best chance of winning this fight.” –Speaker John Boehner at a House GOP conference this morning. RYAN & CO. LOOK TO REASSURE JUSTICES ON OBAMACARE Paul Ryan, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, along with Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. and Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., add another layer to the GOP plan to cover ObamaCare beneficiaries if Supreme Court justices opt to blow up the law. The budget hawks proposal comes in a WSJ op-ed and meshes with other proposals floated by Senate Republicans in recent days. [Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream previews the ObamaCare Supreme Court arguments set for Wednesday and the media campaign around Chief Justice John Roberts.] CROSSROADS KEEPS HITTING HASSAN NHjournal: “Following up its radio ad buy announced last week, the conservative issues group Crossroads GPS [today] will launch a $50,000 digital ad buy again criticizing Gov. Maggie Hassan [D-N.H.,] for a proposed budget it says includes ‘more spending, higher taxes, and no real innovation.’ Crossroads last week became the second out-of-state group to attack Hassan, who is viewed as a possible contender for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Kelly Ayotte, [R-N.H.]…. The new digital ad will be seen on Facebook, Twitter and search engine web sites, Crossroads said. Its script is similar to the radio ad, charging Hassan proposed a tax that ‘would hit lower income people hardest’ and ‘sizeable increases in business taxes.’” #JOBHUNT From Politico’s interview with departing White House communications boss Dan Pfeiffer: “[O]ne of the coolest things out there right now ... is what Snapchat is doing with ESPN, CNN, Vice and some others through their Discover function.” HEAVY DUTY ROBBERY From the bizarre crime files, WFTX reports that the Collier County Sheriff’s department is trying to solve a hefty theft in Monterey, a gated community in North Naples, Fla. The thief somehow made off with 183 boxes filled with rolled nickels worth over $18,000 from a house party on February 15. At almost a half-pound per $2 roll, that would be nearly two tons of 5-cent pieces. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “Nobody is asking for America to go to war. What the Israelis are asking, what a lot of Americans are asking – including the majority of Republicans – is real sanctions and to give the Israelis the green light to defend themselves. They have never asked for Americans to go to war on their behalf and they are not asking that today.”—Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

"Instead, Hillaryland “has left the task of defending the former secretary of state — and her family — to a small corps of well-regarded, loyal and badly overstretched aides who have been forced to deal with an avalanche of requests about the foundation, starting with reports that officials solicited millions in donations from foreign governments. Clinton’s personal spokesman Nick Merrill, for example, declined to comment for this story.”","123","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillarys-private-email-fiasco-why-remains-huge-media-target.html"
"Merrill works hard at fielding inquiries, but his response to the last two controversies has been thin, presumably because he hasn’t been given much to work with. His comment that Hillary had complied with “the letter and spirit of the rules” didn’t do much to blunt the email revelation.","124","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillarys-private-email-fiasco-why-remains-huge-media-target.html"

"But the media’s insistence that Hillary must plunge into the race immediately if not sooner is about their agenda, not hers. The pundits want more access to Hillary, more campaign officials to deal with. They want her in the daily fray because that makes for better copy.

"On the other side, the sooner that Hillary becomes an official candidate, the sooner she gets pummeled even more and is expected to respond to every hostile criticism and tweet. And, after a quarter century in the public spotlight, the sooner that the public becomes tired of her.","128","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillarys-private-email-fiasco-why-remains-huge-media-target.html"

"ONE EMAIL FROM OBLIVION: HILLARY’S BIG BET ON SECRET SERVER With the revelation that presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “wiped clean” any trace of tens of thousands of emails from her time as secretary of state, the 2016 presidential campaign enters a new phase. With a move as audacious as any in the evidence destruction game, Clinton has set her candidacy dangling. Clinton told reporters that the more than 30,000 emails she ordered deleted would have exonerated her, but she destroyed them in the interest of her and her family’s privacy. By her reasoning, there is nothing related to emails with foreign powers who donated money to her family foundation. No directions to staffers about dealing with political controversies. No emails to her political network and friends about government business. Nothing official or of a foreign-policy nature. At all. Just yoga lessons and bridal bouquets. And if that’s the case, she has nothing to worry about. [Fox News: “Senate Republicans are renewing efforts to learn why Huma Abedin, a top assistant to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was allowed to keep working at the agency under a special, part-time status while also being employed at a politically-connected consulting firm.] But if there are things that Clinton wants to keep from congressional investigators, she had better hope that her deletion crew bleached every corner of the digital world. Because if even a pixel of something Clinton should have handed over is unearthed in her domain or in a musty folder in someone else’s email system, Clinton would be a political goner. Her bold move to destroy emails even after being asked for them by the government would leave her in major-league trouble in the middle of her second presidential run. And Clinton has placed herself in the digital shark cage. If there’s anything amiss, she’d better hope that her IT guys are the very best on the business. [A ‘reset,’ you might even say - NYT: “[Clinton] told a representative of a group of prominent Jewish leaders on Sunday that she wanted to put the relationship between the United States and Israel back on ‘constructive footing,’ the representative said.”] 2016 DEMOCRATIC POWER INDEX: O’MALLEY SHOWS MUSCLE Presidency ‘not a crown’ - WaPo: Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley took a swipe at likely 2016 contenders Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush on Sunday, saying that ‘the presidency of the United States is not some crown to be passed between two families.’ Appearing on ABC’s ‘This Week,’ O’Malley, who is weighing a possible run against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, called the presidency ‘an awesome and sacred trust to be earned and exercised on behalf of the American people.’ O’Malley — who at times has been reluctant to take on Clinton directly — declined to say whether he thought the former secretary of state would stand up to Wall Street and other special interests. ‘I don’t know where she stands,’ he told host George Stephanopoulos. ‘Will she represent a break with the failed policies of the past? Well, I don’t know.’” “I think that our country always benefits from new leadership and new perspectives.” –Former Gov. Martin O’Malley, D-Md., on ABC’s “This Week” 2016 Democratic Power Index - 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Martin O’Malley [+2]; 3) Joe Biden [-1]; 4) Elizabeth Warren [-1]; 5) Jim Webb [Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins “The Real Story” in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who’s up and who’s down in the 2016 Power Index.] 2016 GOP POWER INDEX: KASICH, HUCKABEE GET IN POSITION 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Scott Walker; 3) Ted Cruz; 4) Marco Rubio; 5) Rand Paul; 6) John Kasich [+2]; 6) Carly Fiorina [-1]; 8) Rick Perry [-1]; 9) Mike Huckabee [+2]; 10) Chris Christie [-1] On eve of Schiavo anniversary, Jeb takes light touch on defining moment - WSJ: “Casting himself as the “most conservative governor in Florida’s history,” Jeb Bush ticks off a record in office that includes tax cuts, vetoes on spending, private-school vouchers and fewer state employees. But the likely 2016 presidential candidate rarely, if ever, trumpets one of his most enduring conservative credentials: his yearslong effort to save Terri Schiavo, a severely brain-damaged woman whose husband wanted to remove life support despite her parents’ objections. Mr. Bush isn’t planning to attend a charity fundraiser, hosted by her family, on Tuesday marking the 10th anniversary of Ms. Schiavo’s death.” [Bush begins his West Coast swing today with a $25,000-per-couple reception and discussion at The Pacific Club.]","140","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/30/one-email-from-oblivion-hillarys-big-bet-on-secret-server.html"
"Meet Tonette Walker - The Hill: “A Scott Walker presidential campaign may end up being one of the easier things Tonette Walker has had to endure. The Wisconsin first lady has experienced poverty, becoming a young widow and losing other close family members, the lonely period of cynicism and despair that followed, a whirlwind romance to the much younger future governor, and death threats from a nasty labor fight. Those that know the Walker family describe Tonette as ‘tournament-tested’ and ‘unflappable,’ and say the political and personal travails she has faced will leave her well-equipped to deal with the rigors of national campaign and the next-level close-up she’ll get. ‘She’s been through a lot,’ said Wisconsin GOP lobbyist Brandon Scholz. ‘His campaigns have never been easy, and they’ve been through campaign after campaign after campaign. She’s ready.’ Walker allies say Tonette is more than just a figurehead, she’s a member of her husband’s inner political circle…” Cruz lifts off, but limits emerge - Bloomberg: “Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush continues to lead the pack of Republican presidential hopefuls, but one candidate is making moves. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the only GOP hopeful to formally announced his candidacy thus far, has shot up in the rankings in a new CBS News poll. Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed said that they would consider voting for Cruz in March, up 14 points from when the same question was asked a month ago. By comparison, 51 percent said they would vote for Bush, just two percent higher than did in February. Still, while Cruz is enjoyed a one-month bump, the conservative Texan continues show serious weakness among Republican voters. Twenty-two percent of those surveyed said they could not vote for Cruz, one point higher than in February's poll. Twenty-seven percent of those polled said they would not vote for Bush in March, while 26 percent said the same in February.” “In the presidential race in 2016, there may be other candidates who choose to throw rocks my direction. I’m not going to engage in the personal mudslinging, in the negative attacks on people's character.” –Presidential Candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on CNN’s “State of the Union” Save the date: Rubio ready for Miami kick off - Miami Herald: Marco Rubio has reserved the Freedom Tower in downtown Miami for an undisclosed event April 13, which appears to be a potential, if not likely, spot for Florida’s junior senator to announce his candidacy for president. A Rubio adviser stressed nothing has been nailed down for any kind of announcement, but the timing makes sense: Likely presidential candidate Rand Paul is expected to make things official April 7, followed by a five-day, five-state announcement tour, so Rubio presumably would not want to share the spotlight during that period.” [Watch Fox: Rubio will appear today on “The Five” in the 5 p.m. ET hour.] Can Rand lead a GOP youth surge? - National Journal: “When Sen. Rand Paul makes his first visit to Iowa as an official presidential candidate next month, he will head to the campus of the University of Iowa. The location, one of the state's biggest liberal strongholds, seems unusual for a Republican, but Paul is headed there in the hopes of appealing to a different constituency. As Paul prepares to formally enter the 2016 arena, younger conservatives are emerging as a backbone of his campaign strategy: a source not only of volunteers and energy but votes. A youth-fueled campaign, his team hopes, will also help brand him as a fresh face for the future of the Republican Party. From campaigning at universities (by the end of his coming trip, Paul will have hit both of the Iowa's biggest college towns already in 2015) to using Snapchat and doing interviews with MTV, Paul is focusing more on the next generation of Republicans than any of his GOP rivals.” Fiorina: Chances of a run ‘higher than 90 percent’ - Reuters: “Former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said on Sunday the chances she would run for the U.S. presidency in 2016 were ‘higher than 90 percent’ and that she would announce her plans in late April to early May. Fiorina, speaking on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ said she could not yet announce the bid because she was working to establish her team and put together what she described as ‘the right support’ and financial resources.” “Hillary Clinton lacks a track record of accomplishment. She is not candid, which suggests her character is flawed. And I think now in e-mail gate, we not only have a situation where she is clearly not being candid. I mean, her saying all those e-mails she erased were just her and Bill chatting is a little bit like Richard Nixon saying those erased moments on the tape were he and Pat talking.” –Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina on “Fox News Sunday” Watch here.

At a time when the United State Secret Service hasn’t been receiving much in the way good press, today provides a reminder of the conspicuous success of the agency charged with protecting the president. On this day in 1981, President Ronald Reagan, Press Secretary Jim Brady, a Secret Service agent and a D.C. police officer were shot by lone gunman John Hinckley Jr. at a Washington curbside, all would survive.

Mike Pence says legislation he signed last week is about “empowering people to confront government overreach” and “not about discrimination” as detractors claim. Recent furor in the mainstream media over the Religious Freedom Restoration Act may seem to hold peril for Pence, a potential 2016 contender, but in political terms standing up for individual rights against government intrusion is not a bad place for the Republican to be. “We’re not going to change the law,” Pence told ABC News, though he said he would look at a bill to clarify the law’s intent. The measure prohibits Indiana laws that “substantially burden” a person’s ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. [Fox News: “The definition of ‘person’ includes religious institutions, businesses and associations, which is being interpreted as allowing a cake maker, for example, to legally refuse an order for a wedding cake for a gay couple.”] What’s really in a RFRA? - The Federalist’s Gabriel Malor observes: “This law, known as a Religious Freedom Restoration Act or RFRA (pronounced ‘riff-ra’), tracks the language of the 1993 federal RFRA signed into law by President Clinton after a 97-3 vote in the Senate. But you would not necessarily know how innocuous it is from news media coverage. According to what you might hear in the news, this is an anti-gay law that is ‘almost universally loathed,’ and which a White House official suggested would ‘legitimize discrimination.’ Indiana’s RFRA has none of these characteristics.” “There’s a lot of people across this country who, you're looking at ObamaCare and the Hobby Lobby decision, looking at other cases, who feel that their religious liberty is being infringed upon and, and The Religious Freedom Restoration Act at the federal level and all the states now, including Indiana, who have it, are simply about addressing that. This is not about discrimination.” – Gov. Mike Pence, R-Ind., on ABC’s “This Week” [Hill’s ‘sad’ week-ender - “Sad this new Indiana law can happen in America today. We shouldn’t discriminate against ppl bc of who they love” –Hillary Clinton tweet Friday.] Back at you - Time looks at how controversy over Indiana’s law could ensnare leading Democrats like President Obama, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New York Senator Chuck Schumer, who previously supported bills with similar effects years ago.

With 38 days to go until the election, the Conservatives would offer strong leadership and a country that was safe and secure but Mr Miliband would offer a country mired in ‘economic chaos’” ‘I JUST DECIDED IT WOULD LOOK BETTER WITHOUT THE WEENIE’ AP: “The small southern Utah town of Hurricane might become a little quieter after a statue of a copper bull lost its most prominent private feature this weekend. The sculpture holds a high perch above the sign for Barista's restaurant, and owner Stephen Ward said he woke up Friday and decided the bull would look better without the oversized genitalia that caused uproar among the neighbors. Hurricane residents disturbed by the noticeable, cone-shaped feature had asked the city council to revoke Barista's business license. … ‘I told them I am not removing the penis for you or because of your complaints. I don't like you. I'm doing it for me,’ Ward said. ‘I just decided it would look better without the weenie. And oh my God! It's beautiful.’” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"NO ONE READ HILLARY EMAILS BEFORE DESTRUCTION How did Hillary Clinton know that the tens of thousands of emails from her time in office she ordered destroyed were personal? Did she or even her staff scroll through her sent items scanning emails about “yoga routines” or “family vacations” before deleting them? Nope. No one looked at them. The Clinton campaign said those emails that did not crop up in a keyword search performed by her team were automatically deleted. No eyes. No one to be subpoenaed. Just highlight all and press delete. That method seems better for missing emails than to finding them. And it would sound reckless and haphazard coming from another politician. In this case, though it sounds like a woman covering her tracks in preparation for a long and bloody legal fight over subpoenas to come. [AP: “The Associated Press on Wednesday sued the State Department to force the release of email correspondence and government documents from Hillary Rodham Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state.] See ya - Time: “For more than a year after she left office in 2013, she did not transfer work-related email from her private account to the State Department. She commissioned a review of the 62,320 messages in her account only after the department–spurred by the congressional investigation–asked her to do so. And this review did not involve opening and reading each email; instead, Clinton’s lawyers created a list of names and keywords related to her work and searched for those. Slightly more than half the total cache–31,830 emails–did not contain any of the search terms, according to Clinton’s staff, so they were deemed to be ‘private, personal records.’” Gowdy tries to broker a deal to see server - AP: “The chairman of a House committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi said Wednesday he wants an independent review of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s email server that she insists should remain private, setting up a confrontation between the GOP-led Congress and the likely presidential candidate. House Speaker John Boehner’s office did not rule out a vote in the full House to force Clinton to turn over the server. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., told The Associated Press that neither Clinton nor the committee should determine which emails are made public and which remain private. ‘Let a neutral, detached, disinterested observer make that call,’ he said, suggesting a retired judge or inspector general could fill the role.” Report finds poor electronic hygiene at State Department - WaPo: “In perhaps the mostly timely inspector general report of all time, the State Department’s watchdog released its review of the agency’s e-mail record keeping Wednesday, highlighting specific lapses and confusion. The IG concluded that there’s no ‘central oversight’ of recording e-mails at State. And that ‘many e-mails that qualify as records are not being saved as record e-mails.’ The IG conducted its review last year of a program lower-level State employees use for archiving their e-mails.” [The Obama administration’s plan for Internet regulations, long held in secret, is expected to be released today.] DID HILLARY SIGN ON THE LINE? WashEx: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, like all departing federal employees, was required to fill out and sign a separation statement affirming that she had turned over all classified and other government documents, including all emails dealing with official business. Fox News’ Megyn Kelly reported Wednesday evening on the requirement and that a spokesman for Clinton had not responded to a request for comment, including an explanation of when the former chief U.S. diplomat signed the mandatory separation agreement or, if she didn't, why didn't she. The Washington Examiner also asked Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill for comment late Wednesday but had received no response from him early Thursday.” “Every employee at the State Department has to sign this little piece of paper when they leave the State Department. And it says I certify basically under penalty of perjury that I have returned all official records that were in my possession while I was an officer of the Department of State. So where is that document, Megyn? And if there isn't, if [Hillary Clinton] didn't sign that, why not? There are a lot of questions to be answered.” --Former DOJ Attorney Shannen Coffin on “The Kelly File” Watch here. The Judge’s Ruling: Hillary broke her oath - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst JudgeAndrew Napolitano says Hillary Clinton violated her duty to safeguard classified records when she used a personal email account as Secretary of State and asks: “Mr. President, will your Department of Justice prosecute Clinton for retaining 48 months of classified records on her personal server after she left office, as it did Gen. David Petraeus, who kept 15 months of classified records in a desk drawer in his home after he left office?” BALZ: HILLARY NEEDS AN OPPONENT Dan Balz writes: “For Democrats, institutionally and collectively, the stakes are high. Victory in the 2016 general election is far from certain, whatever the demographic trends. Those who claimed they wanted a competitive nomination contest, even if they didn’t really want it or assumed it would not happen, must think now that it would be more valuable than ever. That still looks unlikely, but without it, [Hillary Clinton] will be running mostly against herself for the next year and some months, and as the past week has shown, that’s not always in her best interest.” Warren setting trap for Hillary on trade - The Hill: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is locking horns with the Obama administration over possible provisions in forthcoming trade proposals that she says could help multinational corporations at the expense of American workers. The administration hit back just minutes after Warren signed off a conference call with reporters, releasing information meant to show that President Obama's proposal would increase transparency and protect workers' rights.” O’Malley won’t engage on scandal - WaPo: “The one person in politics who seems most reluctant to talk about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s e-mail is someone who stands to benefit from the continued controversy: her potential Democratic presidential primary rival, Martin O’Malley. On Wednesday, the former Maryland governor declared he was “a little sick of the e-mail drama,” after being asked about it multiple times by reporters covering a speech he gave at the Brookings Institution in Washington. … O’Malley was also asked Wednesday if he would release his e-mail from his days as governor. … It didn’t sound like much would be forthcoming from O’Malley. He relayed that Maryland has no requirement for governors to keep copies of e-mail and that his office generally deleted them after “a set number of weeks,” unless the e-mail in question was part of litigation or a public information act request.” “Most years, there’s the inevitable frontrunner. And that inevitable front-runner is inevitable right up until he or she is no longer inevitable.” – Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley on MSNBC. Dead. Broke. - Politico: “By Election Day 2016, taxpayers will have paid out more than $16 million to fund Bill Clinton’s pension, travel, office expenses and even the salaries and benefits of staff at his family’s foundation, federal records show. Since he left the White House in 2001, Clinton and his office have received more money through the Former Presidents Act than any other ex-president, according to a POLITICO analysis of budget documents.” KERRY CONCEDES IRAN NUKE DEAL WOULDN’T BE BINDING WashEx: “The Obama administration won’t submit any deal limiting Iran’s nuclear ambitions to Congress for approval because it won’t be legally binding, Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday. ‘We’ve been clear from the beginning we’re not negotiating a legally binding plan. We’re negotiating a plan that will have a capacity for enforcement,’ he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ‘We don’t even have diplomatic relations with Iran right now.’ Kerry, who was visibly irritated by what he called misconceptions by lawmakers about the ongoing talks, was criticizing an open letter to Iran’s leaders signed by 47 Republican senators. The letter has angered Democrats, but appears not to have slowed bipartisan efforts to force congressional approval of a deal, in spite of stiff opposition by the Obama administration. As he spoke, committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who did not sign the letter but is a sponsor of legislation to require approval of any deal, cut him off. Corker later noted that as a senator, Kerry had demanded congressional approval of a proposed agreement with Iraq on the status of U.S. troops there.” Rubio roasts - Miami Herald: “U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio had a pointed exchange Wednesday with Secretary of State John Kerry in a Senate hearing … in which Rubio's first question to Kerry was this: ‘I believe that much of our strategy with regards to ISIS is being driven by a desire not to upset Iran so that they don't walk away from the negotiating table on the deal that you're working on,’ he said.” Cotton trolls so hard - In a too-transparent effort to shift the discussion away from her ongoing troubles, Hillary offered her first-ever explicitly partisan attack on Twitter concerning the open letter from 47 Republican Senators reminding Iran’s theocracy that any deal President Obama makes without congressional approval will not be binding for subsequent administrations. So Republicans took to Twitter to roast Clinton for supporting the president’s unpopular policy on Iran. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... It is ground cumin that makes your chili taste like chili and that signifies Mexican cuisine to American palates. Now, the musky, pungent flavor from the seeds of the tall, flowering cumin plant is making it into an increasing number of dishes here. But did you know that cumin is one of the most common flavors across the world and carries with it a remarkable etymological history and can helps us trace the growth of trade and agriculture across the millennia? Spicy, indeed. NPR takes us through the funky history of cumin: “In English, at least, cumin has a singular distinction – it is the only word that can be traced directly back to Sumerian, the first written language. So when we talk about cumin, we are harkening back to the Sumerian word gamun, first written in the cuneiform script more than 4,000 years ago.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 44.8 percent//Disapprove – 50.8 percent Direction of Country: Right Direction – 32.3 percent//Wrong Track – 59.7 percent NEW HAMPSHIRE IS THE PLACE TO BE Jeb Bush and Scott Walker hit New Hampshire Friday to begin a battle for the hearts and minds of Granite State party leaders and activists. The top tier 2016 contenders and other Republican hopefuls are converging on the “first in the nation primary” state over the next several days for good reason. First, without a regional favorite as was the case in 2012, things look more inviting. And, an always-alluring prize has increased in value due to a tight 2016 primary calendar. Wining in New Hampshire, along with two or more of the early 2016 contest states, creates a February momentum that could enable a candidate to lock up the nomination in March. And with Super Tuesday perhaps to become Super-duper Tuesday as conservative Southern states look to be first in line, New Hampshire is the best place to be right now. Early rounds - New Hampshire should be fertile Bush territory, though this is Jeb’s first trip there in 15 years. Walker visited once in 2012. Both men will be looking to make good first impressions with party officials in the retail politics state. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry has events in N.H. today and Friday, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hits the state Sunday and Monday. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, with a natural appeal in the “Live Free” state, is not instate this weekend. However, like most other GOP hopefuls, Rand has made several forays to New Hampshire this cycle. Walker to meet Granite State heavyweights - New Hampshire Union Leader: “Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will have private meetings with former Gov. John H. Sununu, state Senate President Chuck Morse and Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas… His meetings and stops at this time are private, with the exception of his remarks Saturday to a New Hampshire Republican Party grassroots training conference at Concord High School.”] Jeb grabs key Ayotte aide - Boston Globe: “Former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s leadership PAC has hired two of the most sought-after New Hampshire Republican operatives to aid his efforts ahead of what could be a run for president. Rob Varsalone, a close confidant of US Senator Kelly Ayotte, and Nate Lamb, Scott Brown’s field director on his US Senate campaign last year, have been named senior advisers to Bush’s Right to Rise political action committee.” Perry PAC bolsters N.H. team - NH Journal: “[F]ormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s RickPAC has told the New Hampshire Journal it has made three key hires… Veteran political operative Michael Dennehy has moved into the role as RickPAC state senior advisor after having a similar role in Perry’s issues group, Americans for Economic Freedom…Dante Vitagliano has been named as field director of RickPAC in New Hampshire. He was deputy political director of Marilinda Garcia’s 2nd District U.S. House campaign last year, while Ryder Selmi will serve as North Country field manager.” Cruz to talk national security in S.C. - Prior to his two-day swing through New Hampshire, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas will address the South Carolina National Security Summit on Saturday in Columbia. Jeb to tap policy director from Wall Street - NRO: “Jeb Bush will in the coming days name Justin Muzinich the policy director of his likely 2016 presidential campaign, according to multiple sources. Muzinich, who holds an undergraduate degree and an MBA from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, has spent his career in finance, first at Morgan Stanley, where he worked in mergers and acquisitions, and then at the hedge fund EMS Capital. He currently serves as vice chairman of Muzinich & Co., the New York City investment firm.” [Cashing out - WaPo: “Bush is selling ownership stakes in Jeb Bush & Associates, a business consulting firm he launched after he left the governor’s office in 2007; and in Britton Hill Partnership, a business advisory group that in 2013 set up private-equity funds investing in energy and aviation.”] Walker wins crucial Chachi primary - WaPo:“Actor Scott Baio, who you may remember from either ‘Joanie Loves Chachi,’ or ‘Charles in Charge’ depending on when you graduated high school, recently rubbed whatever celebrity bling he has left onto presumed GOP presidential hopeful Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. On Tuesday, Walker was in Southern California running his not-yet campaign for president, took advantage of a photo op with Baio and his wife Renee Sloan. Baio, a registered Republican, then tweeted the photo with a pretty clear endorsement, ‘Gov. Walker sounds a lot like President Reagan. #WalkerForPres.’”] Poll: No strong feelings in Kentucky about Rand’s run - Lexington Herald-Leader: “According to the [latest Bluegrass poll,] 19 percent said [Rand Paul] should run for president, 19 percent said he should run for his Senate seat, 23 percent said both, 30 percent said neither, and 9 percent said they were not sure. Given the poll's plus-or-minus margin of error of 2.3 percentage points, those numbers reflect little statistical change from October, when the Bluegrass Poll asked the same question.” CRIST FANS SENATE SPECULATION Orlando Sentinel: “Charlie Crist is considering another run for the U.S. Senate, in the 2016 race. ‘Well, I have been encouraged to,’ Crist said Wednesday when asked by phone about reports that he might run again. Crist, who is in New York, declined to elaborate. Crist, a former Republican governor of Florida, ran for the Senate in 2010 as an independent, losing handily to Republican Marco Rubio, but finishing ahead of Democrat Kendrick Meek. In 2013 he formally changed his party affiliation to Democrat and last year ran again for governor, losing to incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Scott in a close race. There is a chance that Rubio will not seek re-election. He has repeatedly said that if he decides to run for president, he would not seek re-election to the Senate.” WORK IT, DENNIS AP: “Once a wanton wiener dog, Dennis went on a diet and is now a happy shadow of his former self after losing more than 75 percent of his body weight. Less than two years ago, Dennis weighed in at a whopping 56 pounds - about the size of four or five miniature dachshunds, which is what he is. … A series of ‘before’ photos show Dennis resting on rolls of fat, his head seemingly too little for his blob of a body. He couldn’t take more than a few steps without being out of breath. Then Brooke Burton adopted him from a relative who had fed him White Castle burgers, pizza and other human food, and didn’t pay much attention to the dog’s burgeoning belly. Burton put him on diet of dry dog food, plus lots of walks and affection. Now the 6-year-old wiener dog is a svelte 12 pounds and happily chasing squirrels in the backyard, playing fetch and bossing around the other three rescue dogs that live with him.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “No one has asked [Hillary Clinton] yet whether in the criteria that her staff used before destroying the 30,000 emails they decided that the communications about the Clinton Foundation and the contributions of other governments was a private or public issue. I suspect it was all deleted. But we won’t know.” —Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here. Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"Chagoury, a Nigerian citizen of Lebanese descent, has donated millions to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, and has long ties to the family.

"But a veteran Republican media strategist in Washington, Mark Corallo, did.

"""I understand David Vitter's desire to score political points against Hillary Clinton. I was in the Clinton opposition business long before anyone had heard of Senator Vitter.

"Corallo, who served as Attorney General John Ashcroft's spokesman in the Bush Justice Department from 2002-2005, counts Chagoury as a close friend.

"At this point, Vitter is not offering proof that Chagoury, a Maronite Catholic, had advocated against the Boko Haram designation -- or even alleging it.

"Vitter also drew a connection between the two major controversies looming over Clinton's expected presidential bid: over Clinton Foundation donors, and her use of personal email while secretary of state.

"Kerry designated Boko Haram an FTO when he became secretary in 2013. By then, its ties to Al Qaeda-affiliated groups were clearly established. Since that time, the Islamic militant group -- which has been responsible for numerous civilian attacks, rapes and kidnappings in Nigeria, including of over 200 schoolgirls in April 2014 -- has sworn fealty to the Islamic State.","258","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/28/senators-questions-over-clinton-foundation-nigerian-donor-spark-gop-infighting.html"

"Chagoury is listed as giving between $1 million and $5 million on Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

An ambassador of St. Lucia to the Holy See, he has been received ""warmly"" by Pope Francis ""several times,"" said Corallo, and has donated millions to Catholic charities. According to Corallo, he was friends with Ronald Reagan and along with family members has given generously to Republican candidates, including the Republican Party and the George W. Bush Presidential Library, over the years. His friendship with Bill Clinton, said Corallo, was sparked by their shared interest in Africa.","261","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/28/senators-questions-over-clinton-foundation-nigerian-donor-spark-gop-infighting.html"
"Chagoury, who has a residence in Los Angeles, is not without controversy, however. He made his fortune building The Chagoury Group, described as an industrial conglomerate with interests in construction, real estate, property development, IT communications, finance and hotels. Both the Wall Street Journal and Harper's Magazine reported in 2008 that Chagoury has a ""controversial past,"" having supported and advised de facto president Sani Abacha, who seized power in Nigeria in a 1993 military coup. His reign was marked by human rights abuses and corruption. After the general died in 1998, Chagoury paid $300,000 to the new Nigerian government in exchange for immunity in a broader investigation of billions of dollars improperly taken out of the country during Abacha's tenure.","262","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/28/senators-questions-over-clinton-foundation-nigerian-donor-spark-gop-infighting.html"

"""There was tremendous pushback,"" Pham told FoxNews.com, recalling his own advocacy for the FTO on Capitol Hill as early as 2011.

"We must be getting close. The most recent revelation – that Hillary used an untraceable personal email account during her tenure as Secretary of State -- should be a tipping point.

"The Federal Records Act requires officials to keep records of all communications related to their position. They did not add electronic communications to the requirement until this year. This requirement will presumably enable investigations undertaken by watchdogs or the press, such as the Congressional inquiry into what went wrong in Benghazi. That Mrs. Clinton kept no such records – that her emails were not downloaded onto government servers for safekeeping and that she did not even have a government email account, is shocking. It is equally amazing that this dereliction – described as a “serious breach” by government record-keepers -- has gone unnoticed until now.

"Certainly Clinton has a lead in the Hawkeye State that at present looks insurmountable. But as former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley observed recently, he’s seen plenty of candidates who were inevitable right up until the point they were no longer inevitable.","334","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"

"That’s where Jim Webb comes in. He’s in the middle of his second trip to Iowa since announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory committee. On Sunday, he presided over one of those famous Iowa ‘living room’ events with a group of about 40 people that included many veterans. Unlike recent Clinton events, the session – at the home of Dick Goodson -- was a free-flowing question-and-answer session that the press was actually invited to attend.","336","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"The group, which included many potential caucus goers, was happy for the chance to hear another Democratic voice.","337","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"“The way you really get a good party and a good representation to run for president is by having contested races,” Goodson told Fox News. “That’s what the Republicans are doing. And I think it will serve them well.”","338","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"While no one asked Webb about it, the controversies swirling around Hillary Clinton were very much on the minds of these voters. Kristi Lund Lozier said she was “gung ho” for Hillary in 2008, but that it’s time to move on.","339","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"“I think she had her chance,” Lozier told Fox News. “I think she’s got a lot of issues that she needs to deal with. I don’t think she is a slam dunk, nor should she be a slam dunk.”","340","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"Such sentiments are music to the ears of Webb’s organization. They’re hoping doubts about Clinton will present an opening that Webb – with far less name recognition and cash than Hillary – could walk right through.","341","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"Webb himself is careful not to criticize Clinton. When asked by Fox News to comment on her troubles, Webb replied, “I’m just not putting it into the formula. I mean, those are things that they have the capability of responding to, and I’m sure they’ll have their answers. What we’re really trying to do is connect on the issues that we care about and we’ve been working on.”","342","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"Webb appeared to connect at the veterans event. “I think he could end up being a very viable alternative to Hillary,” said Jane Brimmer, though Brimmer still hasn’t written off Clinton. She told Fox News that a Clinton-Webb ticket “might be an interesting combination.”","343","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"Other voters were indeed looking for an alternative to Hillary. Jim Marren, a Vietnam veteran, says he’s had enough of hearing about Clinton controversies. “I think she kind of feels like she’s an elitist. She can get by with these things,” Marren told Fox News. “It doesn’t ring right to me. You know, it kind of makes me a little leery about how trustworthy is she gonna be as a president?”","344","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"Many progressives in the Democratic Party are eager to see a challenge mounted against Clinton. Sen. Elizabeth Warren – their favorite – has so far said she’s not interested. Could Webb be the one? He certainly holds some positions that are to the left of Hillary – economic fairness and an aversion to Wall Street among them. But he also has positions that are to the right of her on the Second Amendment and affirmative action. He’s been described as a ""hodgepodge"" of political positions, but Webb says he’s fine with that.","345","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"“The positions that I take aren’t because of some party platform. They’re thinking through the issues and trying to figure out what is fair and what is right,” Webb told Fox News.","346","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"Lynn Hicks, the opinion page editor for the Des Moines Register, thinks Webb could fit right into a sweet spot with Iowa voters looking for an antidote to ‘Clinton fatigue’.","347","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"“I think Hillary’s got some baggage,” Hicks told Fox News. “I think whether its emails or other things, I think people are asking questions about that.”","348","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"How could Webb possibly battle the financial juggernaut that Clinton is putting together? He admits that’s the biggest problem he faces. But as witnessed with the veterans event, Webb is willing to put in the shoe leather necessary to engage in the sort of retail politics that can make a little money go a long way. Don’t forget, in 2012, Rick Santorum beat a much-better funded Mitt Romney by basically living in Iowa for a year, visiting all 99 counties here at least once.","349","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"Webb is also targeting a demographic group that could prove elusive to Clinton – disaffected white working class Democrats who have gravitated to the Republican Party in recent presidential elections. His message of economic fairness is aimed at places like Clay County, Ky. – the poorest county in the nation which is 94 percent white.","350","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"“I’ve just been basically been saying – hey – if we’re going to have this message, let’s have it for everyone and the people who left the Democratic Party for various reasons – one of them being Ronald Reagan,” Webb told Fox News.","351","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"Is Webb a longshot? To be sure. But Iowa is one of those places where a candidate who is committed to voters can suddenly catch fire. It’s said caucus goers want to see a candidate in person at least four times before they’ll support him or her. If Webb pulls the trigger on a run, he plans to spend a lot of time in the Hawkeye State meeting as many people as he can.","352","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"
"“I’ve seen, you know, a good receptivity of people willing to listen,” Webb told Fox News. “And we’ll just see where that ends up.”","353","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/27/could-jim-webb-be-hillary-alternative.html"

"WAIT. WHAT? HILLARY CALLS FOR ‘RESTORING TRUST’ IN POLITICS Facing a scandal that threatens to capsize her quest to return to the White House, Hillary Clinton debuted her first major policy speech since the official launch of her current campaign. Clinton focused on a call to end “mass incarceration” in America and denounced racial injustice in the legal system, but her focus was on the question of “trust” saying “we must urgently rebuild the bonds of trust and respect among Americans. …Restoring trust in our politics, our press, our markets.” That’s a pretty tall order for a woman who is now widely distrusted by the American electorate and facing accusations that she and her husband raked in part of their massive fortune through payola from people doing business with her State Department. Remember the last time Clinton spoke in so public a setting in New York, she was explaining that she had destroyed 31,000 emails from her time in office. It’s quite a switch for Clinton to join President Obama and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., in anti-imprisonment crusade. Clinton has long heralded the tough-on-crime policies of her husband’s administration – laws credited with helping to end the bloody drug turf wars of the 1990s but blamed for a booming black prison population. Under the Clinton administration, federal prosecutors stepped up drug prosecutions and today, and today most federal inmates are behind bars for drug offenses. Facing pressure from her left and a skeptical black electorate, Clinton had no trouble making the reversal. Clinton swung hard on the subject and seemed to score – at least with reporters. One called her speech “truly remarkable” and another called it “compelling.” But how about the issue of moral authority? Clinton is no doubt right that Americans, and not just black Americans, have lost confidence in the basic institutions of the Republic. What is unclear is how a woman who has been at the core of the bipartisan establishment for decades and is embroiled in what is only the latest corruption scandal of her long career can credibly claim the mantle of change. The candidate who is famous for shady dealing and intense secrecy doesn’t sound like the one to make the pitch for reform. CLINTONS DIDN’T DISCLOSE DONATIONS TIED TO URANIUM DEAL FIGURE Bloomberg: “There are in fact 1,100 undisclosed donors to the Clinton Foundation, [Frank Giustra] says, most of them non-U.S. residents who donated to CGEP. ‘All of the money that was raised by CGEP flowed through to the Clinton Foundation—every penny—and went to the [charitable] initiatives we identified,’ he says. The reason this is a politically explosive revelation is because the Clinton Foundation promised to disclose its donors as a condition of Hillary Clinton becoming secretary of state. Shortly after Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, the Clinton Foundation signed a ‘memorandum of understanding’ with the Obama White House agreeing to reveal its contributors every year. The agreement stipulates that the “Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative” (as the charity was then known) is part of the Clinton Foundation and must follow ‘the same protocols.’ It hasn’t.” Bubba to take donors on nine-day Africa junket - WaPo: “A delegation of 20 major Clinton Foundation donors — many of whom have also supported Hillary Rodham Clinton’s political campaigns — will accompany former President Bill Clinton on a nine-day foundation trip to Africa that starts Wednesday. … The Africa trip would appear to provide a select group of big dollar contributors the unique opportunity to travel abroad with the former president, spending days in his company. The Africa trip had already come under fire because it will conclude with a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in Morocco, an event being partially funded by a company owned by the Moroccan government.” Obama’s Millennial clout doesn’t transfer to Hillary - In an early indication that Hillary Clinton will not be able to replicate the success President Obama had with millennial voters, a poll out today from Harvard’s Institute of Politics says that generic Democratic candidate leads a generic Republican candidate by 15 points among millennial voters. That sounds big until you compare it to history. President Obama carried voters ages 18 to 29 by 23 points in 2012, and an astonishing 34 points in 2008. The 2016 forecast looks much more like 2004 when then-Democratic nominee John Kerry beat then-President George W. Bush in the demographic by 9 points. O’MALLEY’S CRIME CRACKDOWN AS MAYOR DRAWS HEAT ON RIOT TOUR WaPo: “Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley was heckled on a packed street corner in West Baltimore Tuesday, after he cut short a trip to Europe to return to the city he led as mayor for seven years. O’Malley (D), who is preparing to launch a White House bid, waded into a crowd near the burned-out shell of a CVS pharmacy that was destroyed and looted Monday night. He was confronted by two men on motorcycles who shouted expletives and blamed the recent violence in the city on O’Malley’s tough-on-crime policies from 1999 to 2007. … In his travels to early nominating states, O’Malley has…trumpeted progress made during his tenure, including a steep drop in violent crime, which is attributed in part to a zero-tolerance approach that led to a sharp increase in arrests.” [Bird on a wire - NYT describes O’Malley’s walking tour of an angry Baltimore and his defense of his tough-on-crime policies in a city that long reigned as the murder capital of America.] Pow! - Kevin Williamson writes: “Black urban communities face institutional failure across the board every day. There are people who should be made to answer for that: What has Martin O’Malley to say for himself? What can Ed Rendell say for himself other than that he secured a great deal of investment for the richest square mile in Philadelphia? What has Nancy Pelosi done about the radical racial divide in San Francisco?” Enter Sand-man - Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will announce Thursday he’s challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, the National Journal reports: “[A] senior Sanders adviser confirmed…he’s made a decision on 2016—and that he’s going to go for it…[though] the latest polls show him in single digits…some more liberal Democrats hope that Sanders’ run could get Clinton talking about more [liberal] policies…”] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE The long, cold winter covered much of Lake Michigan with sheets of ice, but now that the ice has retreated the water is remarkably clear. (The cold held back seasonal algae blooms that make the water murky in warmer weather.) As a result, the many shipwrecks that dot the floor of the second largest of the Great Lakes are visible through the blue waters. NPR reports: “Photos from the flight out of the Coast Guard’s Traverse City, Mich., air station show a variety of ships resting on the lake bottom, including the James McBride, a 121-foot brig that sank in 1857. … ‘An estimated 6,000 vessels were lost on the Great Lakes with approximately 1,500 of these ships located in Michigan waters,’ according to the state Department of Environmental Quality, which calls the wrecks ‘irreplaceable records of our cultural history.’” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

With more than 1,000 Hispanic evangelical leaders expected, this is a big opportunity for Bush to keep making inroads with the socially conservative voters who could deliver the nomination for him, as they did for his older brother. In addition to talking about his personal history with Christianity, and family he’ll also need to address his stances on education and immigration. Bush has taken heavy criticism for his position on Common Core, which is widely detested by conservative Christians. Bush’s position on immigration, however, will be his calling card with the group today. [Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee also addresses the crowd at NHCLC today providing Bush the opportunity to align with the evangelical favorite.] Prominent evangelical minister likes Jeb - Although much disappointed with Republican leadership so far, Samuel Rodriguez says that he remains ‘hopeful’ about Bush’s candidacy. Read the full interview with Bloomberg here. Contra Cruz - WaPo looks at the way Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, an evangelical Hispanic himself, are making their appeals to Hispanic voters. Cruz answers questions from the head of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce at a Washington event today. Backs Puerto Rico statehood - Tampa Bay Times: “On Tuesday in Puerto Rico, Bush spoke in English and Spanish and talked about immigration. As the Washington Post reported, Bush ‘reiterated his support for Puerto Rican statehood and said that the next president should help make Puerto Rico a state if residents vote to do so.’” Jeb weak on establishment endorsements - FiveThirtyEight: “So far, Bush has won very few endorsements. No current Republican senators or governors have endorsed him, and only five members of the House of Representatives have done so, all from his home state of Florida. Fortunately for Bush, none of his rivals are doing much better.” How James Baker cost Jeb a donor whale - National Review: “The bad blood between Bush and [Sheldon Adelson] is relatively recent, and it deepened with the news that former secretary of state James Baker, a member of Bush’s foreign-policy advisory team, was set to address J Street, a left-wing pro-Israel organization…Adelson sent word to Bush’s camp in Miami: Bush, he said, should tell Baker to cancel the speech. When Bush refused, a source describes Adelson as ‘rips***’; another says Adelson sent word that the move cost the Florida governor ‘a lot of money.’” RUBIO ISRAEL AMENDMENT COULD KILL IRAN DEAL Time: “Sen.Marco Rubio has proposed a change to the Iran nuclear review bill that could unravel a carefully crafted compromise and kill the Obama Administration’s negotiations. At issue is a one-page amendment from the Florida Republican and 2016 presidential candidate that would certify as part of the deal that Iran’s leaders have publicly accepted Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state, a proposal earlier pushed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier this month, President Obama rejected that idea...Many Republicans support the idea, however, while some influential Democrats, such as New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, have declined to comment on any amendments.” NO PRESS FOR WALKER’S ISRAEL TOUR BuzzFeed:“Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker isn’t inviting reporters to come along with him on his first political trip to Israel next month, a spokesperson said. ‘Gov. Walker’s trip to Israel will be a listening tour,’ said AshLee Strong, a spokesperson for Walker’s PAC, Our American Revival, last week. ‘It’ll happen mid-May and we won’t be having any press join.’” Governors have a rougher run - Noted smart person Josh Kraushaar explains why the conventional wisdom about governors being better positioned for presidential runs than senators is probably bunkum (especially in the era of social media and the nationalization of local controversies). CHANGING FORTUNES FOR RAND IN NEVADA David Drucker surveys the changing landscape in libertarian-leaning Nevada: “Some Paul supporters worry that a move by Nevada Republican leaders to replace the 2016 caucuses with a standard primary election could diminish the Kentucky senator’s prospects. Some Paul backers view this as the party’s way of diminishing Paul’s viability, an accusation GOP officials say is categorically false. A primary would attract a broader array of rank-and-file Republicans. Caucuses, where people meet publicly in small groups, tend to attract fewer, more committed voters.” SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX “The index showing Bush in the lead has a large flaw. He is so well known and attracts polling and money from a crowd that has already made up its mind, that we have to question whether any amount of money can get him more voters on a primary level.” – Richard Nelson “The two ‘gainers’ this week in the Fox Power Index were Marco Rubio (now #2) and Carly Fiorina (now #6). Both are proving standouts ‘on the stump’. For the GOP to win in 2016, the ticket will require very smart, articulate and aggressive candidates--Rubio and Fiorina are showing the way.” – Jim Hartman “It’s too early to be sure, but I'm thinking now that the dream ticket for the Republicans would be Rubio/Fiorina. They’re both strong on the issues, and they each bring tremendous additional strengths.” – Danny Bass SHE’S A LOWRIDER The Guardian: “A tortoise in Pembroke, west Wales, who faced a grim future after it was attacked by a rat during hibernation, has been given a new lease of life by its owners. They have aided their pet, named Mrs T, with wheels taken from a model aircraft to help with its mobility. The wheels are glued onto a frame that fits around Mrs T’s shell.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “…[T]here are two issues in the inner cities. One is single parenthood and the other is the worst schools on earth. Of the first, we have no idea how to solve that, of the second, we do. If you can’t improve the schools, give the kids a choice to go to better schools. The parents begged to have that opportunity but the teachers unions won’t allow it and thus the Democrats won’t. ” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"STATE DEPARTMENT STONEWALL STILL STANDING ON HILLARY DOC Did Hillary Clinton sign a form upon leaving the State Department that said she had handed over all work-related documents before departing? This would seem to be an easy question to answer. Check the drawer for form 0F 109 and if Clinton signed, hers should be the first one in the drawer. But the Democratic frontrunner wouldn’t say when Fox News tracked her to a campaign event Monday. And her former agency has gone nearly a week without responding to a Freedom of Information Act request. Saying that she did sign would be bad news because it would mean that she maintained her trove of government emails despite swearing that she had given everything up. Saying she didn’t sign would be another embarrassing lapse in security and records management for an agency with big problems on the front. The third option – that Clinton signed but the form cannot be found – would simply add to the list of too-convenient deletions and omissions in this ongoing email scandal. Teacher union chief: 'Yes,' I knew about Hillary’s private email - Weekly Standard: “Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, says that she knew about Hillary Clinton’s private email. Weingarten made the comment in Twitter, in response to a question from a Jeb Bush spokesman. Tim Miller, the Bush spokesman, tweeted, ‘@rweingarten also if not secret - did you know about the private email before the NYT story?’ Weingarten responded, ‘yes.’” [The latest CNN/ORC poll finds Americans split on Hillary’s email problems. 51 percent call the use of personal email as a very or somewhat serious problem while 48 percent don’t find much of a problem with it.] White House office to delete its FOIA regulations - USA Today: “The White House is removing a federal regulation that subjects its Office of Administration to the Freedom of Information Act, making official a policy under Presidents Bush and Obama to reject requests for records to that office. The White House said the cleanup of FOIA regulations is consistent with court rulings that hold that the office is not subject to the transparency law. The office handles, among other things, White House record-keeping duties like the archiving of e-mails. But the timing of the move raised eyebrows among transparency advocates, coming on National Freedom of Information Day and during a national debate over the preservation of Obama administration records. It's also Sunshine Week, an effort by news organizations and watchdog groups to highlight issues of government transparency.” Hillary looks to shut out challengers in early primaries - AP: “Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to run a primary campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination focused on the four traditional early-to-vote states, forgoing the chance to parlay her dominant position into an early start in the swing states key to the general election. Data-driven grassroots organizing in states such as Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, along with fundraising, will be the focus when Clinton launches her presidential campaign, probably in early April, according to people familiar with the strategy…” Hillary billed taxpayers $527,000 for charter flights as Senator - USA Today: “Before her 2006 Senate re-election campaign and 2008 presidential bid, then-senator Hillary Rodham Clinton dramatically increased her use of taxpayer-funded charter flights, becoming the Senate's biggest spender on reported charter airfare. … The figure rose to $527,000 when the cost of the staff who flew with her is included.” Foreign aid recipients among Clinton donors - NRO: “Algeria and the Dominican Republic, which both contributed to the Clinton Foundation, receive hundreds of millions of dollars yearly in foreign aid - including from the U.S. government…It took $8.6 million in assistance from the U.S. government the same year that it made the donation. And in 2011, a typical year for the North African country, it received $190 million in aid from foreign governments worldwide…The Dominican Republic gave a much larger donation to the Clinton Foundation, somewhere between $10 and $25 million in a grant to the organization’s HIV/AIDS program (the Foundation’s website does not provide exact grant numbers). The Caribbean nation received $35.5 million from the U.S. government in 2010, and the next year raked in $225 million from foreign governments around the world.” OBAMA TRADE PUSH A HEADACHE FOR HILLARY While President Obama has been taking heat from House Democrats over his request for expanded authority to make trade deals, Obama’s push has become a problem for Hillary Clinton. The 2016 Democratic frontrunner is under pressure from liberals to oppose her former boss’s push and are concerned about Clinton’s own complicated record on trade the Hill reports. “While some reports indicate Clinton backed [the North American Free Trade Agreement] internally during her husband’s years in the White House, she told a union audience in 2008 that she raised the ‘yellow caution flag’ against the pact….As Obama’s secretary of State, she supported a controversial Colombia trade agreement that organized labor vehemently opposed. She also voted in 2002 against giving President George W. Bush fast-track authority — the same authority Bill Clinton employed during the 1990s and that Obama is now requesting….‘Sen. Clinton has only not been a fan of the NAFTA-style trade agreements when it has been politically necessary to adopt fair trade rhetoric,’ said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, which opposes giving Obama fast-track.” Tariff-ically complicated - Bloomberg’s Mike Dorning takes a deep dive into the mystery of Hillary Clinton’s stance on free-trade and other issues that divide Democrats. JEB TESTS COMMON CORE MESSAGE ON FIRST S.C. SWING The (Charleston) Post and Courier: “COLUMBIA – Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s latest swing through South Carolina will begin Tuesday in Greenville to highlight business and education policy and end with a speech here to S.C. House Republicans. … Gov. Nikki Haley and Bush will hold a news conference around 3 p.m., following their visit to Sistercare, a Midlands organization that provides services to and support for domestic violence survivors and their children. … Bush plans to begin his day at the Upstate Chamber Coalition, a business group focused on public policy. Later, he’ll visit the Greenville area’s private Hidden Treasure Christian School in an event closed to the public. Bush’s visit to the school is expected to highlight a South Carolina education program that was based on a Florida initiative… Bush is known for championing school choice initiatives. But his continued support for the controversial Common Core education standards, which South Carolina did away with this year, may leave some Republicans on the fence.” WALKER LOOKS TO QUELL CONCERNS ABOUT ETHANOL FLIP Bloomberg: “Scott Walker continued to defend himself against suggestions that he’s flip-flopped on a key issue for Iowa, the state that will host the first presidential nomination voting in early 2016, as he spoke Monday evening with Tea Party activists nationwide. On a conference call organized by the Tea Party Patriots, the Wisconsin governor and likely Republican presidential candidate said he's been unwavering in his view that corn-based ethanol should eventually lose government protections and incentives…‘From our standpoint, our position is consistent,’ said Walker, who was first elected governor amid the 2010 Tea Party wave. ‘I talked about not wanting a mandate in Wisconsin as governor. We don’t have one. I do not support one.’…At a March 7 agricultural summit in Iowa, however, Walker said he supports the Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets the amount of renewable fuel that must be blended into gas sold in the U.S. At the time, he also called for the eventual elimination of government support for ethanol and other biofuels, as well as wind energy.” Snarky Twitter feed for new Walker hire Irks Iowans - Des Moines Register: “Iowa has been a punching bag in online quips by Republican Scott Walker’s new strategist for online communications. ‘In other news, I see Iowa is once again embarrassing itself, and the GOP, this morning. Thanks, guys,’ Republican political consultant Liz Mair tweeted in January this year, just after U.S. Rep. Steve King’s daylong multicontender Iowa Freedom Summit began.” MITT WARMS TO RUBIO WaPo: “Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has been cultivating a relationship with Mitt Romney and his intimates, landing some of the 2012 Republican nominee’s top advisers and donors and persistently courting others as he readies an expected 2016 presidential campaign. In a crowded field of contenders, the imprimatur of Romney could help clear Rubio’s path into the top tier. Since Romney announced in January that he would not run for the White House again, he and Rubio have had at least two lengthy phone calls in which Romney encouraged and mentored the 43-year-old Florida senator about the political landscape, according to a Romney associate. Rubio and Romney have built a warm and trusting rapport, in contrast to the frostiness that exists between Romney and the two current GOP front-runners, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker…In one-on-one meetings and communications with members of Romney’s inner circle, Rubio has impressed them with what they see as his compelling personal story, his depth and positions on policies, and his respect for Romney and his legacy in the Republican Party.” CHRISTIE TRIES TO BUCK UP BACKERS WSJ: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie gave donors to his political action committee a pep talk Monday and encouraged them to keep up their work in the face of a difficult stretch for his possible 2016 presidential bid. About 50 people attended the Monday breakfast in New Jersey for bundlers for the Republican governor’s PAC, Leadership Matters for America, according to those who went to the event. Attendees had to commit to raising between $25,000 and $100,000 by the end of March. An invitation for the event in Bernardsville, N.J., had capped the number of slots to 25 attendees, but was expanded to meet more demand. Attendees were a mix of those who have supported Mr. Christie since he first ran for governor in New Jersey in 2009, and newer faces, said John Lutz, one of the co-hosts.” SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER RANKINGS “Carly Fiorina is very smart, articulate and able to take the fight to Hillary Clinton--the traditional role of a good VP candidate. Paired with Marco Rubio for President, a Rubio-Fiorina ticket would have a generational and ethnic appeal as well.” – Jim Hartman “The GOP field is still to be determined, but my gut says either a Walker/Jindal or Walker/Fiorina or Walker/Martinez ticket would be the GOP's best bet.” – Frank Ancona “Democrats will end up with John Kerry as their Presidential nominee. GOP should end up with Scott Walker and Carly Fiorina on their ticket. Both could help us with business.” – Helen Jinks “If the Dems were smart they’d make sure that Webb and O’Malley were both in the race as backup in case the main street media does its job and REALLY starts digging in to The Hill’s issues!!” – Casey Levy WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... How Irish is America circa St. Patrick’s Day 2015? By one measure, even more Irish than Ireland. WaPo: “According to the Census, there are 34.5 million Americans who list their heritage as either primarily or partially Irish. That number is, incidentally, seven times larger than the population of Ireland itself (4.68 million). Irish is the second-most common ancestry among Americans, falling just behind German. New York has the most concentrated Irish population; 12.9 percent of its residents claim Irish ancestry, which compares to a rate of 11.1 percent of the country overall. Boston, meanwhile, claims the most-concentrated Irish population for a city: 20.4 percent. Trulia’s chief economist Jed Kulko put all this data on a map, which shows the heaviest concentration of Irish-American zip codes. He notes that ‘Irish-Americans are at least 5 percent of the population in most counties across the U.S., and 10 percent or more in most of New England, New York state, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and other smaller counties across the country.’” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The Associated Press, citing a senior U.S. official, reported that the letter, which was signed by 47 of 54 GOP members, first came up in negotiations on Sunday and was raised again Monday in discussions led by Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.” Bibi v. Buji - It’s Election Day in Israel. Turnout is high for the cliffhanger vote that might end up ousting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Haaretz has a nifty live blog to track turnout and the results. Polls close at 4 p.m. ET. HOUSE GOP PREVIEWS BALANCED BUDGET, OBAMACARE REPEAL WashEx: “House Republicans said they would aim to balance the budget and repeal Obamacare in a preview of their budget proposal released Monday. Tom Price, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, released a video of himself and other Republicans on the committee offering some hints of their plans Monday afternoon. Both House and Senate Republicans will introduce broad plans for taxes and spending this week ahead of an April 15 deadline for Congress to vote on a budget resolution. ‘First and foremost, our plan balances the budget,’ says Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind., in the video. Price and his Senate counterpart, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, have said that they will aim for a balanced budget in 10 years or earlier. Price is set to announce his proposal Tuesday morning, while Enzi announced Monday that the Senate Budget Committee will meet to draft its budget on Wednesday.” INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY IN SCHOCK SPENDING WaPo: “Ethics officials are examining the office of Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) following weeks of headlines about the manner in which he has spent from his taxpayer-funded account for official expenses. According to a source familiar with the review, the Office of Congressional Ethics is reviewing the collection of issues raised by reports that started with a $40,000 tab on decorating his Capitol Hill office in the manner of the PBS show ‘Downton Abbey’ and continued into personal finances and travel expenditures.” OREGON MOVES TO AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION Reuters: “Sweeping first-in-the nation legislation making voter registration automatic in Oregon was signed into law on Monday by Governor Kate Brown, potentially adding 300,000 new voters to state rolls. The so-called Motor Voter legislation will use state Department of Motor Vehicles data to automatically register eligible voters whose information is contained in the DMV system, with a 21-day opt-out period for those who wish to be taken off the registry…Under the state law, the Oregon Secretary of State will use the DMV data, which includes information on whether a person is a citizen, to register voters, who would then be sent a postcard with information on how to opt out of registration altogether.” RAPTOR RAPPED An Idaho woman’s overzealous sympathy for the hunted over the hunter may land her in jail, The Coeur d’Alene Press reports. In January, Patti McDonald allegedly meted out a dose of unnatural selection when she came upon Hornet, a falcon owned by hunter Scott Dinger. In his investigation of the incident which reportedly led to the bird of prey’s demise, Craig Walker, an Idaho Department of Fish and Game regional conservation officer said his office received a phone call from an unidentified woman who said she saw a falcon take a duck from the air and then went to the aid of the duck and tried to scare away the falcon. When the falcon remained in place holding the duck, the woman said she removed a scarf that had beads on it and beat the bird. “The woman later stated that she had been very upset about the duck being injured, but felt bad about injuring someone’s pet, because she “beat the crap out of it really hard,” the report states. If found guilty, McDonald could be sentenced to a maximum of six months in jail and $5,000 in fines.","365","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/17/state-department-stonewall-still-standing-on-hillary-doc.html"

"Clinton has been tweeting—although she’s shy about emailing—on all sorts of subjects. So, why, as the leading Democratic presidential possibility, has she not reached out to Netanyahu? Perhaps it’s to solidify her support from the Democratic Party, which has grown increasingly unsympathetic to Israel—influenced by President Obama and what The New York Times has called his “poisonous relationship” with Netanyahu.","371","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/20/israel-future-hillary-clinton-silence-on-netanyahu-win-speaks-volumes.html"

"The Republican Party and its presumptive presidential candidates stand squarely behind Netanyahu and his efforts to keep Israel safe.

"Clinton’s history with Netanyahu includes, as MSNBC.com pointed out that, “…longtime [Hillary] Clinton message guru Paul Begala went to Israel to help Netanyahu’s rival, and several strategists who worked for Barack Obama and could potentially join a Clinton campaign—led by field organizer Jeremy Bird—are working with a nonprofit that opposes Netanyahu.

"For starters, as Kelly asked Netanyahu, does Clinton believe that the Obama administration risks “conceding too much” to Iran in negotiations over Iran’s development of its nuclear bomb capability? How does Clinton think Israel and Netanyahu are supposed to deal with Iran’s repeated vows to annihilate the Jewish state? If she were president, what demands would Clinton make on the Iranians in the nuclear negotiations? What does she think of reports that President Obama would bypass Congress for approval of a deal with Iran and instead try to implement all or part of an agreement using a United Nations Security Council vote? What does Clinton make of threats by the Obama administration to—as Kelly put it—“abandon Israel at the United Nations” to force the creation of a Palestinian state? By Clinton’s assessment, how can Netanyahu and Israel consent to a Palestinian state when the Palestinians are allied with the terror group Hamas and when this combined entity is dedicated to the destruction of Israel?","377","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/20/israel-future-hillary-clinton-silence-on-netanyahu-win-speaks-volumes.html"

"WASHINGTON – The computer server that transmitted and received Hillary Clinton's emails -- on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was secretary of state -- traced back to an Internet service registered to her family's home in Chappaqua, New York, according to Internet records reviewed by The Associated Press.","Published March 04, 2015","381","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillary-clinton-email-server-traced-to-internet-service-registered-to-ny-home.html"
"The highly unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official physically running her own email would have given Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, impressive control over limiting access to her message archives. It also would distinguish Clinton's secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians, including Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc.","382","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillary-clinton-email-server-traced-to-internet-service-registered-to-ny-home.html"

"Operating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails.

"The Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton's email server.

"In November 2012, without explanation, Clinton's private email account was reconfigured to use Google's servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed, according to Internet records. That is significant because Clinton publicly supported Google's accusations in June 2011 that China's government had tried to break into the Google mail accounts of senior U.S. government officials. It was one of the first instances of a major American corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking.","391","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillary-clinton-email-server-traced-to-internet-service-registered-to-ny-home.html"
"Then, in July 2013, five months after she resigned as secretary of state, Clinton's private email server was reconfigured again to use a Denver-based commercial email provider, MX Logic, which is now owned by McAfee Inc., a top Internet security company.","392","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillary-clinton-email-server-traced-to-internet-service-registered-to-ny-home.html"
"The New York Times reported Monday that Clinton exclusively used a personal email account it did not specify to conduct State Department business. The disclosure raised questions about whether she took actions to preserve copies of her old work-related emails, as required by the Federal Records Act. A Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill, told the newspaper that Clinton complied with the letter and spirit of the law because her advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails to decide which ones to turn over to the State Department after the agency asked for them.","393","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillary-clinton-email-server-traced-to-internet-service-registered-to-ny-home.html"
"In theory but not in practice, Clinton's official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Since Clinton effectively retained control over emails in her private account even after she resigned in 2013, the government would have to negotiate with Clinton to turn over messages it can't already retrieve from the inboxes of federal employees she emailed.","394","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillary-clinton-email-server-traced-to-internet-service-registered-to-ny-home.html"
"The AP has waited more than a year under the open records law for the State Department to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat, although the agency has never suggested that it didn't possess all her emails.","395","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillary-clinton-email-server-traced-to-internet-service-registered-to-ny-home.html"

"Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the special House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, said the committee learned last summer -- when agency documents were turned over to the committee -- that Clinton had used a private email account while secretary of state. More recently the committee learned that she used private email accounts exclusively and had more than one, Gowdy said.","397","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/04/hillary-clinton-email-server-traced-to-internet-service-registered-to-ny-home.html"

"1. She used a private address so she didn’t have to carry two phones. But that excuse is belied by the fact that just last month she told an interviewer she owns “an iPad, a mini iPad, an iPhone and a Blackberry.”","403","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/11/hillary-clinton-private-emails-should-distrust-then-verify.html"
"2. She didn’t email anyone about any classified information and only exchanged emails with a single foreign official, someone from Britain she wouldn’t identify. But are we to take her statement at face value? This from the person who dodged numerous subpoenas for years during her years as first lady. An FBI report concluded that documents sought in the Whitewater investigation had been found in the personal White House quarters of the Clintons after going missing for two years. The first lady’s fingerprints were (literally) on them. As Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the former chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee notes:","404","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/11/hillary-clinton-private-emails-should-distrust-then-verify.html"

"3. She deleted all her personal emails before forwarding her correspondence to the State Department. Since her personal emails make up over half of the 60,000 or so she sent out, it’s important to determine just what was personal and what wasn’t. Clinton didn’t provide an answer.","406","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/11/hillary-clinton-private-emails-should-distrust-then-verify.html"
"Throughout the controversy about her emails, Hillary Clinton’s office has claimed they have responded “right away” to requests for them. But State Department officials tell a difference story, one in which their agency was asked to to comply with a request from a special House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi. That request came last October. It took lengthy negotiations and over two months before Secretary Clinton was forced to turn over some of her emails.","407","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/11/hillary-clinton-private-emails-should-distrust-then-verify.html"
"After reviewing which emails to send to State, Clinton said she deleted personal correspondence. ""I chose not to keep my private, personal emails -- emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends, as well as yoga routines, family vacations—the other things you typically find in In boxes. No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy.”","408","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/11/hillary-clinton-private-emails-should-distrust-then-verify.html"
"Of course, they do. But we have learned from Hillary Clinton’s role in Travelgate, Filegate, Whitewater, and numerous other scandals that she clearly blurs the lines between what is public information and what is private, constantly deciding against disclosure and transparency.","409","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/11/hillary-clinton-private-emails-should-distrust-then-verify.html"
"Back in 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray wrapped up his report on the White House Travel Office scandal, in which the office’s employees were summarily fired for political reasons and its director, Billy Dale, was indicted for fraud. A jury acquitted him within minutes of what was later generally acknowledged were trumped-up charges.

"OBAMA CONTROLS CLINTON’S FATE IN EMAIL SCANDAL Hillary Clinton said she wants “the public to see [her] email” in a tweet so Clintonian in its tortured language that it would have been perfect for a #throwbackthursday. The presumptive Democratic nominee most certainly does not want the public to see her “email,” which is why she built and maintained a secret server that risked massive security breaches but was designed to allow the eradication of any troublesome messages. That the server may have been overseen by a longtime aide with ties to the Clintons’ pardon scandal only makes the nostalgia more poignant. Pop in a Spin Doctors’ CD and let the 90s vibe flow, America. The former secretary of state is actually referring to emails she has already given the agency. Clinton’s campaign team would obviously have no qualms about releasing what has been already sterilized. But blaming the scandal on a bureaucratic snag beyond her control is an effort to inculpate the Obama administration. Team Obama, however, is fighting back. “That is why Doritos doesn’t get to decide which ingredients consumers need to know about, or why you don’t get to tell the cops which pocket to search.” – Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show.” Out on the ledge - AP reports today that the White House counsel’s office did not know Clinton was relying on private email servers and did so against the instructions she had been given. This comes after administration figures on Wednesday stepped gingerly away from the whole controversy, declaring their own electronic hygiene immaculate but leaving unanswered questions about Clinton’s potential misdeeds. It seems unlikely that Republican-led efforts to extract Clinton’s old emails will be fruitful. After all, if she is guilty of what her accusers allege, why would she suddenly get religion and cough up incriminating emails? What would be the point of breaking the rules and having a shady “homebrew” server if only to dump the data at the moment most damaging? But if the Obama administration were to decide to get serious, this could be the beginning of the end for Clinton’s second presidential campaign. Did someone say “special prosecutor?” “The bigger concern is was she transacting official government business that’s on a server that’s not secure? Because we know these servers are targets for foreign intelligence. We know the Chinese, the Russians, the North Koreans, the Cubans and others are constantly trying to hack into computers and especially that of government officials and if she was transacting sensitive State Department business on an insecure server, that alone is reason to be alarmed.” –Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on “The Kelly File” Dems anxious for alternative - WaPo: “Democratic activists in early presidential nominating states say that new controversies swirling around Hillary Rodham Clinton have made them more eager than ever for alternatives in 2016. The undercurrent of anxiety about Clinton’s vulnerabilities has grown in recent days with potentially damaging news of foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and the former secretary of state’s use of private email accounts to conduct official business.” [A new Quinnipiac Poll, taken before the controversy broke over Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email account as secretary of state, showed the Democratic frontrunner maintaining a 42 point lead over her closest competitor. Without Clinton in the race, Democratic voters polled give Vice President Joe Biden the lead at 35 percent, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 25 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 7 percent.] “There’s always another shoe to drop with Hillary… ‘I’ll tell you this: [Joe Biden] ain’t got no e-mail problems. He ain’t got no foundation problems. What you see with Joe is what you get. There’s nothing hidden there.’” -- Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina in an interview with WaPo. Heh - “Our Constitution is being shredded. We know about the secret wiretaps, we know about the secret military tribunals, the secret White House email accounts…It is a stunning record of secrecy and corruption, of cronyism run amok. It is everything our founders were afraid of, everything our Constitution was designed to prevent.” – Hillary Clinton in a 2007 jeremiad against the Bush administration. [Former Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., led a years-long effort against Karl Rove and others in the Bush administration over private emails. He sees things differently this time, though, telling Buzzfeed that while “he believed that she should turn all those records over there was a ‘distinction, though, between the presidency of the United States and other people in government.’”] Splatter paint - There has been a slew of reporting in the past three days on the electronic hygiene of Republican Sixteeners and the use of private email accounts. Rick Perry got some. Scott Walker too. While Jeb Bush got some sneers for having a private email server, his decision to preemptively dump his emails last month is looking wiser by the day as he seems to have broader latitude than any of his rivals to whack Clinton for her dubious digital conduct. Glass ceiling high, hard - Weekly Standard: “In late February, Hillary Clinton, a self-proclaimed champion of women’s rights and gender equity, came under fire for a Washington Free Beacon analysis that showed women on Mrs. Clinton’s staff during her tenure in the Senate were paid an average of 72 cents on the dollar compared to male staff. Now, an analysis of the latest IRS filing for the foundation that bears her name, the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, shows a similar compensation disparity between men and women employees. Although compensation figures are available for only a limited number of Foundation personnel, the 2013 Form 990 filed with the IRS shows that out of eleven highly compensated individuals listed, the top eight are all men.” LET’S PLAY HARDBALL Kathleen Matthews, chief global communications and public affairs officer for Marriot International and wife of MSNBC's Chris Matthews, is planning to run for the seat of Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Politico reports. Van Hollen announced Wednesday that he will vie for the seat being vacated by Maryland Sen.

"Pundits across the political spectrum have mocked the lack of a rationale for Clinton’s candidacy. Is she running for president because it’s “her turn,” because she’s the only Democrat with a truly national profile and near-universal name recognition, or because it’s the next logical thing to do in her political career? None of these are sufficient rationales for a candidacy, but in the absence of a cogent explanation from Clinton or her campaign, it’s natural for observers to make assumptions about why she’s seeking the highest office in the land.","434","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"

"A presidential candidate is generally expected to articulate policy priorities at a relatively early point in his or her candidacy. In Clinton’s case, the expectations should be even higher since she has been in public life for the better part of the last two decades.

"Vague statements about wanting to be a “champion” for “everyday Americans” don’t shed any real light on how she would grow our nation’s economy or improve our nation’s standing in the world. The lack of a policy agenda is particularly troubling given the fact that Clinton’s record on so many significant issues has been murky at best.","437","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"

"Very damaging, if last week’s revelations in the New York Times are representative of the activity that the Clinton Foundation has engaged in during and since Clinton’s time as Secretary of State. The Times reported that the Clinton Foundation received millions in previously undisclosed donations from a Canadian mining executive who sold uranium-mining stakes in the United States, with the approval of then-Secretary of State Clinton, to the Russian atomic energy agency.","439","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"It is inconceivable that Clinton and her team did not know that these donations would be a political liability. The way they responded to the allegations was indicative of how the Clinton machine usually responds when politically problematic issues are raised against them: they attacked the messenger and sought to frame all of the revelations as part of a conservative witch-hunt. But the magnitude of the allegations, as well as the outlet that the allegations were published in, make this strategy a problematic one.","440","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"We may never know the exact nature of the relationship between donors to the Clinton Foundation (which included foreign governments) and policy made while Clinton was Secretary of State. Her unwillingness to turn over all of the private emails from her time in the Obama administration makes a full accounting of these matters unlikely. But the circumstantial evidence alone is sure to cause nightmares for Clinton and her campaign.","441","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"

"This is the big question that has, thus far, gone basically unanswered. Clinton has been reticent to attack President Obama or any of his policies. Her unwillingness, for example, to address how she would distance herself from the failures of Obama’s foreign policy or how she would deal with ObamaCare if elected president, raise both political and substantive concerns.","443","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"Her public statements thus far suggest that Clinton hasn’t yet figured out how to navigate the terrain between the more progressive and conservative members of her party. In that sense, she will not be immune from the kind of intraparty sniping that is sure to appear in the crowded Republican primary field over the next several months.","444","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"
"This ankle-biting within Democratic ranks will become even more acute when others considering presidential runs, like former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley or former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, begin to sense that there is some political gain to be had by attacking Clinton’s obfuscation on key parts of the Obama record.","445","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/28/hillary-clinton-three-unanswered-questions-from-democrat-campaign-launch.html"

"She had that classified clearance so that she could do her job, which involved knowing and working with military, diplomatic and sensitive national security secrets. The government guards those secrets by requiring high-ranking government officials to keep the documents and emails that reflect them in a secure government-approved venue and to return any retained records when leaving office.","479","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/12/mr-obama-hillary-clinton-turned-law-on-its-head-dont-know-that.html"
"I have not seen Clinton’s signature on any documents, but standard government procedure is for her to have signed an agreement under oath when she began her work at the State Department requiring her to safeguard classified records, and another agreement under oath when she ended her work that she had returned all records to the government.","480","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/12/mr-obama-hillary-clinton-turned-law-on-its-head-dont-know-that.html"

"By using her personal email address -- @clintonemail.com -- she kept her work documents from the government.

"Failing to secure classified secrets in a government-approved facility or moving them to a non-secure facility outside the government’s control is a misdemeanor, punishable by a hefty fine and a year in jail. Using a false email address that gives the clear impression that the user is not using a government server when she is, or one that creates the false impression that the emailer is using a government server when she is not, is also a felony.","483","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/12/mr-obama-hillary-clinton-turned-law-on-its-head-dont-know-that.html"
"The legal issues in Clinton’s case are all the more curious when one hears Obama’s tepid reaction to this latest scandal. Asked by Bill Plante of CBS News last weekend when he first learned of Clinton’s use of a personal email server instead of the government’s, the president told Plante he learned of it from the media, last week, when the rest of us did. He later had his press secretary state that he did recognize her use of a non-governmental email address, but did not know it was unlawful or unsecured until last week.","484","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/12/mr-obama-hillary-clinton-turned-law-on-its-head-dont-know-that.html"

"I wish Plante had followed up with that question and more. Mr. President, are you not troubled that your secretary of state had a non-secure email account and used it for all of her work? Are you not troubled that she might have kept classified secrets on a server in her barn on her estate in Chappaqua, N.Y. that the Secret Service might or might not have known about, or at a computer company in Texas that the Secret Service was unable to protect?","486","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/12/mr-obama-hillary-clinton-turned-law-on-its-head-dont-know-that.html"
"Does it not trouble you, Mr. President, that foreign intelligence services likely would have had a far easier time hacking into the emails of your secretary of state because of all this? Mr. President, will your Department of Justice prosecute Clinton for retaining 48 months of classified records on her personal server after she left office, as it did Gen. David Petraeus, who kept 15 months of classified records in a desk drawer in his home after he left office?","487","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/12/mr-obama-hillary-clinton-turned-law-on-its-head-dont-know-that.html"
"Mr. President, the premise of the law regulating government records is that the government owns them all, and when a high-ranking government official leaves office, the ex-official may ask the government for copies of her personal emails, and the government decides which ones it will give her. Mr. President, don’t you realize that Clinton turned the law on its head by keeping all of her emails from the government?","488","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/12/mr-obama-hillary-clinton-turned-law-on-its-head-dont-know-that.html"
"Thus, rather than the government deciding which emails were personal, Clinton decided which emails were governmental, and she turned those over to the government. How does the government know what is contained in the emails she kept? Mr. President, this is a privilege that even you don’t have, and it is the very behavior that the laws you have sworn to uphold were written to prevent. Mr. President, did you cut a deal with Clinton’s husband that permits her to get away with this type of behavior? Mr. President, is it true that there are standards of behavior for Bill and Hillary Clinton and their friends and other standards for the rest of us? Mr. President, do you remember that crackpot Sandy Berger, who was Bill Clinton’s national security adviser from 1997 to 2001 and Mrs. Clinton’s foreign policy adviser when she ran against you in 2008, and who stole documents from the National Archives in 2003 by hiding them under an on-site construction trailer? Do you know that Bill got Sandy a no-jail-time deal including the return of his security clearance, and he got Sandy’s prosecutor a federal judgeship? Mr. President, when you ran against Hillary Clinton, you promised the most transparent government in history. Do you honestly think you have given us that?","489","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/12/mr-obama-hillary-clinton-turned-law-on-its-head-dont-know-that.html"

"Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Journal that she ""did the job that every secretary of state is supposed to do and what the American people expect of them—especially during difficult economic times.

"The latest report comes on the heels of the disclosure that donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation have increased considerably following the removal of a self-imposed ban on such contributions during Hillary's time as Secretary of State. Experts have said that the donation ban should be immediately re-imposed until Clinton formally decides one way or another whether she will seek the White House. On Thursday, the foundation said it would consider whether to accept such contributions should Clinton decide to run, but would not commit to rejecting such donations in the future.","496","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/20/hillary-clinton-ties-to-corporate-donors-lobbyists-while-secretary-state.html"
"The Journal report cites several examples of Clinton promoting eventual donors to the Foundation and its various activities. For example, in October 2012, she lobbied the Algerian government to contract General Electric to build power plants in that country. The following month, the Foundation approached the company about expanding a health-access initiative. An eventual partnership was formed, to which the company contributed between $500,000 and $1 million. The Algerian government awarded GE the power plant contract in September 2013.","497","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/20/hillary-clinton-ties-to-corporate-donors-lobbyists-while-secretary-state.html"

"In 2012, Clinton persuaded Bulgaria's government to issue a five-year license to Chevron allowing conventional gas exploration. That, too went nowhere. The following year, the Journal reports, Chevron donated $250,000 to the foundation. Exxon Mobil, for its part, has donated at least $18.8 million to various initiatives, including a nonprofit women's group called vital voices.","499","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/20/hillary-clinton-ties-to-corporate-donors-lobbyists-while-secretary-state.html"
"In at least one case, a sizable corporate monetary promise was made before a Clinton overseas trip. In 2012, Wal-Mart, a company with whom the Clintons have ties going back to their days in Arkansas, pledged $12 million to various causes supporting woman in Latin America. $1.5 million of that money went toward a Clinton Foundation public-private partnership and another $500,000 went to Vital Voices.","500","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/20/hillary-clinton-ties-to-corporate-donors-lobbyists-while-secretary-state.html"

"Wallace Henley, a Nixon staff assistant, responded to my email inquiring about Nixon’s several reinventions: “This reinvention came from Nixon’s intense pragmatism. I think of the man who won through the ‘Southern strategy’ (partly at least) becoming the champion of school desegregation, the fierce anti-communist becoming the man who went to Communist China, and the presumably free-market advocate declaring wage and price controls on August 15, 1971, a de facto taking over of the national economy by the federal government. Some of this, to be generous, was principled, but all revealed the element in his character that could reinvent itself as needed. Flexibility is good and essential in policy-making, but it also leads to an easily elastic character that can stretch itself to the Watergate cover-up, etc., etc. ... or, in another case, Whitewater acrobatics, Benghazi subterfuge, etc.”","512","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/14/does-hillary-clinton-think-american-voter-doesnt-know-who-is.html"

"In the early stages of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, she is being hoisted with her own petard. She is injuring herself with the very devices that she and her supporters use to injure others.","Published April 25, 2015","690","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"One device is the charge of “guilt by association.” The “millionaires and billionaires” she portrays as in villainous league with Republicans are the very same category of people who have donated tens of millions of dollars to both the Clinton Foundation and to speaking fees by Bill and Hillary Clinton. In Clintonworld, wealth that serves to oppose them is dirty but wealth that serves to support them is clean.","691","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"In the real world, that hypocrisy is having an effect. In a recent poll, a majority of U.S. voters—54%—now say that Hillary Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, a view shared by 61% of independents.","692","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"Another device the Clintons use against their opponents is coming back to haunt Hillary: charges of “conflicts of interest.” In Clintonworld, it is a conflict of interest when any Republican receives a contribution from, say, a natural resource tycoon or company. But it is a shared interest when the Clinton Foundation receives millions in contributions from a natural resource tycoon like Frank Giustra, who used Bill Clinton to help broker a deal that, as The New York Times has detailed, “brought [Russian President Vladimir] Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.”","693","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"As The Wall Street Journal added, “All the while, Mrs. Clinton was serving in her capacity as Secretary of State on the U.S. Cabinet committee that screens foreign investment for national-security risks. The group approved the deal, despite critics who warned it would give the Russian government control over the world’s nuclear fuel—the same material Vladimir Putin is now selling to Iran. Oh, and don’t forget this was also amid the famous ‘reset’ of relations with Mr. Putin.”","694","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"These machinations are investigated in Fox News Anchor Bret Baier’s special report (watch an excerpt here) called “The Tangled Clinton Web,” featuring an exclusive interview with Peter Schweizer, author of the soon-to-be-released book, “Clinton Cash.”","695","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"In Baier’s special report, specifics are given about another Clintonian device that is backfiring on Hillary: charging Republicans with a “cover-up” about anything the Clintons believe is unsavory.","696","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"Baier references this exclusive story that smacks of an uncovered Clinton cover-up. Reuters found that “Hillary Clinton's family's charities are refiling at least five annual tax returns after a Reuters review found errors…[which] generally take the form of under-reporting or over-reporting, by millions of dollars, donations from foreign governments, or in other instances omitting to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue.”","697","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"Baier told Fox News’ “The Five”: “There's a lot [of] ‘there’ there. Whether it leads to something bigger, we don't know. But when you lay it all out…it is compelling.”","698","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"

"The Clintons decry “tax breaks for the wealthy,” “a lack of transparency,” and “greed.” You see, tax breaks for the wealthy are obscene in Clintonian rhetoric, but tax breaks aren’t supposed to be seen or heard of when they apply, in practice, to Hillary and Bill Clinton’s wealth.","700","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"In Clintonworld, Republicans and their wealthy supporters exhibit “a lack of transparency” and are motivated by “greed.” But “The Tangled Clinton Web” being untangled by Bret Baier and other journalists reveals that the Clintons’ modus operandi involve, as New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, put it:","701","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"“…a place of blurred lines and fungible ethics and sleazy associates.

"What we are finding out (anew) is that in Clintonworld, Bill and Hillary charge their adversaries with “stonewalling,” being “out of touch,” and being “unfair.” Never mind that recent reporting is demonstrating all of those behaviors by the Clintons.","704","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"Indeed, when confronted with the facts, the Clintons and their spokespersons revert to yet another device that they deplore in their critics: the charge of a “conspiracy.”","705","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"
"In the Clinton camp’s response to the findings of the “Clinton Cash” book we hear another version of Hillary Clinton’s assertion that a “vast right wing conspiracy” was out to get her husband in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.","706","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/25/will-hillary-clinton-tangled-war-words-protect-her-from-clinton-foundation.html"

"Or to turn that question around, how much do the mainstream media resent Hillary Clinton?","713","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"The overwhelmingly negative reviews of her performance as Deleter of the Free World (to borrow the New York Post’s headline) span the spectrum. This isn’t the usual left-right dustup. The narrative that Hillary is blowing this is being driven by the media establishment, with the story broken by the New York Times and with many liberal commentators reacting with skepticism or outright criticism.","714","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"Hillary’s animosity toward the media, as I’ve noted, dates to the Whitewater/Travelgate/Filegate era, when the first lady often resisted disclosure and admitted that she had unrealistic expectations for a “zone of privacy.” She later blamed the Monica Lewinsky mess on a “vast right-wing conspiracy,” when of course her husband was having sexual relations with that woman.","715","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"While Hillary can charm reporters in one-on-one encounters, the media’s view of her as robotic, remote and inaccessible intensified during the 2008 campaign. I once trailed her for a long day in New Hampshire before, after much lobbying, I was able to sneak in a single question as she was leaving a nighttime event: Wouldn't providing more media access help get her message out?","716","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"""We try to balance what we do every day,"" Hillary told me. ""I'm trying to reach as many voters as possible one-on-one"" while also dealing with the local press and making time for occasional national interviews. ""It seems I have mushrooming demands. The balancing is really intense."" But of course the decision to rarely engage the national media was quite deliberate.","717","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"It was also in the ’08 campaign that MSNBC’s Chris Matthews apologized for what he called a “nasty” remark that Hillary owed her political career to the sympathy over her husband having “messed around.”","718","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"Much of the press was promoting Barack Obama, as Mark Halperin, then with Time, was quick to acknowledge: ""Your typical reporter has a thinly disguised preference that Barack Obama be the nominee. The narrative of him beating her is better than her beating him, in part because she's a Clinton and in part because he's a young African American. . . . There's no one rooting for her to come back.""","719","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"So why the lingering resentment? I think many journalists just don’t like the way Hillary Clinton plays the game. They view her as joyless, scripted and inauthentic—kind of like the “SNL” parody. Many were drawn to Bill Clinton’s love of politics and his pleasure in engaging with the media. Journalists like to be liked, or at least respected, and they sense that Hillary wishes she didn’t have to deal with them.","720","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"Thus we have Politico Editor-in-Chief John Harris, author of a Bill Clinton biography, saying the “unmistakable message” of Hillary’s Tuesday presser is “easily distilled into three short words: Go to hell…","721","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"“She’s not going to pretend that this latest uproar is on the level, that the reporters and politicians second-guessing her judgments and clamoring for more answers have anything but self-interested motives in fanning the controversy.”","722","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"Hillary also believes, says Harris, “that the pious clamor for more disclosure and more revelation is fundamentally insincere. The media-political complex is not seeking a window into matters of public interest; it is looking for a weapon, one that will be brandished to produce still more stories or start still more investigations.” National Journal’s Ron Fournier, who covered the Clintons in Arkansas, says:","723","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"“Rather than be transparent, completely honest, and accountable, Clinton doubled down on the 1990s… “Trust me, I'm a Clinton. This is part of a decades-old pattern: For all their strengths, Hillary and Bill Clinton have a weakness for victimization, entitlement, and their unbounded belief that the ends justify the means. Rules are for little people, not them.”","724","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"Slate’s John Dickerson also invoked the Hillary of that earlier decade:","725","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"“Hillary Clinton’s press conference could not have felt more Clinton. Those hoping this well-known accomplished woman would emerge as a new kind of candidate were disappointed on Tuesday. Instead, this was vintage Clinton from the 1990s: late, grudging, and incomplete.”","726","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"But even Salon’s Joan Walsh, a self-described Democrat, offered a very mixed review, saying Hillary “doesn’t get that when she has to face down the media, in a real or a trumped-up scandal, she is expected to take questions patiently and without seeming rattled or aggrieved, while at least trying to pretend that she doesn’t believe everyone in the room is hopelessly biased against her.","727","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"“So Clinton’s Tuesday press conference, in which she was alternately proud and defensive, probably didn’t convince anyone of anything they didn’t already believe. If you think she’s shady, then she surely looked shady to you, with her eyes too often cast down at her lectern, not at her audience. If you think she’s the persecuted victim of a vast and metastasizing right wing conspiracy, she handled an untenable situation the best anyone could.”","728","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"Liberal Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus is also bummed:","729","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"“My reaction to this episode is a combination of exasperation, sadness and a strong sense of deja vu. It’s exasperating because it’s all so unnecessary. Accepting Clinton’s asserted reason for relying on private e-mail, why does she get to play by different rules than other senior government officials, who juggle two devices? Why, understanding what a big target she is, knowing that her records were being sought, weren’t she and her aides more careful about compliance?”","730","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"And I haven’t even gotten to the conservatives yet. Let’s throw one in, the Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis:","731","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"“The larger, if more superficial, impression I was left with was the general feeling that she seemed utterly unlikable…","732","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"
"“In the absence of a smoking gun (which has likely been deleted), my guess is that — in the long run — much of politics comes down to things like likability and authenticity. And if this rollout was a harbinger of things to come, Hillary is in trouble. It’s become something of a cliche to say this, but it seems like she’s just not that good at (this part of) politics. And the problem is, at this level, you kind of have to be.”","733","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/12/no-love-lost-hillary-and-medias-mutual-animosity-society.html"

"Particular scrutiny – by Fox News, the Washington Post, and the New York Times – has focused on why the State Department, under Clinton’s leadership, green-lighted a foreign transaction that enriched major donors to the foundation while placing an estimated 20 percent of America’s stockpile of uranium - the fissile material that can be used to make nuclear weapons -under the control of a Kremlin-backed Russian firm.","739","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"It was, moreover, shortly after the uranium deal went through that former President Bill Clinton nailed down a $500,000 fee for a speaking event in Moscow.","740","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"“There’s certainly smoke there,” said Caleb Burns, a partner at the Washington law firm Wiley Rein LLC, who has long experience handling financial and public integrity cases. “The question’s going to be whether or not she took any official action in exchange for those donations. If she did, I think there is going to be a high, high likelihood of additional scrutiny, either from Capitol Hill or from the Department of Justice itself.”","741","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"Burns likened the known fact setting in the Clinton controversies to that which led to the federal indictment, earlier this month, of Sen. Robert Menendez, D-NJ, who stands accused of performing favors for a well-connected Democratic donor in exchange for pricey gifts. Menendez has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.","742","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"“If the facts suggest that there was a linkage between what Secretary Clinton did in her official capacity and the money that was coming into the Clinton Foundation,” Burns said, “this would fall under 18 U.S.C. 201 as a potential bribery violation.”","743","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"That statute provides that a bribe has occurred, among other circumstances, whenever “a public official directly or indirectly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such official.”","744","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"C. Boyden Gray, who served as White House counsel to President George H.W. Bush, told Fox News the money that linked the uranium deal to the Clintons and their foundation “is very hard to dissect from the personal,” and creates, at a minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest, particularly “when one of them is in office and money is coming in, in connection with issues over which that person in office has jurisdiction and responsibility.”","745","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"Gray added that Clinton is “not protected by the fact that her husband may have taken money … spouses’ interests are attributed to each other and that is no excuse or defense.”","746","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"In the tangle of cases brought to light by the book “Clinton Cash,” no one associated with the Clinton Foundation has been formally accused of wrongdoing. Lanny Davis, a former special counsel to President Clinton, told Fox News there is no evidence tying Hillary Clinton to the State Department’s approval of the uranium deal, and argued her critics are seeking to tarnish her 2016 presidential campaign on the basis of “inferences.”","747","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"“The people on that process -- on that board -- nine agencies approved the [uranium] deal, and the individual from State said he never heard from Mrs. Clinton,” Davis told Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on “America’s Newsroom” Friday. “There's no evidence that President Clinton, that I've seen yet, tried to influence any decision by any governmental agency.”","748","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"
"The Clintons, at any rate, are veterans of this terrain. In addition to her husband becoming the first president to be impeached – and ultimately acquitted – in over a century, in 1996 Hillary Clinton became the First Lady to testify before a grand jury.","749","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/24/veteran-defense-lawyers-see-possible-criminal-inquiry-for-clintons.html"

"The latest Obama administration scandal involving Hillary Clinton’s emails has many Americans discussing private email accounts used by government officials, and clarification is in order.","Published March 09, 2015","752","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"It’s appropriate and proper for a politician to use private email for personal and campaign business. This is what I did as governor of Alaska in order to be in compliance with the law, which requires that personal or campaign business not be conducted using public resources such as a government email account. There is a firm line separating the two.","753","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"However, that’s not what we see with this Clinton email scandal. As Secretary of State under Obama, Hillary Clinton used private email accounts on a privately maintained server 100 percent of the time for 100 percent government business. That’s unethical, no doubt illegal, and flies in the face of all claims of transparency. Hillary Clinton and her staff weren’t trying to be in compliance with the law; they were skirting it altogether.","754","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"Consider, for example, how Secretary Clinton’s private email server makes a mockery of transparency when it comes to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.","755","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"First, some background: I know something about how annoying FOIA requests can be for public officials. After I returned home from the 2008 vice presidential campaign, the state of Alaska was flooded with innumerable FOIA requests to see literally every single email I ever wrote while governor. It was an overwhelming request for a small population state with limited resources. But our system of government relies on transparency, and that means public officials must suck it up and let the public see whatever they want.","756","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"When FOIA requests bombarded us, investigators and our attorney general’s office were given full access to all of my state and private emails. The only emails redacted were the very few that were protected by attorney/client privilege – a determination agreed upon by my lawyers and the Attorney General’s office who reviewed them. In other words, an independent third party reviewed every email. There was no chance for any “smoking gun” to escape detection because nothing was kept secret in any way. Everything was done in the most transparent way possible.","757","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"Contrast that with the way Secretary Clinton has handled transparency. She created private email accounts for herself and her staff on a private email server that she controls completely.","758","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"She hasn’t handed over the server to any independent party for review, and it’s already too late to do so because for all we know someone might have already deleted any trace of incriminating emails to and from Secretary Clinton and her aides. This is the opposite of open and transparent government and obviously doesn’t follow the rules.","759","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"An honest politician has nothing to fear from the public seeing her emails. I know this. Eventually all but those few redacted emails of mine were released to the public and remain online to this day for anyone to read at any time.","760","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"In fact, the release of my emails was a great boon for Alaska’s tourism industry because dozens of national reporters descended on Alaska to pour through tens of thousands of pages of my emails looking for some smoking gun. They even crowd-sourced the work out to the general public to help them look for dirt! They were sorely disappointed.","761","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"All they found was evidence of an administration doing what the people sent us to do – work hard for them. My favorite summary of the email findings came from CNN’s Drew Griffin who reported: “I think what we’re seeing here is a hard-working governor, working hard for the state of Alaska, a lot of discussion about policy, about taxes, about cutting budgets, a lot of just mundane state government work.”","762","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"So, at least the media and the public learned a lot about conservative governance, responsible resource development, fiscal budgeting, Fish & Game management, and other scintillating topics.","763","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"But don’t take my word for it. Search the online databases of my emails created by the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and other national media sources... and be bored.","764","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"Now many of these same media outfits are pursuing access to Secretary Clinton’s emails. Will they put the same effort into her emails as they did mine?","765","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"Unfortunately for America, we have no way of knowing what’s already missing from among Secretary Clinton’s emails. In fact, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chair of the House select committee investigating Benghazi, explained that the emails she submitted to his committee contain huge gaps spanning months.","766","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"
"Good luck finding those missing emails. And good luck getting a straight answer from the Obama administration as to why no one in the White House noticed that the Secretary of State wasn’t using a government email account.","767","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/09/gov-palin-faced-tough-questions-over-email-so-should-hillary-clinton.html"

"“If you look back at the three hearings we have had so far, I have mentioned Hillary Clinton’s name a whopping zero times,” Gowdy said. “We were interviewing witnesses that have nothing to do with Secretary Clinton when this story broke.

"“They wanted to put off her testimony as far into the presidential cycle as possible,” he told Fox News. “The question is why are we handling this different?

"Gowdy suggested that the GOP-led House going to court to get the deleted emails would be a last resort and that the better course of action is Americans pressuring Clinton into turning over the server to a neutral third-party, such as a retired judge or an inspector general -- a deal to which Clinton seemed open during her press conference last week on the email issue.","778","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/15/gowdy-subpoenaing-clinton-email-is-last-resort-denies-benghazi-panel-created-to.html"

"“I have zero interest in looking at her personal emails,” Gowdy said. “But who gets to decide what’s personal and what’s public?

"Fox News has obtained a copy of a letter dated Dec. 13, 2012, that was sent from then-House Oversight Committee chair Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., to Cabinet secretaries, including Clinton, inquiring about their email habits. The committee was conducting an investigation into how the Obama administration handled the use of personal email by its officials.","785","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/15/hillary-clinton-was-first-asked-about-personal-email-use-in-2012-letter-shows.html"
"The letter contained eight questions related to officials' use of personal email accounts. The very first question asked by Issa was, ""Have you or any senior agency official ever used a personal email account to conduct official business? If so, please identify the account used."" Subsequent questions asked about whether ""alias email"" accounts and text messages were used to conduct official business.","786","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/15/hillary-clinton-was-first-asked-about-personal-email-use-in-2012-letter-shows.html"
"The fourth question asked for written documentation of agency archiving and record-keeping procedures as they related to the use of non-official email accounts, while the fifth question asked, ""Does the agency require employees to certify on a periodic basis or at the end of their employment with the agency they have turned over any communications involving official business that they have sent or received using nonofficial accounts?""","787","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/15/hillary-clinton-was-first-asked-about-personal-email-use-in-2012-letter-shows.html"
"Clinton's last day as secretary of state was Feb. 1, 2013, seven weeks after the date of Issa's letter, which requested a response by Jan. 7, 2013 at the latest. The New York Times reports that Issa's committee did not receive any response from the State Department until March 27, and even that amounted to a recounting of the department's email policy. The Times reported that the State Department's letter said that employees using personal accounts ""should make it clear that his or her personal email is not being used for official business.""","788","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/15/hillary-clinton-was-first-asked-about-personal-email-use-in-2012-letter-shows.html"
"Clinton's use of a personal email account, first reported last month by The New York Times, enabled her to shield most of her messages from scrutiny by members of Congress and the media. She has previously said she used one account for convenience because she did not want to go to the trouble of carrying more than one electronic device.","789","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/15/hillary-clinton-was-first-asked-about-personal-email-use-in-2012-letter-shows.html"

"I’ve long felt that people, organizations and foreign governments don’t hand over cash to the foundation just to be philanthropic.

"As of this SOTU address, he has doubled down, since many of the suggested tax hikes will land on small companies that pay taxes as individuals, and as his proposed sick pay and maternity leave will raise the costs of hiring. Such policies have led to labor participation rates that are still bumping along historical lows, a crisis in our disability program, and stagnant wages. A short course in economics might help the White House: a tighter jobs market will raise wages. The government raising wages will put people out of work.

"Obama revisited his familiar theme of making sure all Americans have a “fair shot”; he wants to raise taxes to make sure the rich do “their fair share.” He has never laid out what that share should be, but he has tried hard to convince Americans that the wealthy don’t play “by the same set of rules.”","885","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/20/obama-undermines-hillary-clinton-in-state-union-address.html"

"For six years Mr. Obama has blamed the GOP for standing in the way of his programs; now he will be the obstructer-in-chief. From his State of the Union address, it is clear that he is not interested in partnering with Republicans.

"Sent to diplomatic and consular staff in June 2011, the unclassified cable, bearing Clinton's electronic signature, made clear to employees they were expected to ""avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts."" The message also said employees should not ""auto-forward Department email to personal email accounts which is prohibited by Department policy.”","1123","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/06/exclusive-internal-cable-from-clinton-state-department-office-barred-use.html"
"The cable underscores that government policy strongly discouraged officials from using personal email and violators faced disciplinary action, even though Clinton for years relied exclusively on hers – and her own server -- to conduct official business. The White House, without condemning Clinton’s activities, has made clear that employees were urged to use government accounts.","1124","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/06/exclusive-internal-cable-from-clinton-state-department-office-barred-use.html"
"The 2011 cable, bearing the subject line “Securing Personal E-mail Accounts,” told employees to secure personal/home email addresses, given increased targeting of government employees by “online adversaries.” It also emphasized that these personal accounts should never be used for government business and cited department procedures which prohibit the practices.","1125","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/06/exclusive-internal-cable-from-clinton-state-department-office-barred-use.html"

Petraeus pleaded guilty this week to the improper storage of classified material, in this case keeping several black notebooks documenting his wartime career in an unlocked drawer.

Here is the backstory.","1160","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/02/hillary-s-secret-war.html"
"Turi is a lawfully licensed American arms dealer. In 2011, he applied to the Departments of State and Treasury for approvals to sell arms to the government of Qatar. Qatar is a small Middle Eastern country whose government is so entwined with the U.S. government that it almost always will do what American government officials ask of it.","1161","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/02/hillary-s-secret-war.html"
"In its efforts to keep arms from countries and groups that might harm Americans and American interests, Congress has authorized the Departments of State and Treasury to be arms gatekeepers. They can declare a country or group to be a terrorist organization, in which case selling or facilitating the sale of arms to them is a felony. They also can license dealers to sell.","1162","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/02/hillary-s-secret-war.html"
"Turi sold hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of arms to the government of Qatar, which then, at the request of American government officials, were sold, bartered or given to rebel groups in Libya and Syria. Some of the groups that received the arms were on the U.S. terror list. Thus, the same State and Treasury Departments that licensed the sales also prohibited them.","1163","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/02/hillary-s-secret-war.html"

"That’s where Clinton’s secret State Department and her secret war come in.

"Many of the rebels Clinton armed, using the weapons lawfully sold to Qatar by Turi and others, were terrorist groups who are our sworn enemies.

The obligation to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to Congress pertains to all witnesses who testify before congressional committees, whether an oath has been administered or not.

"Clinton admits deleting 30,000 government emails from her time in office. She claims they were personal, and that because they were also on a personal server, she was free to destroy them. Yet, federal law defines emails used during the course of one’s work for the federal government as the property of the federal government.","1210","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"
"She could have designated which of the government’s emails were personal and then asked the government to send them to her and delete them from government servers. Instead she did the reverse. She decided which of her emails were governmental and sent them on to the State Department. Under federal law, that is not a determination she may lawfully make.","1211","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"
"Yet, the 55,000 emails she sent to the feds were printed emails. By doing so, she stole from the government the metadata it owns, which accompanies all digital emails but is missing on the paper copies, and she denied the government the opportunity to trace those emails.","1212","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"
"When asked why she chose to divert government emails through her own server, Clinton stated she believed it would enable her to carry just one mobile device for both personal and governmental emails. She later admitted she carried four such devices.","1213","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"
"Then the scandal got more serious, as Clinton’s lawyers revealed that after she deleted the 30,000 emails, and printed the 55,000 she surrendered to the feds, she had the server that carried and stored them professionally wiped clean.","1214","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"

"Then the State Department inspector general concluded that one of the four was in fact top secret. Since it discussed satellite imagery of a foreign country and since it revealed intercepts of communications among foreign agents, it received additional legal protections that were intended to assure that it was only discussed in a secure location and never shared with a foreign government, not even an ally.","1217","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"
"When Clinton was confronted with these facts, she changed her explanation from “I did not send classified material” to “I never sent or never received any email marked classified.” Not only is she continually changing her story, but she is being deceptive again. Emails are not “marked classified.” They are marked “top secret” or “secret” or “confidential.” Her explanations remind one of her husband’s word-splitting playbook.","1218","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"

"What should be the consequence of her behavior with the nation’s most sensitive secrets?","1220","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"
"If Clinton is indicted for failure to secure classified information, she will no doubt argue that if one of the above markings was not on the email, she did not know it was top secret. If she does make that incredible argument -- how could satellite photos of a foreign country together with communications intercepts of foreign agents possibly not be top secret? -- she will be confronted with a judicial instruction to the jury trying her.","1221","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"
"The judge will tell the jury that the secretary of state is presumed to know what is top secret and what is not. The only way she could rebut that presumption is to take the witness stand in her own defense and attempt to persuade the jury that she was so busy, she didn’t notice the nature of the secrets with which she was dealing.","1222","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"
"Not only would such an argument be incredible coming from a person of her intellect and government experience, but it begs the question. That’s because by using only her own server, she knowingly diverted all classified emails sent to her away from the government’s secure venue. That’s the crime.","1223","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html"

The emailing Marine was indicted for failure to secure classified materials. Gen.

"From my own examination of what Clinton has done and said as well as what State Department officials have said it seems quite clear that whatever rules and regulations may have been violated – though that’s not clear either – there was hardly any criminal intent. Let me be clear, there was certainly intent to promote secrecy and it was ill advised to do what she did. But I think as Judge Michael Mukasey, the former Attorney General, said on ""Fox News Sunday,"" that she has potentially committed a number of felonious acts probably goes too far.

"Clinton should have been sufficiently aware of what was “classifiable.” Classified subjects are frequently discussed sans paper. Oral briefings are common for government officials.

Nevertheless, when a government official receives an oral classified briefing, he or she is obligated to understand the nature of the information and to protect it appropriately.","1260","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/13/truth-about-hillary-clintons-email-server-and-law.html"

In fact, Qatar is in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood and is one of the biggest supporters of global jihad in the world -- and Clinton, who approved the sales of arms to Qatar expecting them to make their way to Syrian and Libyan rebels, as they did, knew that. She and her State Department caused American arms to come into the possession of known Al Qaeda operatives, a few of whom assassinated U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.","1270","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., asked Clinton in January 2013 at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing whether she knew of any weapons coming from the U.S. and going to rebels in the Middle East, she denied such knowledge. She either has a memory so faulty that she should not be entrusted with any governmental powers, or she knowingly lied.","1271","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"It gets worse.","1272","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"It now appears that Clinton was managing her war using emails that she diverted through a computer server owned by her husband’s charitable foundation, even though some of her emails contained sensitive and classified materials. This was in direct violation of federal law, which requires all in government who possess classified or sensitive materials to secure them in a government-approved venue.","1273","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"The inspector general of the intelligence community and the inspector general of the State Department each have reviewed a limited sampling of her emails that were sent or received via the Clinton Foundation server, and both have concluded that materials contained in some of them were of such gravity that they were obliged under federal law to refer their findings to the FBI for further investigation.","1274","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"The FBI does not investigate for civil wrongdoing or ethical lapses. It investigates behavior that may be criminal or that may expose the nation’s security to jeopardy. It then recommends either that indictments be sought or the matter be addressed through non-prosecutorial means. Given Clinton’s unique present position -- as the president’s first secretary of state and one who seeks to succeed him, as well as being the wife of one of his predecessors -- it is inconceivable that she could be prosecuted as Gen. David Petraeus was (for the crime of failing to secure classified materials) without the personal approval of the president himself.","1275","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"Let’s be realistic and blunt: If the president wants Clinton prosecuted for failing to secure classified materials, then she will be, no matter the exculpatory evidence or any political fallout. If he does not want her prosecuted, then she won’t be, no matter what the FBI finds or any political fallout.","1276","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"I have not seen the emails the inspectors general sent to the FBI, but I have seen the Clinton emails, which are now in the public domain. They show Clinton sending or receiving emails to and from her confidante Sid Blumenthal and one of her State Department colleagues using her husband’s foundation’s server, and not a secure government server. These emails address the location of French jets approaching Libya, the location of no-fly zones over Libya and the location of Stevens in Libya. It is inconceivable that an American secretary of state failed to protect and secure this information.","1277","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"But it is not inconceivable that she would lie about it.","1278","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"Federal statutes provide for three categories of classified information. “Top secret” is data that, if revealed, could likely cause grave damage to national security. “Secret” is data that, if revealed, could likely cause serious damage to national security. “Confidential” is data that, if revealed, could likely cause some damage to national security. Her own daily calendars, which she regularly emailed about, are considered confidential.","1279","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"Clinton has repeatedly denied ever sending or receiving data in any of these categories. She probably will argue that an email that fails to use the terminology of the statute cannot be deemed classified. Here the inspectors general have corrected her. It is the essence of the data in an email -- its potential for harm if revealed -- that makes its contents classified and the failure to protect it a crime -- not the use of a magic word or phrase in the subject line.","1280","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"
"She is no doubt lying again, just as she did to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Yet the question remains: Why did she use her husband’s foundation’s computer server instead of a government server, as the law requires? She did that so she could obscure what the server recorded and thus be made to appear different according to history from how she was in reality. Why did she lie about all this? Because she thinks she can get away with it.","1281","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-lies-again.html"

"This is, well, standard operating procedure. Both sides spend a fortune conducting polls and focus groups and honing messages that will be most effective in tearing down the opposition candidate.

"What’s more, the Times knows full well that the liberals do the same thing: “Republicans are acutely aware that early attacks labeling Mitt Romney as elitist were impossible for him to shake in 2012, and they view these next several months as critical in laying the groundwork to taint, and ultimately defeat, Mrs. Clinton.”","1317","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/14/vilifying-hillary-clinton-new-york-times-wary-conservative-oppo-research.html"
"And who did those early attacks on Mitt come from? President Obama’s campaign and the Democratic establishment. You might even say they were vilifying him.

"So let’s fire up the Google machine and see how the Times handled it when Priorities USA went after Mitt. Here’s a piece that said the group was “highlighting a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and suggesting that Mitt Romney’s plans would raise taxes on the middle class while cutting them for the wealthy.” Here’s another one on how the Priorities commercials —“including the ‘coffin ad,’ featuring workers laid off from a plant acquired by Bain Capital, Mr. Romney’s former firm — helped define Mr. Romney early in the campaign.” See? Romney wasn’t vilified by a liberal PAC, he was “defined.” The Times says American Crossroads found, for example, that Hillary’s comment about she and her husband having been “dead broke” when they left the White House did not play well in the focus group. But most pundits could have told you it was damaging the moment she said it during last year’s book tour.","1319","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/14/vilifying-hillary-clinton-new-york-times-wary-conservative-oppo-research.html"
"The story did spotlight an interesting note: “One problem in developing negative messages about Mrs. Clinton, Republican strategists have found, is that she and her husband have survived so many controversies by dismissing them as partisan attacks. So the Republican organizations are seeking to develop lines of attack that resonate more deeply or raise unsettling questions about Mrs. Clinton’s character.”","1320","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/14/vilifying-hillary-clinton-new-york-times-wary-conservative-oppo-research.html"
"Meanwhile, Time magazine has a glowing cover story on Elizabeth Warren, touting her liberal agenda and the way she’s moving the Democratic Party to the left. There is nary a critical sentence about the Massachusetts senator. Why put her on the cover when she’s not running for president and hasn’t done anything particularly new? Why not Bernie Sanders, who is running for president and has embraced essentially the same populist, break-up-the-banks agenda? Probably because Elizabeth as the cover girl sells more copies. Time recently included Warren on its 100 Most Influential People list. And who wrote the accompanying piece on how she “never lets us forget that the work of taming Wall Street’s irresponsible risk taking and reforming our financial system is far from finished”? Hillary Clinton.","1321","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/14/vilifying-hillary-clinton-new-york-times-wary-conservative-oppo-research.html"

Her defenders will be searching through the electronic missives to find vindication, her critics parsing every key stroke to prove wronging, at least politically.

"What then is the truth about her emails? Clinton’s admirers say they show a good public servant who made, in hindsight, a bad but defendable choice to run all her business through one private email account and server.

"Initially, two documents containing “top-secret” intelligence matters were discovered among the emails on her private server.

"Storing classified information at an unauthorized location (and/or transmitting it therefrom) is a crime. Pure and simple. Knowledge of its classification status is of no legal consequence.

"Which invites another salient question: How could she not know? As Secretary of State, she was privy to many of our nation’s most-guarded secrets. Did they have to be specifically marked “Top Secret” or “Classified” for her to recognize them for what they were? For four years, she was America’s top diplomat with direct access to the most sensitive information and data. It should have been recognized by her instantaneously.","1344","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/18/hillary-clinton-s-email-defense-is-no-defense-under-law.html"

"“This confirms doubts about the completeness of Clinton’s self-selected public record and raises serious questions about her decision to erase her personal server—especially before it could be analyzed by an independent, neutral third party arbiter,” Gowdy said.","1436","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/25/state-dept-15-emails-missing-from-clinton-cache.html"
"When asked for comment by Fox News, a Clinton official said ""not only did she turn over all emails that she had from Blumenthal, she actually turned over more than a dozen emails that were not included in what he handed over to the House committee. We do not have a record of other correspondence between her and Mr. Blumenthal beyond that which was turned over to the State Department.”","1437","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/25/state-dept-15-emails-missing-from-clinton-cache.html"

"Clinton's use of the non-governmental email while in office was not publicly disclosed until earlier this year, after the committee sought her correspondence related to the Benghazi attack. She says the single account for personal and professional purposes was a matter of convenience, and says all her work emails were included in the 55,000 pages of documents she later handed over to the State Department. Clinton claims that emails of a personal nature were destroyed.","1439","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/25/state-dept-15-emails-missing-from-clinton-cache.html"

"The emails missing from the State Department's records include missives from Blumenthal in which he sends media accounts about the killing of one of Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi's sons, various reports on internal politics among Libya's rebels and news of the assassination of a former Qaddafi minister in Vienna.","1441","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/25/state-dept-15-emails-missing-from-clinton-cache.html"

"Gowdy said that Blumenthal has never been to Libya, is not an expert on the country and therefore “has no idea” as to the validity of the information he was sending to Clinton.","1443","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/25/state-dept-15-emails-missing-from-clinton-cache.html"
"“Not only was [Blumenthal] providing unvetted, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated intelligence to our top diplomat, he was just simply forwarding on intelligence that somebody by the name of Tyler Drumheller was sending him,” Gowdy said.","1444","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/25/state-dept-15-emails-missing-from-clinton-cache.html"
"Clinton's responses to Blumenthal’s emails are brief. In one from March 2012, she passes on an adviser's skepticism regarding one of Blumenthal's reports about political intrigue in post-Qaddafi Libya, saying: ""This strains credulity based on what I know. Any other info about it?""","1445","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/25/state-dept-15-emails-missing-from-clinton-cache.html"
"And after a long August 2012 note from Blumenthal about Libya's new interim President Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf, Clinton writes: ""Another keeper -- thanks and please keep `em coming."" Four days later, she responds to a follow-up reports about el-Magariaf, saying: ""Fascinating. I had a very good call w him.""","1446","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/25/state-dept-15-emails-missing-from-clinton-cache.html"
"Gowdy said Thursday that the emails show Clinton ""was soliciting and regularly corresponding with Sidney Blumenthal -- who was passing unvetted intelligence information about Libya from a source with a financial interest in the country.

"Hillary Clinton will attempt to reinvent herself for the umpteenth time on Monday‎ when she releases her ""new"" economic agenda for the working class. Except that from what the Clinton team released over the weekend this is not much more than Obama retreads -- and that hasn't worked out so well for middle America. Let's see: she wants more infrastructure spending, higher taxes on the foreign earnings of U.S. Corporations and hedge fund managers, a higher minimum wage, new rules to make it easier to form unions ( card check), more child care subsidies, expanded paid medical leave for workers, and renewable energy subsidies. Sound familiar? It's more taxes, more regulatory burdens on employers, the green agenda, more government spending paid for with debt. One looks at the list of leftist wish list priorities from yesteryear and wonders: Hillary, is this thin gruel really all you've got? There aren't even hints of her husband's New Democrat agenda that generated growth and reform of government. The free trade, welfare reform, balanced budget, middle class tax cuts, sound money New Democrat agenda has vanished.","Published July 13, 2015","1464","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-new-economic-agenda-really-just-recycled-ideas-from-team-obama.html"
"Sadly, Ms. Clinton is slamming the door on the successful centrist agenda of her husband and perhaps for good. Why? Because her political challenger Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, an avowed socialist, is pulling Hillary and the party in her direction. ‎What's next from Hillary, a call for 70 percent tax rates? Here's Hillary's unavoidable dilemma: ‎her theme is to advance economic policies that benefit ""everyday Americans."" But the leftist Obamanomics 2.0 agenda she will announce Monday has been tried for six and a half years now. She says the key to economic progress is not the 4 percent growth that Jeb Bush and other Republicans are pushing, but middle class raises.","1465","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/13/hillary-clintons-new-economic-agenda-really-just-recycled-ideas-from-team-obama.html"
"But under Obama the middle class has gotten pummeled. Middle class household incomes are lower today adjusted for inflation than when the recovery started. ‎Inequality has risen, not fallen under these redistribution policies. Meanwhile, every poll shows the middle class is angry and anxious about the pint-sized economic recovery and the prospects for achieving the American Dream for their children. Hillary's betting that she can win on an agenda of more of the same when the nation is hungry for a new direction. Pitifully, Hillary won't -- or politically can't -- advance a genuine agenda of new ideas inside today's demented Democratic party dominated by the progressive left. They won't let her move in a centrist direction. So much for hope and change. So with Hillary's cupboard is bare when it comes to fixing the economy, Republicans need to respond to the let's vast policy wasteland with a robust platform of reforms to government -- health care, taxes, entitlements, the regulatory state, the IRS, 21st century America-first energy, and a war against waste and Washington incompetence.

"White House documents in the Clinton Library reviewed by The Associated Press show Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton were kept apprised about a tax reduction package that would have benefited donors, including those to his presidential library, by reducing their tax burden. An interagency task force set up by Bill Clinton's executive order proposed those breaks along with deductions to middle-class taxpayers who did not itemize their returns.

"Federal law does not prevent fundraising by a presidential library during a president's term.

"The tax changes would have indirectly helped the Clinton Foundation -- as well as many other U.S. charities -- by freeing nonprofits' investments and donations that otherwise would have gone into tax payments. A reduction of the excise tax would have boosted the assets of private foundations. Higher deductions for appreciated investments and property would have also aided the Clinton Foundation, which accepts non-cash gifts. In 2010, for example, the charity declared more than $5 million in donated securities on its federal tax returns.","1478","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/22/documents-show-hillary-clinton-pushed-tax-breaks-for-nonprofits-while-husband.html"

Clinton seems to be confirming that she destroyed her email records (and all backups, according to her attorney) in early December, which would be three months before the Benghazi committee subpoena. So Clinton's argument is: There's no way I was subject to a subpoena because I destroyed everything before the subpoena was issued.","1499","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/clinton-email-answers-dont-answer-key-question.html?intcmp=trending"

"Hillary Clinton’s physician released a letter regarding her health on Friday that ended with an endorsement: “She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as President of the United States.”","Published August 04, 2015","1501","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/hillarys-health-what-concerns-this-physician.html"
"But can an internist like Dr. Lisa Bardack of the Mount Kisco Medical Group possibly know if a person is medically fit to be president? Or do the stresses and conditions of the presidency have an impact that is impossible to predict? This, after all, isn’t the same as clearing someone to run a marathon.","1502","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/hillarys-health-what-concerns-this-physician.html"
"I’ll tell you what Dr. Bardack does know. She knows that in December 2012, “Mrs. Clinton was found to have a transverse sinus thrombosis and began anticoagulation therapy to dissolve the clot.” She knows that Clinton subsequently tested negative for all clotting disorders. But in my opinion, given that Clinton also suffered deep venous thrombosis in her legs in 1998 and in 2009, the tendency to form blood clots remains.","1503","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/hillarys-health-what-concerns-this-physician.html"
"Does this mean that Clinton is not physically fit to be president? No, it does not. One of our greatest presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt, famously spent much of his presidency in a wheelchair. But if the voters had known how sick he was when they elected him that fourth time, would they have willfully allowed him to join the ranks of presidents who died in office?","1504","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/hillarys-health-what-concerns-this-physician.html"
"The health of presidential candidates is fair game, especially if there are legitimate concerns. Hillary’s father died after having a stroke, and one of her brothers has premature heart disease. According to Dr. Bardack, Clinton’s LDL (bad) cholesterol is 118, which is not ideal, though she does have a coronary calcium score of zero, which is excellent and predicts a very low risk of heart disease, despite her family history. Bardack also notes that Clinton exercises regularly and eats a diet “rich in lean protein, vegetables, and fruits,” which is also excellent, and I believe her low thyroid disease is extremely common, easy to treat and inconsequential.","1505","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/hillarys-health-what-concerns-this-physician.html"
"So the only worrisome issue is Clinton’s history of blood clots, especially the one in the brain, and her need for long-term blood thinners (Coumadin). She could still have a stroke or another blood clot in the legs that travels to the lungs.","1506","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/hillarys-health-what-concerns-this-physician.html"
"In 2008 at a hotel outside Phoenix, I joined a bevy of journalists who pored through Sen. John McCain’s health records for signs that his melanoma could recur. I believe Hillary’s health risks are worse that McCain’s, because of the real risk of another life threatening blood clot or stroke compared with the remote risk of melanoma recurrence in McCain (his melanoma history was ten years old by the time he ran in 2008). But I doubt the left-leaning news media will give Hillary’s health issues the same obsessive attention they gave McCain’s. This is because they are rooting for Hillary to win and were rooting against McCain. It is unfortunate that health and politics are so difficult to separate.","1507","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/hillarys-health-what-concerns-this-physician.html"
"Coumadin therapy is not a reason you can’t run for president. Three million people take the drug in the U.S., and most do not have serious side effects. But a history of blood clots is a reason for extreme caution, especially on long plane flights. Taking Coumadin means you really have to watch your step, something one could easily forget amid the enormous pressures of the presidency.","1508","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/04/hillarys-health-what-concerns-this-physician.html"

"She reached this decision after an internal debate and the move is supported by many top campaign officials, along with her husband, Clinton insiders say.","1516","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"“She’s all on board,” Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign’s communications director, told me in an interview. “America will see more of her.”","1517","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"Palmieri played down the notion that the interviews, along with plans to take more questions from reporters on the trail, amount to a risky strategy. “She does fine,” Palmieri says. “That was not a concern.”","1518","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"The danger, Clinton insiders tell me, is that in today’s Twitter culture, a single misstep or badly chosen phrase can be taken out of context and go viral, drowning out anything else that Clinton is saying. They are also worried that some reporters, given Hillary’s global fame, might try to boost themselves by creating a “gotcha” moment.","1519","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"But a consensus has formed around the notion that allowing more routine access will drain the drama from each encounter. “The more media interviews you do, the less any one interaction matters,” Palmieri says.","1520","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"The former president and first lady, as well as campaign chairman John Podesta and others, are said to recognize that keeping the press at arm’s length has damaged her campaign. They concede that her long periods of silence in the face of swirling questions about her private email, speaking fees and Clinton Foundation favor-seeking have hurt her on the crucial issue of public trust.","1521","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"By not doing national interviews until now, Palmieri concedes, “we’re sacrificing the coverage. We’re paying a price for it.”","1522","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"For two months after her campaign launch, Clinton took virtually no questions from her traveling press corps, a strategy symbolized by her impromptu stop at a Chipotle. After her kickoff speech on Roosevelt Island, she sat down with a handful of local reporters in key states, but that was about it on the interview front.","1523","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"The distancing approach creates a news vacuum that is often filled by stories about the latest release of her emails or questions about the family foundation. It contributes to a backlog of negative questions that can erupt each time reporters have a chance to shout questions at the candidate. And it provides a sharp contrast with Bernie Sanders, who is generating headlines for both his populist rhetoric and the size of his crowds.","1524","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"But Palmieri says Clinton thought long and hard about how to campaign after her 2008 loss. “She thought about what she does best with voters, which is a big deal—the one-on-one interaction.” That, she says, is why the campaign began in Iowa and New Hampshire with small events at which the former secretary of State mostly listened. Meanwhile, journalistic frustration mounted and began a running theme in the Hillary coverage.","1525","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"“I’m always trying to balance letting the press have access but not having that get too much in the way of what she needs to do in her campaign,” says Palmieri, a former communications director in the Obama White House. In the end, “This is her campaign.”","1526","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"If Hillary coasts to the Democratic nomination, the insiders say, her only real opponent would be the media. But even then, she needs some capital in the bank for when major controversies erupt—capital that can be earned by developing relationships with the journalists who cover her.","1527","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"This may help only at the margins, the sources say. But it might help with the problem that most people have a brittle image of Hillary, rarely glimpsing her more engaging side--a longstanding frustration in her inner circle.","1528","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"
"Every campaign grapples with some version of this dilemma, whether having the candidate grant too many interviews or answer too many questions at events will wind up obscuring the message of the day.","1529","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/05/after-long-drought-hillary-to-broaden-media-access-grant-more-interviews.html"

"A new list of donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation shows a marked surge in donations and the numbers of contributors to the family charity in the first half of this year -- at the same time that Hillary Rodham Clinton ramped up her campaign for the presidency.","Published July 31, 2015","1534","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"Clinton Foundation officials said figures released Thursday show that overall giving to the charity is up compared to the first half of 2014. The foundation has declined to provide specific donation amounts or the precise timing of its thousands of contributions.","1535","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"There have been more than 10,500 donors so far this year compared with 8,800 in the first half of last year, foundation officials said. As many as 40 separate donors previously listed by the foundation appeared to have been dropped without explanation on the new release. A foundation spokesman said late Thursday that in most cases those donors remained on the list, but were listed under alternate names at the request of the contributors.","1536","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"The foundation's latest list shows that even as Hillary Clinton began campaigning and attending lucrative fundraisers in advance of the 2016 race, some of her top political supporters were increasing their donations to the Clinton Foundation, as were numerous corporations and foreign governments with interests before the U.S. government.","1537","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"""We know that donors are giving more because they are seeing the impact of our work across the globe,"" said the foundation's new president, Donna Shalala, who was accompanying Bill and Hillary Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, on a tour of foundation programs in Haiti.","1538","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"An Associated Press analysis of the list shows that donors increasing their stakes in the foundation during the first six months of this year included veteran Democratic fundraisers Haim Saban, S. Daniel Abraham and Barbara Streisand, either personally or through their charitable arms.","1539","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"Shalala, who was Health and Human Services Secretary in Bill Clinton's administration, is among a number of Clinton loyalists who also boosted their donations this year. Others include Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining magnate who is one of the top donors to the foundation at more than $25 million, and data entrepreneur Vinod Gupta.","1540","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"The Clintons themselves, through their private Clinton Family Foundation, also upped their ante to between $5 million and $10 million. In May, Hillary Clinton disclosed that she and her husband made more than $25 million from speeches over the past year and a half.","1541","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"In some cases, new donations were substantial. This year's giving increased the total amount donated by the J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation to more than $5 million. The foundation for the wealthy Pritzker family had previously given in the range of $1 million to $5 million. Penny Pritzker, secretary of commerce in the Obama administration, is a longtime Democratic fundraiser.","1542","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"Major corporate interests either stepped up donations this year by giving directly or gave through their corporate foundations. Among them were Barclays, Citigroup and HSBC banks, Duke Energy, Cisco, Dell, Toyota and Chevron.","1543","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"In about 40 cases, the foundation's list no longer carried the names of previously listed donors, including corporations, charities, partnerships, individual donors and the country of Germany. Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said the entries were altered, not dropped. He added that ""we did correct some names per the request of the organization or to make the listing accurately reflect who the donation was from."" Minassian did not cite specific examples.","1544","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"In other cases, the foundation altered the names of previously listed donors in ways as insignificant as adding an extra comma or hyphen in a corporate name, adding a person's middle initial or adding or removing the name of a donor's spouse, which can make it difficult to track contributions over time from the same sources. In some cases, changes were made to listings of names of people, companies or organizations that did not give any additional money during the first half of 2015.","1545","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/31/clinton-charity-donors-surge-amid-hillary-clinton-campaign.html"
"The Clinton Foundation agreed earlier this year to stop taking funding from most foreign governments.

"The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), representing 350,000 small businesses nationwide, did a comprehensive review of Hillary Clinton’s voting record when she was a U.S. senator. The NFIB found that Clinton voted against policies favored by small businesses most of the time in several areas, such as spurring economic recovery and growth, increasing access to lower health insurance costs, eliminating frivolous lawsuits and providing tax relief.","1621","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"

"And, reviewing Hillary Clinton’s recent economic plan, which included recommendations relating to small businesses, Bill Curry, former adviser to President Bill Clinton wrote, “The country could use a fresh, unbiased analysis of the existing order. Clinton’s speech provided nothing of the sort [and] if you parse Hillary’s speech you find that despite talking for 55 minutes she didn’t make any promises, or at least none specific enough to be politically actionable. Aides say she must seem more authentic, but it can’t help that her policies are so vague or that her anecdotes seem so canned. Clinton says she wants to be the ‘small-business president.’ I think she means it, but I don’t think she knows what it means.”","1623","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"
"The proof is that Clinton has made statements demonstrating just how out of touch she is not only with the real world problems of small businesses, but also with the facts.","1624","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"
"For example, on the campaign trail in Keene, NH, Clinton said, ""From my perspective, I want to be sure that we get small businesses starting and growing in America again. We have stalled out. I was very surprised to see thatwhen I began to dig into it because people were telling me this, as I traveled around the country the last two years, but I didn’t know what they were saying, and it turns out that we’re not producing as many small businesses as we used to. And a recent world study said that we are 46th in the world in the difficulty to start a small business.”","1625","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"
"She was “surprised” that small businesses are struggling during the Obama-Clinton years of big government control? If Clinton is as well informed as her supporters believe, she couldn’t have missed that The Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank, found as far back as last year that “for the first time on record U.S. businesses are being destroyed faster than they're being created.” And surely she has heard that for years, small businesses have blamed stunted job creation and business growth on laws and policies that Clinton is on record as enthusiastically backing -- notably ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank.","1626","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"
"As Investor Business Daily reported, “A 2013 Gallup poll found that ObamaCare caused nearly half of small businesses to freeze hiring and a fifth of them to cut jobs. Another 38 percent of entrepreneurs said they ‘have pulled back on their plans to grow their business because of ObamaCare. Meanwhile, small-business owners complain that new financial regulations mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act have dried up startup capital.”","1627","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"
"A survey released by the National Small Business Association in 2014 found that complying with Obamacare costs a small business, on average, more than $15,000 a year.","1628","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"
"Holly Wade, NFIB’s research director, told the Senate Finance Committee in March that because of ObamaCare, “62 percent of small business owners are paying higher premiums, while only 8 percent say their costs have dropped.”","1629","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"
"In a LinkedIn post titled “Four Ways to Jump-Start Small Business,” Clinton listed “cutting red tape, expanding access to capital, providing tax relief and tax simplification, and expanding access to new markets.”","1630","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"
"Yet, in complete contradiction to each of those proposals is Clinton’s record documenting her votes for higher taxation, higher regulation and higher amounts of litigation, strangling small businesses. According to the friendliness-to-small-business rating system of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, “during her tenure in the U.S. Senate, Clinton scored 7 percent in 2001-2002, 21 percent in 2004, and 9 percent in 2005.”","1631","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"
"As PJ Media’s Ed Driscoll recalled, “When told [in 1994, that HillaryCare, the prototype for ObamaCare] could bankrupt small businesses, Mrs. Clinton sighed, “I can’t be responsible for every undercapitalized small business in America.” Twenty years later, in the run-up to her presidential bid, Clintontold a political rally in Boston that, “Don’t let anybody tell you that, ah, you know, it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs.”","1632","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/24/clinton-as-champion-small-business-that-s-hill-arious.html"

"Hillary Clinton thinks she has touched a populist nerve with the American middle class with her $350 billion ten year plan to make college more affordable. And in some ways she has.

"She’s right that colleges are unaccountable, lack transparency and are often overpriced.

"There are now dozens of colleges this year that charge more than $50,000 a year in room, board and tuition. That is a betrayal.

"But Hillary’s plan would only make the crisis worse by having the taxpayers foot even a larger share of the cost of tuition. She wouldn’t make it free, but only a small fraction of college cost would be borne by the students and families.

"Her plan would provide dollars to states that agree to provide ""no-loan tuition at four-year public colleges and universities."" States that agree, under the Clinton plan, will win multi-billion dollar grants from the federal government. She also want to make community college free.

"The fundamental problem is that most universities are charging about double what they should. No one wants to look under the hood of the Ivory Towers and find out where money is being wasted. It’s called accountability and that is what is lacking at most universities. If state schools are getting a bigger wad of cash from the federal government through the states, their costs and extravagancies will rise, not fall.","1704","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/11/hillary-clintons-plan-makes-college-evn-more-unaffordable.html"
"Even worse is that Hillary wants to pay for this transfer to the universities by taxing the rich. (This is on top of her plan to raise the capital gains tax to 43 percent.) But the rich already pay 40 percent of the income tax and since these taxes will mostly be collected from business owners, this will mean fewer jobs available for the students when they graduate.","1705","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/11/hillary-clintons-plan-makes-college-evn-more-unaffordable.html"
"A better way for colleges to become more affordable is to start forcing universities with multibillion dollar endowments – Harvard and Yale are at or above $20 billion – to use the money to lower tuition costs to students. There are dozens of colleges that could pay 80 percent of the tuition out of their endowments and not run out of money over many decades if ever.","1706","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/11/hillary-clintons-plan-makes-college-evn-more-unaffordable.html"
"What is wrong, by the way, with asking 19 to 22-year-olds to work at least 10-25 hours a week to help pay for their own education.

"The proposal centers on a $200 billion federal incentive system aimed at encouraging states to expand their investments in higher education and cut student costs.

"Clinton's plan doesn't go quite as far as some more liberal politicians and Democratic activists, who've made ""debt-free college"" an early litmus test for the presidential primary field. In May, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released his own plan that would eliminate tuition and fees for public universities.

"While military veterans, lower-income students and those who complete a national service program, like AmeriCorps, would go to school for free in the Clinton plan, others would incur costs for their schooling and living expenses at four-year public universities. ""For many students, it would translate into debt-free tuition,"" said Carmel Martin, executive vice president for policy at the Center for American Progress, who advised Clinton on that plan.

"Those currently repaying loans would be able to refinance their outstanding debt at lower rates, a change Clinton's aides say will save an average of $2,000 for 25 million borrowers over the life of the loan -- an amount that equal to just about $17 month over a ten year repayment period.

"The cost of Clinton's plan would be offset by capping itemized tax deductions for wealthy families at 28 percent, like those taken by high-income taxpayers for charitable contributions and mortgage interest.

"FIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: POLL SHOWS HILLARY WAY UNDER WATER IN SWING STATES In a poll of voters in the six make-or-break swing states, Hillary Clinton now trails a generic Republican opponent by 13 points – a jump from last month’s 8-point deficit. The poll, which will be released later today, was conducted for the pro-GOP group American Crossroads by pollsters Vox Populi. The telephone survey included 1,908 registered voters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia. While the Republican nominee will certainly have greater liabilities than a generic standard bearer – though likely some advantages, as well – a deficit of this size is bad news for Clinton as she looks to head off other potential intra-party rivals. Clinton’s best argument for the nomination is her own inevitability. If she is seen as a potential loser with the general electorate, Democrats could easily be forgiven for backing a candidate they like and trust more. The reason for Clinton’s decline with the swing-state general electorate is not hard to discern. Trust for Clinton waned notably since last month’s survey. In July, 41 percent of respondents expressed at least some degree of trust for the former secretary of state. This month, that’s fallen to 37 percent. Distrust of Clinton, which clocked in at 56 percent last month has climbed all the way to 60 percent. It’s bad enough to be 23 points underwater on trustworthiness in general but maybe worst of all is that 47 percent this month said they “completely distrust” Clinton. Clinton’s net favorability fell sharply, too. She was 15 points below the beam last month. This time, it’s at negative 21 percent. That doesn’t necessarily reflect her potential vote share since people will sometimes (albeit rarely) vote for a candidate they do not like or trust, but -23 on trust and -21 on favorable is a dog’s breakfast of an attribute set even at this early date.

But does she have a hat? – “It is concerning to watch the drip-drip-drip of the story, with the ‘it’s nonsense’ response from the campaign.

CANDIDATES SWARM IOWA FAIR Political junkies, loosen your belts! On today’s docket, former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., has the stage to himself today at the Iowa State Fair as the only presidential candidate on the soapbox. Amid the hay bales that heard Mitt Romney declare“corporations are people,” Bush will look to win over Evangelicals who still are not too keen on him. Jeb lost 40lbs recently on the paleo diet so he may have some wiggle room on the calorie front, but his need to address Iowans’ concerns over his conservative creds remains a challenge. Some 20 presidential candidates are slated to make pitches over the course of the fair. On Saturday, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., former Gov. Lincoln Chafee, D-R.I., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., take to the soapbox. Sunday will bring Ben Carson, and former Gov. George Pataki, R-N.Y., to the stage. Look out for other candidates milling about the grounds taking a look at how voters in the first caucus state are ranking their deep-fried politicking. [Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are expected to be at the Iowa State Fairgrounds Saturday, though neither is on the speakers’ schedule.] Trump hires hands - WaPo: “The groundwork laid by Trump’s sizable Iowa staff, with 10 paid operatives and growing, is the clearest sign yet that the unconventional candidate is looking beyond his summer media surge and attempting to win February’s first-in-the-nation caucuses….‘I see them as a major threat to all the other campaigns because of the aggressiveness of their ground game,’ said Sam Clovis, an Iowa conservative who leads former Texas governor Rick Perry’s campaign. ‘You cannot swing a dead cat in Iowa and not hit a Trump person,’ Clovis continued. ‘It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.’” Sounds like Hillary’s campaign and the press - “After much cajoling and corralling – and a little rump-slapping – Big Mac finally bolted into the weighing chute, prompting one of his handlers to sprint to shut the front gate…” – The Des Moines Register reporting on the Trump-backing prize boar of the fair. Jeb says brother’s Iraq ‘mission was accomplished’ - Bloomberg: “Speaking at a national security forum in Davenport, Iowa, on Thursday, the Republican presidential candidate acknowledged that his brother's record on prosecuting the war and its aftermath wasn’t perfect as he tried to balance his own outlook and reconcile the implicit connection he has to some of his brother’s unpopular decisions. ‘I think people have every right to be critical of decisions that were made,’ the former Florida governor said. ‘In 2009, Iraq was fragile, but secure.’ The ‘mission was accomplished’ when it came to Iraq’s security at the end of his brother’s time in the White House,’ Bush said.” Rubio bashes Obama’s Cuba reset, Iran deal - With Secretary of State John Kerry in Havana today to raise the American flag over the U.S. embassy and the president pressing Congress to approve his Iran nukes deal, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., warns Obama’s diplomacy with dictators threatens America’s safety, security. New in Fox News Opinion: “These two dangerous developments represent the convergence of nearly every flawed strategic, moral, and economic notion that has driven President Obama’s foreign policy, and as such are emblematic of so many of the crises he has worsened around the world.” [As part of a speech in New York today detailing his policy on Cuba and Iran, Rubio says he’ll invite political dissidents of repressive government to his inauguration.] Walker plans policy rollout - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Coming off a routine debate performance and a dip in the polls, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says he soon will begin unveiling policy positions on health care, national security and other issues expected to play major roles in the 2016 presidential race….‘We’ll be laying the specifics out in hopes that in the next debate, we talk about that, as opposed to just talking about attacks on any of the candidates,’ Walker said.” [Walker’s campaign is keeping an eye on the SEC Primary as well, signing on more Georgia backers.] POWER PLAY: NEW HAMPSHIRE IS WHERE IT’S AT Take the likes of Trump, Bush, Kasich, et al., add the quirky nature of first in the nation primary voters, and New Hampshire is shaping up to be a raucous battleground.

GRODY, DUDES Reuters: “Three men hoping to find valuables in New York City’s extensive sewer system were facing criminal charges for climbing through a manhole cover and spending several hours on a treasure hunt in the muck-filled caverns, authorities said on Friday. A spokesman for the New York City Police Department said Marquise Evans, 21, dislodged a manhole cover on a street in Brooklyn late on Wednesday and allowed two other men to climb inside. Witnesses called police, and responding officers and firefighters, outfitted in protective garb, followed the men but could not locate the pair, the spokesman said. About four hours later, the two men, identified as David Hannibal, 45, and Damion Nieves, 35, emerged and were taken into custody, police said.” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"So if the Clinton denial is to be believed, individuals in her inner circle would have simply typed or scanned classified information into a non-classified system without regard for its contents. In this case, emails would have started in, and stayed in, the unclassified system -- albeit improperly, based on the findings of the intelligence inspector general.","2071","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/31/did-clinton-emails-jump-from-classified-to-unclassified-system.html"

"A government employee doing so would commit numerous felonies, according to Bradford Higgins, who served as assistant secretary of state for resource management and chief financial officer from 2006-2009.

"The State Department has indicated it sees no evidence of this criminal scenario. Classified documents are supposed to be marked, and State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters at an Aug. 13 briefing ""we have no indications"" any classification markings were stripped. Clinton's defense has been that the emails in question were later deemed classified, after they traversed her server.","2074","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/31/did-clinton-emails-jump-from-classified-to-unclassified-system.html"

"I. Charles McCullough, III, inspector general of the intelligence community, and Steve Linick, inspector general for the Department of State, said in a July 24 statement that of 40 emails the State Department allowed them to review in an audit, four contained intelligence community-derived information that remains classified today.

"One of the emails that sparked the FBI probe was sent in April 2011 from Clinton aide Huma Abedin and covered intelligence from three agencies, Fox News first reported. Other emails that contained classified information came from diplomats with confidential material, according to the AP.","2085","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/31/did-clinton-emails-jump-from-classified-to-unclassified-system.html"
"Pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record, which maintained Clinton's use of personal email followed the precedent of other secretaries of state and she did not violate any laws, said in a recent statement that government agencies often classify information differently from each other and that ""government agencies also are notorious for over-classifying material.""","2086","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/31/did-clinton-emails-jump-from-classified-to-unclassified-system.html"

"Clinton and her staff may have had the ability to use thumb drives, but that would be unusual at the State Department, and it also defeats the purpose of a top secret computer, a classified printer, or what's known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), Higgins said.","2089","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/31/did-clinton-emails-jump-from-classified-to-unclassified-system.html"

"Higgins noted other differences in how classified and non-classified systems are handled. ""At State, your classified hard drive sits in your safe and only comes out for occasional use and must be returned to the safe before you leave at night,"" he said.

"Hillary’s move to the left is more revealing when viewed in the context of what’s happened to the Democratic Party since her husband beat George H.W. Bush. And the simple fact is the party’s center of gravity has moved in a sharply liberal direction, just as the Republicans have become more conservative since Bush’s son was in the White House.","2112","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/04/hillary-is-moving-left-but-isnt-divorcing-bill-politically-speaking.html"
"The most obvious example is same-sex marriage. It was Bill Clinton who signed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, at a time when the Democrats were widely viewed as too liberal on cultural issues. Hillary has not only embraced gay marriage, she’s suddenly come out for a constitutional amendment to allow such unions, rather than leaving the matter to the states.","2113","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/04/hillary-is-moving-left-but-isnt-divorcing-bill-politically-speaking.html"
"But Bill Clinton has also renounced DOMA. And with gay marriage legal in 37 states and public opinion swinging sharply in that direction, Hillary Clinton would be out of step with her own party if she took any other position.

"Criminal justice is another battleground. It was the former president’s policies that led to militarizing local police departments and the incarceration of 2 million people, which even he now says was an overreaction to the crime wave of that time. Hillary is now calling for an end to “the era of incarceration,” which even some conservatives believe has gone too far. But again, no daylight between her and her spouse.","2115","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/04/hillary-is-moving-left-but-isnt-divorcing-bill-politically-speaking.html"
"A trickier obstacle course for Hillary is trade. Much of the Democratic Party is opposed to President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is the natural successor to Bill Clinton’s NAFTA agreement. But on this one, Hillary has been cautious, issuing platitudes about the need to protect workers rather than opposing the president she worked for.

"That calamity of a press conference on Tuesday has opened the floodgates of criticism, and even many of the liberal commentators who might be expected to support her are throwing up their hands. She is being legalistic and defensive and not ceding a centimeter.","2131","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/20/hillarys-testy-email-defense-why-mainstream-media-arent-buying-it.html"
"It’s a bit much to say that the press has turned on Hillary, since relations between the two camps have always been tense.

"The press, of course, tends to run in a pack. With Clinton’s poll numbers slipping and her server under FBI investigation, some accounts suggest that her campaign ship could be in danger of capsizing.

"As for the handling of the email fiasco, “the appearance here -- even if Clinton did nothing wrong (and there is no proof she did at this point) -- is terrible.

"“Unlike in 2007, when her events in Iowa were long on bombast and utterly impersonal, she has gamely undertaken a more intimate kind of voter contact this time around…Clinton’s itineraries on her frequent trips to Iowa this year have revolved around town hall meetings, small group events, roundtables, and private house parties.

"Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton on Monday took a giant step toward letting Democratic voters know she’s representing the progressive agenda, calling for tax increases and more regulation on Wall Street -- while making a play for a liberal base that has been gravitating toward Sen. Bernie Sanders.","Published July 13, 2015","2204","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/clinton-economic-address.html"
"“I know as much as anybody, the role Wall Street should play for main street,” said Clinton, who vowed, if elected, to “rein in excessive risks” and appoint regulators to “prosecute firms and individuals” who break the law.","2205","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/clinton-economic-address.html"
"Clinton also vowed to increase taxes on large corporations and the country’s highest wage-earners, an apparent effort to recapture her party’s progressive base now captivated by surging primary challenger Sanders and the reformer agenda of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is not a 2016 candidate.","2206","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/13/clinton-economic-address.html"

"Her biggest crowd, of 5,500 people, was for her New York City kick-off rally. She hasn't matched that number since, drawing an estimated 1,800 to a Virginia fundraiser in June.

"“I hardly see any liberal enthusiasm for [Clinton], and they are concerned she could even drag down the entire ticket,” charged Richard Viguerie, longtime conservative media strategist, who blames the energy lag on Clinton’s political “baggage” and her demeanor, which he claims has never been “warm and fuzzy.”","2418","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"
"Michael Cohen, a Boston Globe columnist, disagrees, calling the “enthusiasm gap” a creation of media boredom during the dog days of summer. “I don’t think it much matters what is happening in August,” he told FoxNews.com. “I think it’s hard for anyone to get excited about politics right now. All of a sudden people are saying she is in trouble and I just don’t see any evidence of that.”","2419","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"

"On Sept. 27, 2007, Obama set a record for that early stage of the Democratic primary, filling Washington Square Park in New York City with an estimated 24,000 people.

"But despite her sharp comparisons of Republicans to extremists on women’s issues – a battle cry to the liberal flank – Sanders appears to be getting more visible adulation from college-age crowds. Not that all his rallies have been ‘full Bern.’ In a recent swing through South Carolina, Sanders faced the stiffer task of appealing to black voters who typically weigh in heavy for Clinton. According to Politico, he drew an estimated crowd of 2,800 in Greenville, and around 3,150 for his Aug. 22 rally in North Charleston. The College of Charleston, however, still covered his speech as though it were a major campus event.","2428","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-enthusiasm.html"

"Beyond paying for salaries and space, her campaign purchased lists of voters in four early primary states, paid six figures to a super PAC devoted to defending her record and spent heavily on building a digital team, according to campaign finance documents filed Wednesday with federal regulators.","2531","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/hillary-clinton-spends-18-million-hires-hundreds.html"

"The outlay is nearly four times what Clinton spent in the first three months of her last presidential campaign, when she faced a far more competitive primary race against then-Sen. Barack Obama.","2533","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/hillary-clinton-spends-18-million-hires-hundreds.html"

"During the first three months of her 2008 bid, Clinton spent 14 percent of the $36 million she raised, according to FEC documents. In the launch of this campaign, she's burned though nearly 40 percent of what she has taken in.","2538","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/hillary-clinton-spends-18-million-hires-hundreds.html"

"By comparison, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has fueled an insurgent challenge to Clinton with small donations. He pulled in more than $15.2 million through the end of June, and three-quarters of his donations were $200 or less.","2540","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/hillary-clinton-spends-18-million-hires-hundreds.html"

"Some of the donors included Clinton's most ardent financial backers, including Hollywood media mogul Haim Saban; Susie Tompkins Buell, a wealthy California investor who was a major donor to the Ready for Hillary super PAC; Las Vegas publisher Brian Greenspun, a longtime friend and college classmate of Bill Clinton; billionaire J.B. Pritzker of Chicago; and Alan Patricof, a New York-based financier who served as Clinton's finance chair when she first ran for Senate in New York.","2542","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/hillary-clinton-spends-18-million-hires-hundreds.html"

"Rubio offered a palpable sense of optimism for the future, returning to his line that America’s greatest days lie ahead. He argued that his tax plan is the only one on offer that’s pro-family.

"For his part, Ted Cruz spoke of how important it is to support single mothers in America and used the example of many single moms in his own family. He was the first to call out Democratic policies as being bad for women, citing that there are now over 3 million women living in poverty. His point was so good that even Fiorina agreed with him. And, when he turned on the CNBC moderators, the audience cheered.","2590","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/hillary-clinton-won-third-gop-debate-heres-why.html"

"In the latest CBS/New York Times poll, 60 percent of Americans said that they wanted to see an outsider in office. And although Cruz has marketed himself as an outsider in the Senate, there are no bigger outsiders in this race than Donald Trump and Ben Carson.","2592","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/hillary-clinton-won-third-gop-debate-heres-why.html"

"To be sure, neither candidate performed badly. Trump had some great lines -- as we expected him to have -- and he was particularly strong in discussing his record of creating jobs. If we want to cut the size of government, as Republicans desire, then he has the greatest case for why he can deliver on jobs for Americans.","2594","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/hillary-clinton-won-third-gop-debate-heres-why.html"
"Ben Carson battled through tough questions on his tax plan where he didn’t come off as particularly confident, but muddled through. He defended his views on gay marriage in such a way that will satisfy the GOP base and, crucially, he continued to emphasize how important it is to get government out of the lives of average Americans.","2595","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/hillary-clinton-won-third-gop-debate-heres-why.html"
"Indeed, getting government out of the lives of Americans was the underlying theme of the debate. Each candidate made mention of it at least once with Carly Fiorina – the first and only candidate to mention “crony capitalism” – offering that we need to get power out of the hands of the big and powerful in order to give it to the small and powerless.","2596","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/hillary-clinton-won-third-gop-debate-heres-why.html"
"Jeb Bush had perhaps the most disappointing performance of the evening. He needed to do well on Thursday night, but he telegraphed his attacks on Rubio -- and Rubio was more than ready.

And he didn’t.","2597","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/hillary-clinton-won-third-gop-debate-heres-why.html"
"John Kasich inserted himself into the conversation. He led by defending Medicare and calling out the candidates for attacking seniors. He touted his record in Ohio of turning an $8 billion deficit into a $2 billion surplus and pointed out that he’s the only candidate who has balanced a budget. But Trump tore him apart, quipping that Kasich “got lucky with fracking” and worked at Lehman Brothers when the bank crippled the world’s economy. Kasich didn’t recover well from that.","2598","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/hillary-clinton-won-third-gop-debate-heres-why.html"
"The upshot is that I don’t expect the polls to move much. We’re looking at a Republican electorate that wants outsiders and that isn’t going to change anytime soon.","2599","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/hillary-clinton-won-third-gop-debate-heres-why.html"
"Furthermore, the divisions in the Republican party remain strong and obvious. This is not a field that I expect to get that much smaller anytime soon.","2600","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/hillary-clinton-won-third-gop-debate-heres-why.html"

"At long last, Hillary Clinton testifies on the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and her emails as secretary of state. Here are some suggested questions. Although these suggestions are based on the public record, we need to assume that the members of the House Benghazi Committee have seen far more than the public has.

"The theory of cross-examination -- particularly of a high-profile, intelligent, belligerent or ruthless witness -- is for the questioner to tell a story by asking questions that suggest answers that challenge the witness’s version of events or impeach the witness’s credibility.

"She who has ripped into Republicans for seeking political gain from the four American deaths in Benghazi, Libya, now seeks her own political gain from the dozens of murdered children and young adults in Newtown, Connecticut, and Roseburg. On the heels of the latter and referring to both tragedies, she launched an emotional attack early this week on the two most recent Supreme Court decisions upholding the personal right to keep and bear arms. She offered to “fix” them should she be elected president.","2642","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/hillary-clinton-and-your-right-to-self-defense.html"
"Her so-called fix consists of a dead-on-arrival legislative proposal making gun manufacturers financially liable for the misuse of their products and an executive order determining the meaning of certain words used in federal statutes.","2643","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/hillary-clinton-and-your-right-to-self-defense.html"
"The liability-shifting proposal is akin to punishing General Motors whenever a drunken driver misuses his Chevy and injures someone. The courts would surely reject that.","2644","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/hillary-clinton-and-your-right-to-self-defense.html"
"The executive order proposal assaults the Constitution. Those in the gun sale business must conduct background checks via computer services offered by the FBI. The background checks look for reports of crimes of violence, domestic violence and mental illness. Private people who occasionally sell their hardware or give guns as gifts are exempt from conducting background checks. Clinton would create a presidentially written and mandated definition of occasional sales and gifts so as to require background checks for all gun transfers -- a requirement Congress rejected.","2645","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/hillary-clinton-and-your-right-to-self-defense.html"

"As a lawyer, Clinton should know that only the federal courts -- not the president -- can decide what statutory language means. Moreover, if she knew anything about FBI background checks, she would know that they are only as good as the database on which they rely.

"Yet if she were to become president, she would take an oath to uphold the Constitution; that means the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court.

"What did both the Newtown and the Roseburg tragedies have in common? Both murderers were madmen. Yet neither had a record of mental illness, so the background checks the anti-self-defense lobby loves would not have prevented either of these killers from buying a gun and using it to murder indiscriminately. If killers are prepared to murder innocent children, does Clinton really think they would obey the laws regulating gun ownership?","2651","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/hillary-clinton-and-your-right-to-self-defense.html"
"Both mass murders occurred in no-gun zones. A no-gun zone is the most dangerous place on the planet when a madman intent on killing enters. No-gun zones are arbitrarily designated on public property by local authorities, stripping law-abiding folks of their lawfully owned guns -- their natural right to self-defense -- and exposing them to terror and death.","2652","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/hillary-clinton-and-your-right-to-self-defense.html"
"The Constitution does not permit public no-gun zones any more than it does public no-free-speech zones. If the right to keep and bear arms is truly fundamental, the government cannot interfere with it based on geography. If the Army veteran/college student who stopped seven bullets with his body last week and saved the lives of his classmates (and survived!) had been permitted to carry a gun into the school building, the madman who murdered nine innocents would have been stopped long before police arrived -- long before he completed his killings.","2653","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/hillary-clinton-and-your-right-to-self-defense.html"
"The right to keep and bear arms has more than just the Second Amendment to protect it. By characterizing the right as fundamental and pre-political, the high court accepted the truism that this right is merely a modern extension of the ancient right to self-defense. And the right to defend oneself does not come from the government; it comes from our humanity. It is a natural right.","2654","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/hillary-clinton-and-your-right-to-self-defense.html"
"Who among us, when confronted with the terror of nearly certain annihilation, would concern himself with the niceties of the law? Life itself is at stake.

"Obama did his best to avoid constitutional norms. He deployed American intelligence agents on the ground, not troops, so he could plausibly deny he had put “boots” on the ground. He did not seek an American national consensus for war because Libya presented no threat whatsoever to the U.S. He did not obtain a congressional declaration of war as the Constitution requires because he couldn’t get one. And he did not seek United Nations permission, which is required to attack a fellow U.N. member.","2663","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/cannot-allow-hillary-clinton-midwife-to-chaos-and-public-liar-to-be-our-next-president.html"
"He did obtain a U.N. embargo of the shipment of weapons into Libya, and he secured a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over portions of Libya. In order to enforce the no-fly zone, NATO sent jet fighters over the skies of Libya. The jets were guided and directed by American intelligence agents on the ground to bomb Libyan planes on the ground, which had been paid for by American taxpayers.","2664","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/cannot-allow-hillary-clinton-midwife-to-chaos-and-public-liar-to-be-our-next-president.html"
"To pursue her goal of a “democratic” government there, Clinton, along with Obama and a dozen or so members of Congress from both houses and both political parties, decided she should break the law by permitting U.S. arms dealers to violate the U.N. arms embargo and arm Libyan rebels whom she hoped would one day run the new government. So she exercised her authority as secretary of state to authorize the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood and friendly to the Libyan rebels and a country the U.S. had no business arming -- unless the purpose of doing so was for the arms to be transferred to the rebels.","2665","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/cannot-allow-hillary-clinton-midwife-to-chaos-and-public-liar-to-be-our-next-president.html"
"Once this plot was hatched, Clinton and her fellow conspirators realized that some of these rebel groups were manned by al-Qaida operatives; and selling or providing arms to them is a felony -- hence the reason for months' worth of missing and destroyed Clinton emails.

"Flash-forward to Clinton’s public testimony before the House Benghazi Committee last week. Clinton had three audiences to address. Her immediate audience was the committee, whose members generally did not know how to ask questions of a witness trying to hide the truth. Her second audience was the American people, who will recall little more than 15-second sound bites and general impressions of her testimony. Her third (unseen) audience consisted of the FBI agents and federal prosecutors who are investigating her.","2667","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/cannot-allow-hillary-clinton-midwife-to-chaos-and-public-liar-to-be-our-next-president.html"
"That audience was looking for perjury, misleading statements and what federal law calls “bad acts.” Perjury is lying under oath. Misleading Congress is criminal and consists of testimony that employs deceptive language so as to create an untruthful impression. Bad acts constitute repeated behavior demonstrating moral turpitude -- usually a pattern of deception.","2668","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/cannot-allow-hillary-clinton-midwife-to-chaos-and-public-liar-to-be-our-next-president.html"
"The FBI agents surely heard Clinton mislead Congress when she answered a hard question about arms going to rebels by saying “I think the answer is no” and again when she answered a question about arming private militias by saying it may have been considered but wasn't “seriously” considered. And they heard her directly commit perjury when she was asked whether she knew about our country's supplying arms to Libyan rebels directly or indirectly and she answered, “No.”","2669","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/cannot-allow-hillary-clinton-midwife-to-chaos-and-public-liar-to-be-our-next-president.html"

The FBI and CIA advised her -- in documents that are now public -- that U.S. arms were making their way to known al-Qaida operatives. How could she answer ""no""?

"Then the cover-up began. At the same time Clinton was telling her daughter and the Egyptian prime minister within hours of Stevens’ death that al-Qaida killed him and after the CIA told her the plot to kill Stevens had been hatched 12 days earlier, she told the public that Stevens was killed by spontaneous demonstrators angered about a cheap anti-Islam video, the producer of which she vowed to “get.” She later angrily dismissed questions over this cover-up by arguing, “What difference, at this point, does it make?”","2671","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/cannot-allow-hillary-clinton-midwife-to-chaos-and-public-liar-to-be-our-next-president.html"

"The failure to preserve data of that nature is a federal crime, whether it is stamped with an official secret denomination, whether one has read it and perceived its secret nature, and whether it has fallen into enemy hands or not. Gen. David Petraeus was convicted of retaining the printed versions of secret and top-secret data in a desk drawer in his guarded home.

"She is unhappy because she got caught in a scheme of her own creation. I suspect she is about to become even less happy when evidence of why she did this comes to light. I suspect that evidence will soon be made known that will demonstrate conclusively that she and her aides were part of a criminal conspiracy to enrich the Clinton Foundation by unlawful means -- including moving levers of governmental power -- and thus enrich her and her husband.

"Just as she hoped to reboot her campaign to reveal her more humorous and frolicsome self, Hillary Clinton is poleaxed by the startling development that her server may not, after all, have been wiped clean. Platte River Networks, the firm that has managed the computer system used by Mrs. Clinton and some family members since 2013, has affirmed that no electronic erasing of Mrs. Clinton’s personal emails was carried out. Those emails, then, are presumably available for public scrutiny. Thus begins a new chapter in Hillary’s battle to keep private those communications that might damage her reputation and campaign.","Published September 14, 2015","2719","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/14/warmer-spontaneous-hillary-clinton-still-cant-dodge-private-email-scandal.html"
"At issue are some thirty thousand emails that Mrs. Clinton unilaterally deemed “personal” and then deleted.

"That claim was debunked when the House committee investigating Benghazi discovered communications that had been sent to Mrs. Clinton by long-time aide Sydney Blumenthal, which touched on events in Libya. That those emails were not included in the work-related records sent to the State Department by Mrs. Clinton has cast doubts on her truthfulness, and on what else she might have chosen not to include for the public record.","2721","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/14/warmer-spontaneous-hillary-clinton-still-cant-dodge-private-email-scandal.html"
"In a legal showdown between Judicial Watch and the government, the Justice Department asserted just recently that Mrs. Clinton had the right to erase personal emails. Judicial Watch has asked for a court order that would guarantee preservation of Clinton's emails. Though the government has (not surprisingly) stood up for Mrs. Clinton, the claim misses the point. The question is not whether Hillary was within her rights to delete personal emails; the issue is whether she also deleted communications having to do with her role as secretary of state that might have become, shall we say, inconvenient.","2722","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/14/warmer-spontaneous-hillary-clinton-still-cant-dodge-private-email-scandal.html"
"Now, in addition to the steady drip-drip of emails being issued monthly from the State Department, helping to keep the issue on the front page, Hillary’s campaign will also have to mount a legal battle to keep those 30,000 deleted “personal” emails out of view. That will be ugly, reinforcing the secretiveness and underhandedness so many associate with the former first lady.","2723","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/14/warmer-spontaneous-hillary-clinton-still-cant-dodge-private-email-scandal.html"
"It will also undermine the recent reboot of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.

"Appearing recently on the “Ellen DeGeneres Show,” Hillary offered up her best campaign line so far. When asked what her granddaughter called her, Mrs. Clinton noted that one-year-old Charlotte didn’t have many words as yet, but said, ""Well, you know I'm fine with 'Grandma,' I'm fine with 'Madame President' — I mean, whatever."" Clever, right? Except that the quip was almost surely staged. By their first birthday, most babies babble and have set names for important figures in their lives, like “mama” and “dada”, and also “gramma.” Most likely Charlotte does, too. But, the line was a good one, even if phony. Which it probably was.","2726","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/14/warmer-spontaneous-hillary-clinton-still-cant-dodge-private-email-scandal.html"
"One reason voters see Mrs. Clinton as inauthentic, is that she is inauthentic. She has much to be inauthentic about – her efforts to expunge possibly troublesome emails, the unseemly and possibly criminal activities of the Clinton Foundation, her purposeful deception about the causes of the Benghazi disaster, her middling performance as secretary of state (note: Russia “reset”), the numerous past scandals that have dogged her for decades.","2727","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/14/warmer-spontaneous-hillary-clinton-still-cant-dodge-private-email-scandal.html"
"It is hard for Hillary to shake off these challenges and reboot. Especially when her campaign staff for reasons unknown broadcasts the campaign makeover aka “reset” plan to the New York Times. The tip undermined the relaunch as pundits across the country mocked her carefully crafted attempts to become more spontaneous and likeable. That’s like John Harbaugh announcing a new offense strategy against the New England Patriots, the day before the Ravens take to the field. In a word, self-defeating.","2728","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/14/warmer-spontaneous-hillary-clinton-still-cant-dodge-private-email-scandal.html"
"Not for the first time do we wonder if there is a mole in the Clinton camp. When your strategists worry publicly that your game plan isn’t working, that your backers are alarmed, that “previous attempts to introduce Mrs. Clinton’s softer side to voters have backfired amid criticism that the efforts seemed overly poll tested,” they are not helping your cause. Nor is it helpful to publicize that it was a focus group in New Hampshire that finally drove Mrs. Clinton to apologize for her email problems, rather than her own instincts.","2729","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/14/warmer-spontaneous-hillary-clinton-still-cant-dodge-private-email-scandal.html"
"The harsh truth is that Hillary has no political instincts. The Times reports that “the coming months will also be a period of trying to shed her scriptedness” – a word surely coined for Mrs. Clinton. A natural politician (like her husband) would have known better than to stalk off from a news conference, complaining that it was only the media that cared about her emails. A natural campaigner would never have allowed reporters to be roped off, or alienated early on by snide remarks and derision. Those were not just stupid mistakes, they were costly.","2730","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/14/warmer-spontaneous-hillary-clinton-still-cant-dodge-private-email-scandal.html"

"So why support the false narrative at the start? Because the Obama administration had an election to win eight weeks later, and a terrorist attack that killed four Americans didn't fit into that plan. President Obama asked voters to reelect him because he had killed Usama bin Laden. Al Qaeda was on the ropes. Qaddafi was dead and the Libyan war a success. The wave of war was a receding. President George W. Bush's War on Terror was over because Obama and Clinton had won it. A terrorist attack that killed Americans at Benghazi did not fit into that campaign narrative, so it had to be retold and spun into a different story. It wasn't radical Islamist terrorists, but a spontaneous demonstration that got out of control in reaction to an obscure Internet video. In the end, the Benghazi hearings probably didn't change many minds.","2766","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/23/hillary-clinton-gave-us-glimpse-her-soul-at-benghazi-hearings-and-it-was-chilling.html"

"The FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email has now expanded to include obtaining data from a second tech company, which is fully cooperating with the FBI probe that has threatened Clinton’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Fox News has learned.","Published October 07, 2015","2775","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"
"A source familiar with the investigation told Fox that the FBI contacted Connecticut-based Datto, Inc. in September and asked them to preserve all data they had which may be connected to Clinton. Datto was hired to help back up data in May 2013 by Platte River Networks, the Colorado-based tech company that managed Clinton’s server and has already been cooperating with the FBI investigation.","2776","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"
"The cooperation of a second tech company raises new questions about whether the FBI is now obtaining any of the emails that Clinton says she and her attorneys deemed to be personal and deleted, as Republican critics have demanded to know if any of those emails were really work-related emails that should have been turned over to the State Department along with other federal records.","2777","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"
"Datto's cooperation also raises more questions about whether anyone at the company, where employees do not have security clearances, had access to classified information that was in Clinton’s server. The source familiar with the investigation said that like all major tech companies on the front lines, Datto has faced cyberattacks, another subject of great interest to the FBI in its probe of Clinton’s server.","2778","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"
"The FBI investigation gathered new steam this past Friday when officials at Datto received written consent from both Platte River and Clinton’s camp to turn over relevant data to the FBI, a process that is now underway as Clinton struggles in the polls just days before the first Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas.","2779","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"
"However, the source familiar with the investigation stressed it’s not clear whether Datto has in its possession all of Clinton’s personal and officials created while she was Secretary of State -- or new emails or other data created after she left office.","2780","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"
"The confusion comes from the fact that Datto was hired by Platte River and not the Clinton team, so the company had no idea it was backing up data for Clinton until August of this year when company officials read news reports about Platte River having the high-profile contract.","2781","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"
"Once Datto officials realized this summer that they had been backing up some of Clinton’s data which was now the subject of an FBI probe, one company official recalled, “there was a collective lump in our throats” and they sought to cooperate fully.","2782","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"

"In August, Johnson wrote, an employee at Platte River voiced suspicions over searching for an email from Clinton Executive Service Corp. directing such a reduction in data being stored in October or November 2014 and then again around February, advising Platte River to save only emails sent during the most recent 30 days.","2785","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"

"Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon fired back at Johnson's efforts on Wednesday, saying in a statement that the senator is ""ripping a page from the House Benghazi Committee's playbook and mounting his own, taxpayer-funded sham of an investigation with the sole purpose of attacking Hillary Clinton politically."" He said the Justice Department is ""fully aware of Datto's role"" in providing services to Platte.","2788","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"

"The source familiar with the investigation stressed there was no conversation between employees of Datto and Platte River about covering up any data. Though the source noted that this summer Platte River employees were “surprised” to learn that the Clinton data was being backed up in an offsite cloud, which wasa more extensive backup than Platte River officials had anticipated. As a result, officials at Datto took steps in August to make sure the Clinton data was being preserved because they did not want to run into a legal problem.","2790","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/fbi-probe-hillary-clinton-emails-expands-to-second-tech-company.html"

"Fass added in the emailed statement late Tuesday, “Also, we received a letter from the Senate Homeland Security Committee and Government Affairs Committee just last night and we are in the process of responding to it. Datto is a data protection and business continuity company that provides backup data storage to thousands of Managed Service Providers, including Platte River Networks.

"Honestly, Hillary shape shifts between describing herself as a progressive and a moderate depending on who she thinks she needs to pander to on a given day. For example, at a Women for Hillary event in Ohio last month, Clinton said, ""You know, I get accused of being kind of moderate and center. I plead guilty."" Yet in the recent Democratic debate and in a previous campaign stop in New Hampshire, Clinton averred, “I take a backseat to no one when you look at my record in standing up and fighting for progressive values.”","2799","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/17/hillarys-big-debate-lie.html"

"· When she was first lady, her husband, Bill, tasked her with health care reform. She proceeded to run her task force in secret and produce a 1,324-page blueprint that was so riddled with unpopular government mandates, coercion and bureaucracy that even a Democratic-controlled Congress wouldn’t vote on it. The debacle of “Hillarycare” helped lead to the 1994 Republican takeover of both the House and Senate for the first time since the 83rd Congress of 1953-1954.","2804","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/17/hillarys-big-debate-lie.html"
"· In the Huffington Post, here is how columnist Adam Hanft described Clinton’s record as a U.S. senator from New York: “When she talks about ‘sponsoring’ and ‘introducing’ and ‘fighting for’ legislation that obviously hasn't passed, that's a smokescreen for failure. For many of the bills she introduced, she couldn't even get a cosponsor in her own party!” Hanft goes on to give seven examples of Clinton’s inability to muster even a single Democratic cosponsor for her bills (let alone a Republican) on topics like terrorism, crime, health care and energy. Hanft concluded, “It's a track record of legislative failure and futility.”","2805","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/17/hillarys-big-debate-lie.html"
"· As secretary of state, Clinton took charge of a series of “resets” that proved to be upsets with catastrophic consequences. There was the “Russian reset” that “began with the Obama administration’s reneging on a pre-existing American commitment to supply defensive technology to shield Poland and the Czech Republic from missile attacks [which] left both countries vulnerable to pressures and threats from Russia” and continued with Russia’s bloody annexation of Crimea. Under Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, there were interventionist “resets” in Egypt and Libya that “led to Islamic extremists’ taking over in Egypt and terrorist chaos in [Benghazi] Libya, where the American ambassador was killed, along with three other Americans.” Look at Iran, Syria, China, North Korea and at our ally, Israel—indeed, look anywhere worldwide. Name one instance of Clinton accomplishing anything of significance to mitigate the spread of terrorism, stop the slaughter of Christians and Jews, and make America safer.","2806","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/17/hillarys-big-debate-lie.html"
"Speaking of her deleted emails and private server when she was secretary of state, Clinton said, “I’ve gone longer and farther to try to be as transparent as possible. Nobody else has done that.”","2807","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/17/hillarys-big-debate-lie.html"

"But the former first lady has also lost control of the policy debate. She has dragged her feet on two major issues—Keystone pipeline and Pacific trade deal—only to wind up siding with Bernie Sanders. So instead of getting credit for taking a stand, she is portrayed by the press as indecisive and calculating.","2854","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/09/haunting-hillary-why-email-story-is-spinning-out-control.html"

"Forfeiting control of the story line is a huge setback for a candidate. It’s hard to score points when you’re constantly seen as responding to investigators or rivals or media detractors. And the private server represents the classic self-inflicted wound. What would this campaign look like if Hillary had used State Department email like everyone else?","2856","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/09/haunting-hillary-why-email-story-is-spinning-out-control.html"

"Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon fired back at the GOP senator who released that information, saying: “Ron Johnson is ripping a page from the House Benghazi Committee’s playbook and mounting his own, taxpayer-funded sham of an investigation with the sole purpose of attacking Hillary Clinton politically… The Justice Department’s independent review is led by nonpolitical, career professionals, and Ron Johnson has no business interfering with it for his own partisan ends.”","2864","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/09/haunting-hillary-why-email-story-is-spinning-out-control.html"
"The fact that thousands of deleted emails were backed up raises the possibility that they could be recovered by investigators—yet another route over which she’s lost control. And if some of those deleted messages are shown not to involve personal matters, as Clinton has claimed, that would create new credibility problems.","2865","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/09/haunting-hillary-why-email-story-is-spinning-out-control.html"

"For months, Clinton and her allies said the email flap was no big deal, until the candidate finally admitted she had made a mistake and needed to address it.

"“From her adventures in cattle trading to chairing a policymaking committee in her husband's White House to running for Senate in a state she'd never lived in to her effort to use superdelegates to overturn 2008 primary results to her email servers, Clinton is clearly more comfortable than the average person with violating norms and operating in legal gray areas.‎","2868","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/09/haunting-hillary-why-email-story-is-spinning-out-control.html"

"“But it's also an enormous source of potential strength. Committed Democrats and liberal-leaning interest groups are facing a reality in which any policy gains they achieve are going to come through the profligate use of executive authority, and Clinton is almost uniquely suited to deliver the goods. More than almost anyone else around, she knows where the levers of power lie, and she is comfortable pulling them, procedural niceties be damned.”","2870","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/09/haunting-hillary-why-email-story-is-spinning-out-control.html"

Like Nixon, whose handlers successfully fooled a majority of voters by trotting out a “new Nixon” after his election defeats in 1960 and 1962, Hillary Clinton is trying to change her public image with voters, a majority of whom find her “Unlikeable,” to borrow from the title of Ed Klein’s new book.","Published October 08, 2015","2875","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/there-is-no-new-hillary-clinton-just-like-there-was-no-new-nixon.html"

"The biggest step so far in her transformation came last weekend on “Saturday Night Live.” In a sketch featuring Kate McKinnon, the designated Hillary character for this election cycle, the real Hillary appeared as a bartender named “Val.” Reading from cue cards with scripted political and even self-deprecating jokes, the real Hillary presented herself as warm, fuzzy and funny, characteristics heretofore unknown in the former first lady, former New York senator and former secretary of state.","2878","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/there-is-no-new-hillary-clinton-just-like-there-was-no-new-nixon.html"
"In case there was any doubt as to where NBC’s political heart is, the opening segment of the show ridiculed several Republican candidates as mentally ill and in need of pharmaceutical help. Not content with the candidates, “SNL” even mocked Donald Trump’s wife, a former model. McKinnon as “Hillary” said if she’s elected she plans to nail Trump’s hair to the wall in the Oval Office. Yucks all around as the mostly young audience went wild with laughter and applause. I wonder if shows still have the old applause signs to ignite fake spontaneity, which would be appropriate in Hillary’s case.","2879","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/08/there-is-no-new-hillary-clinton-just-like-there-was-no-new-nixon.html"
"During the 1992 campaign when Bill Clinton ran for and won the presidency, CNN was referred to by critics as the “Clinton News Network” for what they perceived to be the cable network’s uncritical boosting of his candidacy and its over-the-top criticism of President George H.W.

"Political junkies are focused on Donald Trump, but Hillary Clinton’s weakness remains a huge story. Her support among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers has dropped to 37%, down 20 points since May, according to an Aug. 26 Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll. Meanwhile, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is up 16 points to 30%, and Vice President Joe Biden, who isn’t even running, is up six points to 14%. The poll caused great consternation among Mrs. Clinton’s supporters, as it should have. Some of her advocates tried to claim that the survey contained good news, in that the former secretary of state’s favorable rating among Democratic caucusgoers remained at 77%. But if Mrs. Clinton’s favorables remained high while she hemorrhaged support, then Iowa Democrats are moving to Mr. Sanders not because they dislike her but because she doesn’t excite them, and they like him more. That too was polled. Only 2% of Mr. Sanders’s backers said that their decision to support him was because they don’t support Mrs. Clinton. But is there a Democrat who—absent something extraordinary, say, Mrs. Clinton’s indictment over mishandling classified information on her private email account—can beat her for the nomination?

"A new survey shows Sen. Bernie Sanders has narrowed Clinton’s lead in Iowa to seven points, down from 34 points.

"1. Prohibiting domestic abusers and stalkers from buying and possessing guns. This sounds reasonable, but the change from existing law would allow people to have their guns taken from them without a court hearing. If people are committing crimes, they should be prosecuted for felonies or misdemeanors, but Clinton’s solution is to take away their guns even when they aren’t being prosecuted.","2904","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/05/why-hillary-clintons-gun-control-plan-is-all-wrong.html"
"2. Closing the “Charleston Loophole,” where the federal background check worker didn’t contact the right law enforcement agencies. But the truth is more complicated. First, even a perfectly functioning background check system very likely wouldn’t have stopped the suspect, Dylann Roof, from getting a gun. Second, the current background check system is a much worse mess than Clinton recognizes.","2905","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/05/why-hillary-clintons-gun-control-plan-is-all-wrong.html"
"Roof allegedly planned his attack for at least six months, so it’s hard to believe he couldn’t have figured out some way to obtain a gun. Indeed, he stole the gun he used in this attack.","2906","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/05/why-hillary-clintons-gun-control-plan-is-all-wrong.html"

"FBI Director James Comey’s comments in July about the FBI’s background check system focus on one type of error, where someone who should have been prohibited from getting a gun wasn’t stopped.

"3. Repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which prevents the manufacturers and dealers of firearms from being held liable for crimes committed with their weapons. It might be hard to remember, but gun makers were being sued because they ""specifically geared"" their weapons to make them attractive to gang members. Among the offending characteristics listed are low price, easy concealability, corrosion resistance and high firepower. Suing an industry for making affordable products shows how far the liability-litigation madness has gone.","2909","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/05/why-hillary-clintons-gun-control-plan-is-all-wrong.html"

"The bad news has continued to cascade onto the Hillary Clinton for President campaign, and none of it has anything to do with Clinton’s opinions on issues. It all is about her fitness for office.","Published September 17, 2015","2913","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"
"Since Labor Day, we have learned that the folks into whose hands Clinton reposed her computer server for safe keeping do not believe it has been wiped clean of all emails, as her lawyer told a federal judge it was. That means the 33,000 emails she thought she destroyed probably still could be recovered. What will they reveal?","2914","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"
"And we learned earlier this week that of the emails released thus far -- those Clinton did not attempt to destroy -- there is a five- month gap for which no emails were produced. For a government official who sent or received about 15,000 emails a year, five months of silence is not believable. Two of those months followed the assassination of the U.S. Ambassador to Libya in Benghazi. Where are her emails from that time period?","2915","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"
"Why should you care about this?","2916","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"
"It is now well established that when she was secretary of state, Clinton refused to use government computers or servers for any of her emails -- governmental and personal. She kept all of her emails from the government. That constitutes theft of government property, as it violates a federal law that mandates that the government owns the emails its employees generate in their work, and if an employee comingles her personal emails with the government’s, the government owns those, as well.","2917","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"
"Clinton said she did this because she believed it would be easier to do all emailing from one hand-held device, even though she eventually used four devices. Instead of accepting a secure government-issued BlackBerry, she had aides buy an off-the-shelf BlackBerry. We now know that she was trying to conceal her Middle Eastern escapades -- secret wars and personal approvals of arms dealings to terrorists -- from the president, from FBI investigators, from State Department colleagues, and from history.","2918","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"
"But her most serious crime is her failure to safeguard national secrets. The secretary of state is the nation’s chief diplomat. She deals with military, diplomatic, and national security secrets every day. One of the reasons government employees are required by law to use a government-issued hand-held device and a government-owned and secured server for their official work is to safeguard the national security secrets that pass to and from them by securing their emails with government software and encryption.","2919","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"

"When she became secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton told the president she wanted to hire her friend Sidney Blumenthal -- whom the press has nicknamed ‘the prince of darkness’ and ‘grassy knoll’ -- to work as her senior adviser. The president himself blocked the toxic Blumenthal from working for the State Department, whereupon Clinton had her husband’s foundation hire him. She then proceeded to engage with him as if he were a senior adviser and to share top secret emails with him. Blumenthal did not have any national security clearance, and it was a felony for Clinton to share government secrets with him.","2921","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"

"Like a crook, she breaks the law, lies about why she broke the law, sees no wrong-doing in her ways, and expects to get away with it. Though millions of Democrats have dreamed of her in the White House, and are apparently willing to overlook her crimes, her support is beginning to erode.","2924","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"
"How can a person with the morals of a crook be the chief law enforcement officer in the land, the commander in chief of the military, and the repository of more lawful power than any person on the planet? How can she be entrusted with national security secrets in the future when she has failed to safeguard them in the past?","2925","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"
"Because Blumenthal lacked the government’s encryption on his email devices and server, he was hacked by foreign agents. Because he was hacked, Clinton was hacked. Because she was hacked, some of the nation’s military, diplomatic, and national security secrets in a dangerous world are now in dangerous hands.","2926","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/17/hillary-chronicles-candidate-with-morals-crook.html"

Two of the emails contained Top Secret/SCI material -- the most highly classified.

"There is a lot of history at play among Obama, Clinton and top Democrats in the Senate when it comes to war in the Middle East. Clinton famously remarked in 2014, after leaving the administration, that “‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not a sufficient organizing principle,” for the nation’s foreign policy.

"Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) also dismissed the Obama administration’s claim that the 50 soldiers are not “ground troops” because their role is to provide technical guidance to rebel troops fighting ISIS.

"The State Department has received an email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gen. David Petraeus that apparently was not included in the collection she said was a full record of her work-related correspondence. In addition, the State Department said it provided more than 900 Libya-related emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi Friday. The Department has had those emails since December. The Clinton-Petraeus messages, according to the Department, were exchanged in January and February of 2009 and included a discussion about personnel. Petraeus was head of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) when Clinton took office in 2009 and then went on to become director of the CIA from 2011-12. Officials said the emails in no way dealt with classified material. But their existence challenges Clinton's claim that she has handed over the entirety of her work emails from the account. “In the last several days, the State Department received from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of US Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department,” said State Department spokesman John Kirby. The revelation adds to the growing questions related to the Democratic presidential front-runner's unusual usage of a private email account and server while in government. Jamal D. Ware, spokesman for the Select Committee on Benghazi, issued a statement Friday in response to the news about the new documents. “The State Department, which has failed to comply with multiple Benghazi Committee requests and failed to act in good faith, is now indicating it intends to foster a more cooperative relationship with the committee. It’s curious the Department is suddenly able to be more productive after recent staff changes involving those responsible for document production.” The State Department has already released more than 13,000 pages of Hillary Clinton emails – not all Benghazi related -- as part of an ongoing Freedom of Information Act process. Clinton has taken heat for having the private email address and a separate server, casting doubt over whether all of her communications relating to the 2012 attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi would be turned over to the committee. Clinton is expected to testify before the Committee investigating the attacks in October.

"In 2008, Clinton’s loss of several union endorsements to Obama, then a first-term senator representing Illinois, proved damaging to her campaign.

"A review of Clinton's public schedule shows March 18, 2011, was indeed a pivotal day during her tenure as secretary of state. Clinton was in Washington, D.C., that day and made three trips to the White House. Brad Blakeman, former adviser to President George W.

"While the offer to engage directly with the U.S. government, and its apparent rejection, were first reported by the late journalist Michael Hastings for Rolling Stone in October 2011, the new emails document that the offer was real – and show it was known at senior levels of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who advise the president. The Washington Times in January 2015 reported a five-part series called ""Hillary's war"" that concluded the Pentagon did not trust Clinton's strategy on Libya. The series included taped conversations between then-Democratic Rep.

"The account appears to stand in contrast with Clinton's autobiography ""Hard Choices,"" which does not mention the March 18 episode.

"South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy’s Special Committee on Benghazi has been now thoroughly outed — not by Democrats but by his fellow Republicans.","3351","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"First House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) bragged that Gowdy’s committee had succeeded in bringing down Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers in her bid for the White House. Then New York House Republican Richard Hanna confirmed the same partisan purpose of Gowdy’s committee: “This may not be politically correct,” he said during a radio interview last week, “but I think there is a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after people and get an individual, Hillary Clinton.","3352","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Gowdy, however, continues to deny the undeniable. He insists that he and his fellow Republicans on the committee — Reps. Susan Brooks (Ind.), Jim Jordan (Ohio), Mike Pompeo (Kan.), Martha Roby, (Ala.) Peter Roskham (Ill.) and Lynn Westmoreland (Ga.) — are focused only on the facts about the 2012 attack and why and how to avoid such a tragedy in the future, and that they have no anti-Clinton political agenda.","3353","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"So let’s see if Gowdy and his fellow Republican colleagues walk the walk, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Let’s see how many questions they ask the former secretary of State in this week’s hearings about what happened, why and how to avoid such future tragedies — and how many of them ask about emails and private servers.","3354","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"To test their attempt to rehabilitate themselves for their past conduct that obviously attempted to exploit a tragedy involving the deaths of four Americans for partisan purposes, let’s see if Gowdy or any of the Republicans on the panel ask the following three questions.","3355","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"1. Secretary Clinton, can you tell us why you appointed the Accountability Review Board, chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering and Adm. Michael Mullen, to investigate the Benghazi tragedy and what was the result of their work?","3356","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Of course, if they ask Clinton this question, they will learn that she gave the board, led by a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Republican President George H.W. Bush and a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, complete independence and access. She committed ahead of time, unlike any prior secretaries before her, to full transparency. And when she published the full report (except for some classified material), she immediately accepted all the board’s recommendations to correct “systemic failures” of the department prior to and during the tragedy, and took responsibility.","3357","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"2. Secretary Clinton, as you know, seven other congressional committees have investigated the Benghazi attack. Is there anything they missed that we should be looking into?","3358","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Of course, if Gowdy and the Republican members ask this question, they will have to try to explain why their committee exists at all (other than the anti-Clinton reason that everyone knows) unless they are willing to criticize other Republican Benghazi committees for not doing an adequate job, such as the Republican-controlled House Armed Services and Intelligence committees, which published extensive reports and findings about Benghazi.","3359","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"3. Secretary Clinton, did your choice to use a single BlackBerry to send out emails during your tenure as secretary of State rather than two, or your decision to store emails on a private server at your home, have any impact whatsoever on the tragic events of what happened at Benghazi and its aftermath?","3360","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Of course, the truthful — and indisputable — answer to this question is: No. Gowdy and his fellow Republicans know this.","3361","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Every single member who asks any question about emails — Gowdy, Brooks, Jordan, Pompeo, Roby, Roskham and Westmoreland — should be asked by the media and all constituents back home who care about wasteful government spending: How can you justify spending almost $5 million of taxpayer money when you have uncovered nothing new, duplicated spending by fellow Republicans, and have spent so much time on a subject having nothing to do with the tragedy at Benghazi?","3362","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"
"Let’s see if any of these Republicans ask any of the above three questions or acknowledge that they have wasted taxpayer dollars in trying to hurt Hillary Clinton politically rather than trying to save American lives who serve at dangerous embassy locations in the future.","3363","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/22/benghazi-will-gowdy-or-any-republicans-on-panel-ask-following-three-questions.html"

"On domestic policy, Clinton has also set herself apart by pledging to go further than Obama on topics dear to the hearts of those in the Democrats’ progressive base.

"""She's trying to placate the left, that's where her largest competition is right now with Bernie Sanders.

"While praising the president for his “historic achievement” and pledging that her plan was a way of defending and building upon Obama’s signature domestic legislation, she nonetheless said she would scrap and replace that tax that targets high-cost employer-sponsored health care plans.","3550","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/07/clinton-distances-herself-from-obama-on-syria-domestic-issues.html"
"Some differences between the two are perhaps more a case of Clinton beating Obama to the punch, rather than a genuine difference in policy.

"Buzz Cut: • Email news wipes Hillary’s second reset • Biden ridin’ high in new poll • Carson drills ‘P.C. culture’ while Trump ducks • ¿Qué? Jeb says multiculturalism ‘wrong approach’ • Oh yeah, then where was his goatee?","3658","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/23/email-news-wipes-hillarys-second-reset.html"
"EMAIL NEWS WIPES HILLARY’S SECOND RESET Hillary Clinton’s furious effort to refocus her struggling campaign on something other than the scandals that have dogged it from the start just ran smack into a brick wall. First, the WaPo reported that Clinton had misrepresented why she turned over emails from her private server. It wasn’t routine records keeping as Clinton claimed, but the discovery of her secret email server more than a year ago that triggered the request for her documents and her eventual compliance. That dropped just as Clinton hit the Des Moines Register for a meeting with editors and she was caught flat-footed. The shambles of her initial claims about her email is nearly complete. Pro tip: When you are busted being shady, don’t be shady in your explanation. Clinton was hoping to get back to her new focus: trying to paint herself as more liberal than the Obama administration (seriously!) as she pushes for a huge increase in refugees from the Syrian civil war and for – quite suddenly – the rejection of a new oil pipeline from Canada. Clinton’s goal is to paint herself as left of Vice President Joe Biden. It’s revealing that Clinton has set her new ideological position in the space between Biden and the Democrats’ version of Ron Paul, Sen. Bernie Sanders. That’s a weird space, dude. And it’s one in which a general election bid would have a cramped launch pad, to say the least. She must really be worried about defeating a historically weak field to torch so many general election votes. Transparent, rapid-fire pandering is usually bad news, but it’s still better than being reduced to legalistic dissembling in front of a gaggle of reporters. Yet there Clinton was, watching the second reset of her second campaign fall apart like cheap shoes in a rainstorm. But her bad day wasn’t over yet. Not by a long shot. Bloomberg was about to report that the FBI probe into Clinton’s handling of secret documents as secretary of state had unlocked the more than 30,000 documents that Clinton in March had declared destroyed. The sounds of heads exploding in Brooklyn could be heard across the land. Remember that Clinton took the brazen step of destroying evidence she said would exonerate her. She claimed she handed over all official emails and destroyed the rest in the interest of her family’s privacy. It would clear her name against allegations of ethical and national security misconduct, but she didn’t want anyone nosing around her and her husband’s emails. It sounded absurd, but hey, if the server was “wiped” or shredded, cooked on high in a microwave for an hour and then dumped into the Marianas Trench, there wasn’t anything that could be done about it. Unless Clinton was foolish enough to have deemed the emails gone when they really weren’t and when the server itself wasn’t in her custody. Which now, it appears, was the case. She was bluffing. As Stephan Dinan reports, though, the FBI isn’t exactly advertising its findings. The agency is refusing even to discuss the investigation with the State Department, which was ordered by a judge to try to collaborate with the Justice Department to determine what might be recovered from Clinton’s email. How, when and if the contents of the once-secret server are made public are all open questions. But, if the emails Clinton said she ordered be destroyed have been recovered and if that discovery is confirmed, the emails can be had by congressional investigators. It goes like this: The first and most immediate threat to Clinton’s campaign and, potentially, her freedom is the possibility of criminal prosecution for knowingly mishandling state secrets. If she is even charged with a crime for her email practices, she’s toast. And if the emails she said would “remain private” reveal any sensitive government business, she’s burnt toast. But even if the emails Clinton wanted destroyed yield no charges for her or her intimates, they will certainly be sought by the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi terror attack. And that’s where the risk of the discovery of something not criminal but politically devastating comes into play. Outside of the real, but still unlikely chance that Clinton would get popped for national security violations, the existential threat to her bid to return to the White House is in her and her husband’s convoluted and ethically dubious moneymaking practices of the past decade. If the committee gets evidence that supports the claims that Clinton did inappropriate favors for patrons while in office, that’s probably a death knell, depending on how gross of a violation. And then there’s the embarrassment factor of what was said by Clinton and her top aides in unguarded conversations. Gulp… BIDEN RIDIN’ HIGH IN NEW POLL A Bloomberg News poll out today shows Vice President Joe Biden in a strong position if he does indeed mount a challenge to his party’s once-inevitable frontrunner. Biden was the pick of 25 percent of Democratic voters, just 8 points behind Clinton, who announced her candidacy nearly six months ago. Biden is one point ahead of left-wing heartthrob Sen. Bernie Sanders. But the worse news for Clinton is the poll also shows Clinton at her lowest favorability rating yet among the general electorate – 38 percent, down 10 points from April – with Biden riding to a new high of 49 percent. Biden is seen more favorably by Democrats, too. Seventy percent said they had a favorable opinion of Clinton compared to 80 percent for Biden. Power Play: Hillary’s boxing out Biden - With all the buzz about a Joe Biden challenge, Hillary Clinton has been launched some preemptive strikes in his direction. What’s behind Hillary’s not so welcome wagon? Chris Stirewalt has the answer, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE.

All release on “Special Report with Bret Baier” 6 p.m. ET] CARSON DRILLS ‘P.C. CULTURE’ WHILE TRUMP DUCKS Ben Carson is riding a wave of new support following his unapologetic refusal to support a hypothetical Muslim candidate for president. Carson, who remained adamant in an interview Tuesday with Megyn Kelly, says he is seeing a surge in contributions. Meanwhile, the candidate Carson is chasing in the polls, Donald Trump, is ducking questions surrounding his own Islamocentric controversy. Appearing on “The Tonight Show,” Trump continued to refuse to respond to questions about whether he still believes President Obama is lying about being American-born. Trump has steadfastly refused to comment on the president’s nativity or whether Obama is a secret Muslim since an audience member in New Hampshire last week declared Obama Islamic and referenced Trump’s onetime status as the leading proponent of a conspiracy theory that the president had covered up the location of his birth. Though Trump in another interview seemed to defend the question as legitimate – or at least the part that relates to Muslims in America “being a problem” – he is so far dodging questions on his own beliefs. This has created a considerable opening for the already surging Carson, who isn’t afraid to tackle the topic, perhaps owing to not toting any birther baggage of his own. While Carson says he is trying to “fix the P.C. culture,” Trump suddenly seems to be trying to abide by it. The frontrunner instead is doing his best to revive old feuds and start new ones in hopes that personality conflicts will overshadow his recent troubles. ¿Qué?: Jeb says multiculturalism ‘wrong approach’ - DMR: “Bush offered a sharp rebuke of the notion of multiculturalism in America during a diner stop [in Iowa]. ‘America has done immigration so much better than other countries because it’s a set of values that people share that defines our national identity, not race or ethnicity or where you come from,’… He added that the ‘assimilation process’ in America has been ‘retarded’ by instances in which immigrant groups have remained isolated from broader communities and emphasized the need for new Americans to learn English. ‘A common language is important. We need to get back to that,’ he said. “We’re creeping toward multiculturalism and that’s the wrong approach.’” [Bush is in Washington today where he and his wife Columba will attend a Mass celebrated by Pope Francis.] Rubio bucks pope on economy - Sen. Marco Rubio said on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that he believes Pope Francis is off-target when it comes to the economy. When he “pronounces himself from the chair of Peter,” the Pope speaks with “incredible authority” on moral issues, Rubio, who is a Catholic, told Baier. “I have a difference in opinion with him on economic models,” Rubio said, “We have the same goal, of providing more prosperity and upward mobility. I just honestly believe free enterprise is a better way of doing it.” Watch here.

But she said she would cancel the dinner as just one step in a new hard line against Beijing…Fiorina identified China, together with Russia and Iran, as aggressors that she would curtail if elected. Obama has dealt meekly with the three nations, Fiorina argued, comparing the trio to misbehaving children. ‘What happens If you let your teenager do bad stuff over and over again, what do they do? Bad stuff,’ she said, drawing a mix of laughter and applause at The Citadel military college in Charleston. ‘Well, it’s true of China and (others).’” [Fiorina officially files for South Carolina Primary ballot as she continues a three day tour of the Palmetto State.] OH YEAH, THEN WHERE WAS HIS GOATEE?

A jury last month convicted Felton in the 10 robberies in the Lehigh Valley, all of which occurred during the fall of 2012. Most of the heists were caught on video, which clearly showed Felton’s face as he wielded a pellet gun. Chief Deputy District Attorney Matthew Falk asked for a long sentence, saying some traumatized clerks are unable to return to work due to Felton’s ‘reign of terror.’” Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

"WASHINGTON – Hillary Clinton's private email server, which stored some 55,000 pages of emails from her time as secretary of state, was the subject of attempted cyberattacks originating in China, South Korea and Germany after she left office in early 2013, according to a congressional document obtained by The Associated Press.","Published October 08, 2015","3691","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/clinton-email-server-reportedly-target-cyberattacks-from-china-south-korea.html"
"While the attempts were apparently blocked by a ""threat monitoring"" product that Clinton's employees connected to her network in October 2013, there was a period of more than three months from June to October 2013 when that protection had not been installed, according to a letter from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. That means her server was possibly vulnerable to cyberattacks during that time.","3692","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/clinton-email-server-reportedly-target-cyberattacks-from-china-south-korea.html"
"Johnson's letter to Victor Nappe, CEO of SECNAP, the company that provided the threat monitoring product, seeks a host of documents relating to the company's work on Clinton's server and the nature of the cyber intrusions detected. Johnson's committee is investigating Clinton's email arrangement.","3693","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/clinton-email-server-reportedly-target-cyberattacks-from-china-south-korea.html"
"Clinton has not said what, if any, firewall or threat protection was used on her email server before June 2013, including the time she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the server was kept in her home in the New York City suburbs.","3694","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/clinton-email-server-reportedly-target-cyberattacks-from-china-south-korea.html"
"A February 2014 email from SECNAP reported that malicious software based in China ""was found running an attack against"" Clinton's server. In total, Senate investigators have found records describing three such attempts linked to China, one based in Germany and one originating in South Korea. The attacks occurred in 2013 and 2014. The letter describes four attacks, but investigators have since found records about a fifth, officials who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly said.","3695","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/clinton-email-server-reportedly-target-cyberattacks-from-china-south-korea.html"
"It was not immediately clear whether the attempted intrusions into Clinton's server were serious espionage threats or the sort of nuisance attacks that hit computer servers the world over. But the new revelations underscore the extent to which any private email server is a target, raising further questions about Clinton's decision to undertake sensitive government business over private email stored on a homemade system.","3696","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/clinton-email-server-reportedly-target-cyberattacks-from-china-south-korea.html"
"Any hackers who got access to her server in 2013 or 2014 could have stolen a trove of sensitive email traffic involving the foreign relations of the United States.

"In June 2013, Johnson's letter says, Platte River hired SECNAP Network Security Corp. to use a product called CloudJacket SMB, which is designed to block network access by ""even the most determined hackers,"" according to company literature. But the product was not up and running until October, according to Johnson's letter, raising questions about how vulnerable Clinton's server was during the interim.","3704","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/clinton-email-server-reportedly-target-cyberattacks-from-china-south-korea.html"

"Regarding the dozens of emails from him, which in many cases were forwarded to her State Department team, Clinton testified: ""He's a friend of mine. He sent me information he thought might be of interest. Some of it was, some of it wasn't, some of it I forwarded to be followed up on. He had no official position in the government. And he was not at all my adviser on Libya.""","3730","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/02/state-department-emails-conflict-with-clintons-benghazi-testimony.html"
"But a newly released email from February 2011 shows Blumenthal advocated for a no-fly zone over Libya, writing, ""U.S. might consider advancing tomorrow.

The email was forwarded by Clinton to her deputy chief of staff Jake Sullivan with the question, ""What do you think of this idea?""","3731","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/02/state-department-emails-conflict-with-clintons-benghazi-testimony.html"
"A second email from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in March 2011 also advocated for a no-fly zone, with Blair stating, ""Please work on the non-fly zone, or the other options I mentioned.

"In another email from March 5, 2012, Clinton appears to use Blumenthal as what is known in intelligence circles as a ""cut out,"" a type of intermediary to gather information, allowing the policymaker plausible deniability. In this case, the emails focused on the increasingly chaotic and fragmenting political landscape in Libya after dictator Muammar Qaddafi was removed from power.","3734","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/02/state-department-emails-conflict-with-clintons-benghazi-testimony.html"
"In the one-page document, Blumenthal writes that Jonathan Powell, a former senior British government adviser to Blair, is ""trying to replicate what we did in Northern Ireland by setting up secret channels between insurgents and government, and then, where appropriate, developing these negotiations."" This type of backchannel discussion helped bring about the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland.","3735","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/02/state-department-emails-conflict-with-clintons-benghazi-testimony.html"
"Clinton responded two hours later. ""I'd like to see Powell when he's in the building,"" with her staff responding, ""Will follow up."" In both instances, Clinton's actions further undercut sworn testimony to the Select Committee that Blumenthal was “not at all my adviser on Libya.”","3736","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/02/state-department-emails-conflict-with-clintons-benghazi-testimony.html"
"Another area of conflict involves security and aid requests. In an exchange with Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., Clinton told the House committee none of the requests for diplomatic security reached her. ""That's over 600 requests,"" Pompeo said. ""You've testified here this morning that you had none of those reach your desk; is that correct also?""","3737","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/02/state-department-emails-conflict-with-clintons-benghazi-testimony.html"

"Yet, the new emails show a request for humanitarian aid sent by the late Ambassador Chris Stevens did reach her desk.

"With the overthrow of Qadaffi, Stevens wrote that the Libyan opposition, known as the TNC, would soon release a statement saying it would ""insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp. addressing the acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes).""","3742","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/02/state-department-emails-conflict-with-clintons-benghazi-testimony.html"

"While the request for humanitarian aid from Stevens did reach her office, during her testimony, Clinton emphasized, ""Chris Stevens communicated regularly with the members of my staff.

He raised security with the security professionals.""","3744","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/02/state-department-emails-conflict-with-clintons-benghazi-testimony.html"
"The emails also further depict Clinton’s treatment of sensitive material.

"The 7,000 pages released Friday leave no doubt that Clinton's personal account mingled information now considered classified with the mundane such as social media requests and the taping of a television period drama.

"And in January that same year, Clinton wrote to an aide, ""I'm addicted to Downton Abbey which runs on Sunday night and reruns on Thursday at 8pmb.

"President Obama, meanwhile, is now under scrutiny after having told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not aware of Clinton's personal account – even though the White House said Friday there are emails between the two, only they will not be available under FOIA requests until after Obama leaves office.","3749","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/02/state-department-emails-conflict-with-clintons-benghazi-testimony.html"

"At this point, between 600 and 700 emails have been identified containing classified information.

"This was a not so veiled attack against Hillary Clinton from Martin O’Malley on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate. It was uttered on a night when her opponents were more direct in their criticism but still did not appear to lay a glove on her.","3755","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"Indeed, O’Malley’s words are poignant, but ultimately won’t make much of a difference.

"Just as in the first debate, Clinton showed the depth of her experience in politics over the last 30 years.

"She tripped up during an answer about Wall Street where she countered that her work to aid the 9/11 recovery while a New York senator made her a crusader against Wall Street.

"Saturday debate began with a series of questions on terrorism and how America can combat ISIS, especially in light of the heinous attacks in Paris on Friday night.

"It was no surprise that Clinton was the most hawkish of the three candidates on stage. She talked of using airpower, training and equipping forces in the region and pushes our allies – especially Turkey and the Gulf States – to make up their minds about how much they’re going to help in this effort. Sanders and O’Malley had good rhetoric on the issue, but were vague and non-specific. And we also heard again that climate change is creating terrorism from Sanders – a claim that the Republicans will surely seize on.","3761","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"It must be noted that Clinton was trying to distance herself from Obama's statement that ISIS needs to be ""contained"" by saying they need to be ""defeated."" That being said, she did not declare war on ISIS. She did not forthrightly speak of the singular and unique role the U.S. must play in providing leadership, and sought to deflect attention from Sanders' efforts to link her with the rise of ISIS because of her support of the Iraq war by blaming George Bush.","3762","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"
"In short, it was a good and effective job for a Democratic primary audience, but all three candidates were on the defensive for much of the first part of the debate over the Middle East and the War on Terror. This will probably be a manageable challenge in the Democratic primary, but will almost certainly be a more serious challenge during the general election campaign.

"O’Malley got in on the action to tout how far he went as Maryland governor to raise wages, control gun violence and work to combat climate change. He certainly did better than he has before, but I don’t think he made a strong case for an O’Malley presidency. As Sanders pointed out, it’s not like Baltimore is doing too well right now.

"Sanders believes two things are of paramount importance: income inequality and climate change. His plans could push taxes on the rich upwards of 80 percent-- in a light moment he joked about Dwight Eisenhower levying a 90% tax -- and he’d bring back Glass-Steagall and break up the banks. Sanders supports a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition.

"These are all areas where you can see differences with Clinton. She only supports a $12 federal minimum wage and said it should be up to states/cities to raise it above that (this is also what Senate Democrats support). She wouldn’t break up the banks or bring back Glass-Steagall while at the same time arguing that her proposals go the furthest in reining in the banks.","3770","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-demonstates-why-shes-in-lead-at-second-democratic-debate.html"

"At least four classified Hillary Clinton emails had their markings changed to a category that shields the content from Congress and the public, Fox News has learned, in what State Department whistleblowers believed to be an effort to hide the true extent of classified information on the former secretary of state’s server.","Published September 01, 2015","3815","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/01/sources-clinton-email-markings-changed-to-hide-contents-shielding-extent.html"
"The changes, which came to light after the first tranche of 296 Benghazi emails was released in May, was confirmed by two sources -- one congressional, the other intelligence. The four emails originally were marked classified after a review by career officials at the State Department. But after a second review by the department's legal office, the designation was switched to ""B5"" -- also known as ""deliberative process,"" which refers to internal deliberations by the Executive Branch. Such discussions are exempt from public release.","3816","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/01/sources-clinton-email-markings-changed-to-hide-contents-shielding-extent.html"

"A congressional source told Fox that a July 23rd letter to Congress from the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community made passing reference to the incident in the recommendations ""...that State FOIA officials implement a dispute resolution process in regard to differences of opinion about classification levels and exemptions. State has not yet provided sufficient information for us to close this recommendations.""","3819","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/01/sources-clinton-email-markings-changed-to-hide-contents-shielding-extent.html"
"According to recent congressional testimony, at least one of the lawyers in the office where the changes were made is Catherine “Kate” Duval, who was at the IRS during the Lois Lerner e-mail scandal and now handles the release of documents to the Benghazi select committee.

"Fox News is told there were internal department complaints that Duval, and a second lawyer also linked to Kendall, gave at the very least the appearance of a conflict of interest during the email review. A State Department spokesman did not dispute the basic facts of the incident, confirming to Fox News the disagreement over the four classified emails as well as the internal complaints. But the spokesman said the concerns were unfounded.","3821","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/01/sources-clinton-email-markings-changed-to-hide-contents-shielding-extent.html"
"The whistleblowers told intelligence community officials that they did not agree with the B5 changes, and the changes had the effect of shielding the full extent of classified content on the server. The incident was referenced in a Washington Times report mid-August, but this is the first time fuller details have been available. Because the emails are now marked B5, or deliberative, it is impossible to know the content and relevance to the congressional and FBI investigations.","3822","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/01/sources-clinton-email-markings-changed-to-hide-contents-shielding-extent.html"
"The internal State Department disagreement was so significant that it rose to the level of Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who is deeply involved in the email controversy, as Clinton's server arrangement required his formal signoff or tacit approval.

"Asked to respond to the allegations, State Department spokesman John Kirby said, “the Department has complete confidence that its attorneys -- who are almost exclusively career Department lawyers -- perform to the highest professional and ethical standards, including in connection with the review and release of Secretary Clinton’s emails.” A State Department official added that the lawyers do not have the final say on the codes, emphasizing it is a “multi-step review.”","3825","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/01/sources-clinton-email-markings-changed-to-hide-contents-shielding-extent.html"
"On the appearance of a conflict of interest, Kirby defended Duval as “an exceptional professional and has the Department's utmost confidence … No one at the Department should, in addition to this burden, have her integrity or her excellent work ethic impugned.” And on the connection to Clinton attorney Kendall, “the mere fact of working at a firm does not itself constitute a conflict of interest. This is a large firm, and we are not aware that any counsel working on Clinton-related matters at the Department did so prior to joining the Department.”","3826","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/01/sources-clinton-email-markings-changed-to-hide-contents-shielding-extent.html"

"Chairman Trey Gowdy kicked things off with a passionate defense of his panel, insisting that the proceedings were purely professional and dismissing suggestions that the investigation is about the former secretary of State. “Let me assure you it is not,” he told Clinton.","3831","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"
"Ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings responded by blasting the probe, telling Clinton that the committee was set “loose because you’re running for president” and demanding that the Republicans end the “fishing expedition.”","3832","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"
"In short, the media atmosphere surrounding the much-anticipated session had turned poisonous before Hillary opened her mouth—and Republicans largely have themselves to blame.","3833","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"
"When Kevin McCarthy shot himself in the foot on Sean Hannity’s show, saying the committee had knocked down Hillary’s poll numbers, he did more than hand her a gift. He changed the public perception, which was further muddied when another GOP congressman made that charge, as did an ex-staffer fired under disputed circumstances.","3834","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"
"An ABC/Washington Post poll found 53 percent of those surveyed believe the panel’s purpose is to damage Clinton politically, while 35 percent say it is raising legitimate concerns. At the same time, 57 percent disapprove of her handling of the email mess, while 36 percent approve.","3835","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"

"For the most part, the hearing was conducted professionally, starting with Gowdy’s decision to swear in Clinton privately to avoid the raised-hand shot that can be politically damaging.","3838","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"
"As has become standard procedure in Hill hearings these days, Republican members were aggressive with the Democratic presidential candidate, and Democrats played defense and tried to set up Clinton for rebuttals.

"One of the most openly hostile lawmakers was Republican Jim Jordan, who essentially called Clinton a liar amid talk of a newly disclosed email in which she had told her family Benghazi was a terrorist attack while the administration initially blamed an anti-Muslim video. “Where did the false narrative start? It started with you, Madam Secretary,” Jordan said. She dug in and said she was sorry her responses didn't fit his narrative.‎","3840","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"
"Democrat Adam Schiff rushed to Clinton’s defense, declaring: “After 17 months we have nothing new to tell the American people.” He invited Clinton to reflect on the allegations that she misled the country, leading to her most emotional moment.","3841","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"
"“It’s a very personally painful accusation,” Clinton said. “Having it continued to be bandied around is deeply distressing to me. I would imagine that I’ve thought more about what happened than all of you put together.”","3842","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"
"That prompted Gowdy to say he was not conducting a “prosecution.” But the proceedings soon dissolved into squabbling over emails from Hillary confidante Sid Blumenthal--who also worked for the Clinton Foundation and Media Matters and was trying to do business with Libya--as Democrats questioned why this was relevant to the probe.","3843","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/hillary-helped-by-partisan-media-atmosphere-undermining-benghazi-hearing.html"

"Longtime Hillary Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal allegedly sent her an email with the name of a CIA source, further casting doubt on her claim she never sent or received classified information on her private email address, according to the Republican chairman of the committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks.","Published October 08, 2015","3852","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., provided this and other details Thursday, as part of a batch of new Clinton emails he says will shed light on Blumenthal’s complex role as unofficial political adviser to then-Secretary of State Clinton.","3853","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"“It is curious Secretary Clinton took so much of her advice from someone who had never been to Libya, professed no independent knowledge of the country and who the White House blocked her from hiring,” Gowdy said in a statement Thursday.","3854","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"He detailed the emails in a letter to the panel’s ranking Democrat, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings. He said he plans to release the emails on Oct. 12, but previewed them extensively in his letter.","3855","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"At one point, Blumenthal apparently suggested President Obama back military intervention in Libya in 2011 to help boost his poll numbers; in another spate of emails, according to Gowdy, he appeared to be promoting a company run by an associate that provides training for Libya rebels. In others, he appeared to be mocking Obama and his White House advisers.","3856","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"In yet another email, Gowdy claims Blumenthal wrote to Clinton citing the name of a “human source” for the CIA. ""Armed with that information,"" Gowdy writes, ""Senator Clinton forwarded the email to a colleague -- debunking her claim that she never sent any classified information from her private email address.""","3857","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"One-third of the emails, according to Gowdy, are to/from Blumenthal, who was not a government employee at the time but appeared to send Clinton a steady stream of emails full of foreign policy advice before and after the U.S. intervention in Libya.","3858","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Gowdy’s email release comes at a sensitive time for the Republican-led committee. The panel has taken a drubbing in the press lately, after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., suggested in an interview with Fox News that the panel could be linked to Hillary Clinton’s dropping poll numbers, fueling Democratic claims the committee is political in nature. He later explained he “never meant to imply” that was the case.","3859","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Cummings’ office hit back on the latest salvo on Thursday, calling it “a defensive and desperate attempt to save face,” that only proves Gowdy is more focused on embarrassing Clinton than investigating the 2012 attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.","3860","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Cumming said Democrats have been asking Gowdy for weeks to release the full load of Clinton emails, as well as the entire transcript of Blumenthal’s eight-hour deposition to the committee, “in which he answered hundreds of questions form Republicans about his e-mail.”","3861","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Nevertheless, the committee is painting a more colorful picture of Blumenthal’s role as an unofficial adviser at a time when the U.S. was considering its controversial foray into Libya. A year after the government fell with the help of the U.S. and its allies, militants attacked the diplomatic compound and today Libya remains a volatile, failed state.","3862","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Gowdy says the new emails suggest Blumenthal is a “political body” who pushed for a more aggressive posture on Libya -- including sustained bombing and training and arming rebels on the ground in 2011 – to boost administration poll numbers.","3863","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"From one apparent email quoted by Gowdy:","3864","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"“Obama should think about the political effect here in the U.S. of defeat of Qathafi’s forces,” Blumenthal apparently wrote of the Libyan dictator, who was eventually killed by opposition forces. “He wants to be re-elected? It would be interesting to see how his prospects would be affected by Qathafi’s continuing presence in Tripoli in November 2012 and the mockery Republicans will rain down on him over his present weakness.”","3865","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"According to Gowdy, Blumenthal was a bit snarky when talking about the Obama administration, at one point reportedly writing that “[Obama] and his political cronies in the WH and Chicago are, to say the least, unenthusiastic about regime change in Libya or anywhere else in the ME. Why is that? Hmmm.”","3866","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Blumenthal also allegedly mocked “National Security Adviser Tom Donilon’s babbling rhetoric about ‘narratives’” on a phone briefing with reporters.","3867","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Gowdy says most of Blumenthal’s shared intel on Libya came from his associates, former high-ranking CIA operative Tyler Drumheller, and Cody Shearer.","3868","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Gowdy argues the new emails also show Blumenthal had a monetary interest in seeing the U.S. intervention in Libya go forward, noting that Blumenthal and Drumheller have acknowledged their stake in Osprey Global Solutions, a private security company. But the emails tell more of the story, Gowdy says, pointing to excepts that appear to reference a deal between Osprey and the National Transition Council (TNR) in Libya.","3869","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"At one point, according to a portion in the letter, Blumenthal wrote that, “Tyler, Cody and I acted as honest brokers, putting this arrangement together through a series of connections, linking the Libyans to Osprey and keeping it moving.” The arrangement, as described, was to help train and organize the opposition forces.","3870","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"For her part, Clinton appeared interested in her short responses to Blumenthal, according Gowdy, often forwarding the memos to top aide Jake Sullivan and asking him to read and respond to her later. In reaction to Blumenthal’s alarms about poll numbers and Obama’s ‘present weakness’ over Libya, Clinton apparently told Sullivan: “This is quite troubling … I agree about the need to keep the attack tempo up.”","3871","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"After Blumenthal was brought for a private interview with the committee in June, his lawyer James M. Cole wrote a letter to Gowdy, criticizing Republicans’ decision to leak only portions of his testimony and emails to the press.","3872","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"“Leaks like these are distorting the truth by mischaracterizing facts and circumstances,” Cole wrote. “They are creating an incomplete and unfair narrative about the deposition, Mr. Blumenthal’s knowledge about Libya, and the tragedy that occurred in Benghazi.”","3873","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"
"Cole could not be reached for comment on the letter Thursday.","3874","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/08/benghazi-committee-blumenthal-promoted-passed-along-name-cia-source-pushed-for.html"

"“Let's not be naive about it.

"The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign.

"He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”","4034","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.

"Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” The senator also claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.”","4036","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"

"The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.","4044","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"

"O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.","4046","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"

"But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”","4048","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.","4049","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.","4050","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.","4051","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"

"Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.","4053","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"
"Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.”","4054","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate.html"

"With Hillary and Bernie broadcasting in advance that they wouldn’t attack each other personally and Anderson Cooper vowing there would be no “gotcha” questions, many folks envisioned a snoozefest.

"In what sounded a bit like reading the talking points, Hillary kept saying she would be the first woman president—both in response to questions about whether she’d run Barack Obama’s third term and why the country shouldn’t elect an outsider. It was her get-out-of-jail-free card. She even made a joke about taking longer during a bathroom break.","4062","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/13/hillary-moves-left-bests-bernie-with-just-two-email-questions.html"
"Cooper had many pointed questions.

"Gun control is one of the few issues where Hillary is to Bernie’s left, having previously moved toward his more liberal stance on trade and the Keystone pipeline.

"Foreign policy was difficult terrain for Sanders. He challenged Clinton’s idea for a Syria no-fly zone as dangerous and kept defaulting to the fact that he had opposed the Iraq war—with the clear implication that Hillary did not. The senator was finally forced to declare “I am prepared to take this country into war” if necessary.","4068","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/13/hillary-moves-left-bests-bernie-with-just-two-email-questions.html"
